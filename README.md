# Character Mentions in the Office

## Shiny app for <a href = "https://ejclarke.shinyapps.io/officem/">mobile</a> and <a href = "https://ejclarke.shinyapps.io/office/">desktop</a>

Using transcripts from <a href = "http://www.officequotes.net/">OfficeQuotes.Net</a>, I parsed each season of The Office to see who was mentioned the most and who talked about whom. I used Python 3, R, and a litte manual editing in Notepad++.

The result is an interactive visualization in R/Shiny, which I've optimized for mobile as well as desktop. I used the 35 characters listed as main or recurring on <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)_characters">Wikipedia</a> and tried to incorporate common nicknames in my search parameters.

If you'd like to see the process, all of my Python code (and the source files) are in the wrangling folder. The app and mobileapp folders contain the R code that I used to create the app. This was a single day project.
