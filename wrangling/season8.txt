Oscar: Oh, for God’s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
 
Oscar: Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That’s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
 
Erin: Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don’t.  And I don’t.  But I am so excited to be a part of it.
 
Andy: [exiting elevator] After you my good sir. 
Dwight: No, I insist. 
Andy: I insist.
 
Jim: The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California… for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.  He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don’t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.   And he chose…
 
Andy: [drumroll with hands] I… it’s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice’s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, “I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.” Smart, right? 
Kelly: (planking on top of cabinet] Very smart. 
Andy: Uh, this has got to stop. 
Kelly: I can’t get down.
 
Dwight: K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight’s desk]
 
Dwight: Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I’ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I’ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I’m doin’ great.
 
Dwight: K, I’m gonna need some help. Pam? 
Pam: I don’t think I should.
 
Jim: Oh, yeah. Pregnant. 
Pam: Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly] 
Jim: No, I told you I don’t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early. 
Pam: Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
 
Angela: Look, it’s a ‘Little Pregs’ [points to her belly] and ‘Big Pregs’ [points to Pam’s] 
Pam: Wait, when did we start calling it that- 
Angela: Isn’t it amazing, the difference in our sizes? 
Pam: Well, I am a few months ahead of you. 
Angela: I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
 
Dwight: Hoist him aloft. C’mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk] 
Darryl: I’m lifting.
 
Darryl: Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin’ much better. This soda. This is mine.
 
Stanley: It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
 
Stanley: I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I’m telling someone how to do somethin’. I go on with a long description and then I say, “and shove it up your butt.” It’s stupid, but it’s my thing now.
 
Jim: No one should be planking at all. 
Andy: Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this? 
Dwight: Say no more.
 
Dwight: [starts attacking plankers] Kids, don’t try planking. It’s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ‘Specially with me around.
 
Jim: You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it’s just gonna make you cry? 
Pam: Because everything makes me cry, so what’s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone. 
Jim: He’s got a bank vault. That’s a start. 
Pam: Not enough though.
 
Jim: The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he’s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it’s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It’s strange.
 
Erin: Here we go. 
Robert: Hello. 
Erin: Robert California. Let’s have a conversation. 
Robert: Describe your day so far. 
Erin: Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze- 
Robert: And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It’s a waste of your time. That’s how every day’s begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man. 
Erin: Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I’ve been doing this thing- 
Andy: Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
 
Andy: First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don’t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
 
Erin: Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert’s notebook] 
Pam: Jim. [motions him over] 
Jim: [motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
 
Andy: The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts? 
Robert: What are your thoughts. 
Andy: Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women’s soccer, no?
 
Dwight: What are you looking at? 
Jim: It’s, it’s nothing. 
Dwight: It can’t be nothing. 
Phyllis: Yeah, it can’t be nothing. 
Jim:  It’s just a list of our names, split into two columns. 
Stanley: What? 
Jim: Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen? 
Erin: No. 
Jim: No. Okay. Um, I’ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
Dwight: [throws hard, Jim doesn’t catch] Nice catch. 
Pam: If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier] 
Kevin: We need a warning signal. 
Jim: We don’t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there- 
Kevin: We do. 
Jim: I promise you, we don’t need a warning- 
Kevin: WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! 
Phyllis: Ahhh! [falls out of chair] 
Dwight: Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay? 
Phyllis: Yeah. Yeah. Oh. 
Dwight: … 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up] 
Phyllis: Thanks guys. 
Dwight: Okay, which side of the list am I on? 
Jim: Left. 
Dwight: Yes! 
Jim: Why are you- How do you know?
 
Andy: Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work. 
Jim: Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert’s notebook. 
Pam: He left it at reception and we photocopied it. 
Andy: Oh, okay. I don’t want any part of this. 
Pam: Maybe it’s a list of people he’s gonna fire. 
Jim: Okay, it’s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
 
Dwight: This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here’s something. Who would eat who in an ‘Alive’ situation. No... that can’t be it. 
Andy: I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side’s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam. 
Jim: I don’t think it’s- 
Pam: ‘Scuse me? 
Dwight: Shhh, Pam. C’mon, don’t be such a right-sider.
 
Angela: Did you guys figure it out? 
Andy: We couldn’t crack it. 
Stanley: Go in there and just ask the man what it means. 
Andy: He’ll know that we looked at his private notebook. 
Phyllis: C’mon, just say you saw the list by accident. 
Andy: I’m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it’s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time. 
Phyllis: Yeah, that’s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
 
Robert: [Andy continuously knocking on door] Yes, for god’s sake Andy. Yes, come in. 
Andy: What’s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk. 
Robert: Great. Thank you. 
Andy: And it was open. And people saw this. And they’re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is. 
Robert: What is this? 
Andy: It’s a photocopy from your notebook. 
Robert: You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it. 
Andy: No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it. 
Robert: Ah, please. Here’s what it is. It’s a doodle. 
Andy: What? 
Robert: Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don’t you think? Well, I doodle too, but I’m not an artist. So I draw words and lists. 
Andy: That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name? 
Robert: Might as well have been sketching a cube.
 
Andy: Okay. Robert’s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common? 
Meredith: Maybe we’re s’posed to do it with people in our group. 
Jim: That’s not it. 
Meredith: People in the other group. 
Jim: Mmum, still wrong. 
Andy: Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got? 
Stanley: Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ‘em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT! 
Andy: Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys. 
Kevin: I know! It’s alphabetical. 
Everyone: [separately] No. 
Dwight: No, it’s not. Here’s how we find out. Let’s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let’s just size each other up here and left side of the list… ATTACK! 
Jim: Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling] 
Andy: Dwight! 
Meredith: Hey! 
Kevin: Warning! Warning! Warning! 
Robert: [enters room, everyone quiets and separates] I’d like to invite the following people to join me for lunch: Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar. 
Dwight: That’s great. Let’s do this guys. 
Jim: Alright, well, I will see you in a bit. 
Pam: I love you so much. [starting to cry] 
Jim: Hey. It’s nothing. Alright? I’ll text you when we get there. Let you know what’s going on. 
Pam: Okay. [turns to computer] 
Jim: Nope. No dog video. 
Pam: Okay. 
Jim: Okay. See you guys. 
Andy: Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
 
Robert: Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street? 
Jim: Uhhh, the street? 
Robert: Sesame street. 
Jim: Oh, I didn’t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo. 
Robert: Elmo, god’s sake, it’s the Elmo era. 
Jim: Right. 
Robert: Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn’t you agree. 
Jim: Yeah, she does like Elmo. 
Oscar: Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree. 
Phyllis: Completely. 
Darryl: Apt. Apt analysis, Robert. 
Kevin: The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling. 
Toby: I should not be here. I’m in the- I was in the wrong- I’m- I’m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
 
Andy: Great group! Pizza party! 
Kelly: How is this a pizza party? 
Andy: Well, why don’t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here. 
Kelly: Yeah, well, that’s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party. 
Andy: Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza? 
Stanley: What’s that? 
Andy: Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese. 
Stanley: That’s pizza. 
Pam: That’s regular pizza.
 
Dwight: You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group? 
Robert: I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you. 
Dwight: Okay! 
Everyone: [separately] Awww. 
Phyllis: Well, what about the other guys. 
Dwight: Losers. 
Robert: No. 
Dwight: C’mon. 
Robert: I don’t- I don’t wanna say- 
Dwight: C’mon, c’mon. 
Robert: No, no. 
Dwight: C’mon. 
Robert: Ha, I guess I think they’re losers. 
Dwight: Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo! 
Robert: Probably shouldn’t have said that. [Jim’s jaw drops]
 
Andy: Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched. 
Pam: [Pam’s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. “This is getting very weird. Will explain later.” 
Pam: [Everyone’s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Kevin. 
Meredith: “Suck it losers.”
 
Ryan: Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn’t the fact that I’m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp! 
Pam: I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, “Who’s that receptionist? I like her.” Now I’m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you’re like, “Oh, loser.” 
Andy: C’mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously? 
Pam: Oh. Oh God. 
Kelly: [door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch? 
Angela: It was excellent. 
Darryl: Good times. 
Andy: Yeah? 
Dwight: Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it’s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
 
Kevin: I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
 
Jim: Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright? 
Pam: Yeah, I’m fine.
 
Kevin: [spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up “L” to his forehead] 
Meredith: [on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It’ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
 
Andy: When I was a salesman I could just be like “Not my job, not my prob. I’m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.” Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
 
Andy: Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it’s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let’s say top-tier and others would be second-tier. 
Robert: I never said that. 
Andy: Thank you. Great. Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you’re talking about? 
Andy: Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I’m thinking of. Can you clarify that? 
Robert: Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I’ll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you’re a winner. If I didn’t, I don’t. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong. 
Phyllis: Whew, well. I guess that’s that. 
Andy: No. No, no. 
Erin: Andy, don’t go in there! 
Andy: I’m going in there.
 
Andy: I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don’t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I’m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list. 
Robert: I’m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don’t use ballpoint pens. 
Andy: Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he’s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he’s hard to love, but did you know that he’s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships? 
Robert: I did not know about the sales figures. 
Andy: Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word “no” not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I’m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with. 
Dwight: Jim, shut the door. This is just gross. 
Jim: Shhh. 
Andy: Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
 
Erin: I like my new group. I liked my old group.
 
Robert: Are we done? 
Andy: Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we’re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend. 
Robert: You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day? 
Andy: Yes, I do. 
Robert: And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans. 
Andy: I don’t care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits]
 
Andy: Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday. 
Stanley: We get that every year. 
Andy: Well, you got it this year too. 
Phyllis: Good night, Andy. 
Andy: Night. 
Angela: Bye. 
Oscar: Good night Andy. 
Dwight: Good night. 
Andy: Night.
 
Jim: Alright, I’m gonna go warm up the car. 
Pam: Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?
 
Pam: Okay, I know I’ve been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, “Pam” and “Cece” on one side, “Everything else” on the other] I mean, that’s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it’s stupid. No. [starts crying] It’s wonderful. I’m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
 
Deleted Scene 1
 
Andy: I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated. 
Kelly: Everybody hates those endings! 
Pam: [weepy] Yeah, I hate those endings.
 
Oscar: I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.] 
Kevin: I was looking for patterns. 
Oscar: I know.
 
Ryan: It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him. 
Creed: I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless. 
Toby: Guys. Really, it's ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to worry.
 
Toby: I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.
 
Deleted Scene 2
 
Dwight: [grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast. 
Jim: Ryan? A little help? 
Dwight: God. How do whalers do it?
 
Ryan: Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
 
Andy: Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead!
 
Gabe: Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly]
 
Gabe: Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I'm in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn't get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.
 
Ryan: It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
 
Deleted Scene 3
 
Jim: Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad. 
Robert: That sounds good. 
Kevin: Chicken piccata, side salad. 
Darryl: Chicken piccata, salad on the side please. 
Oscar: I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata. 
Toby: Chicken piccata, side salad. 
Angela: Side salad, chicken piccata on the side. 
Phyllis: I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata. 
Dwight: Steak. Rare. 
Robert: Jim, you alright? What are you doing? 
Jim: Good. What? Nothin'
 
Pam: Oh! Text from Jim. “This is...” hmm. 
Ryan: Profound man, your husband.
 
Dwight: One more. To our boss! 
All: Hey! 
Jim: I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses] 
Dwight: You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure. 
Robert: I can expense it. 
Darryl & Oscar: Let him expense it, Dwight. 
Dwight: I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please? 
Robert: Thank you. 
Waiter: Hi, Mr. Shrute. I've waited on you before. I just wanted to let you know that gratuity is not included in the bill and tips are expected. 
Dwight: Oh, tips are expected? 
Waiter: Yes sir. 
Dwight: Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
 
Gabe: My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you'll be part of them. You'll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out. 
Meredith: Hey, this ain't no Breakfast Club, bitch.
 
Dwight: Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! 
Jim: Come on, man. 
Dwight: Winners!

Jim: Hey, so this isn’t matching up with this…and I’m not sure which one’s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me? 
Kevin: Yes. Me do. 
Jim: Alright.
 
Jim: Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork? 
Kevin: Me do it now. Go. Stop worry. 
Pam: Kevin, do you feel OK? 
Kevin: Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night. 
Pam: Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital. 
Jim: Yeah, alright Kev why don’t you come with us? 
Oscar: No, guys. 
Angela: No, he’s fine. 
Oscar: He’s fine. 
Angela: He’s always been like that. 
Pam: No he hasn’t. 
Angela: I mean, he’s gotten worse over the years…. 
Oscar: He’s making a statement. It’s an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin. 
Kevin: You keep think that.
 
Kevin: Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say “car no go”, and we best friends. So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
 
Andy: Kevin, I appreciate what you’re trying to do. 
Kevin: Thank. 
Andy: Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we’re talking about is…basically the speech equivalent… to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use…but need need for talk talk. 
Kevin: But save time. More success. 
Jim: Does it save time though? ‘Cause we’ve been here for about an hour. 
Kevin: No me fault. 
Pam: Kevin, at most you’re saving a microscopic amount of time. 
Kevin: Many small time make big time. 
Andy: What are you gonna do with all this time? 
Kevin: See world. 
Pam: Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world. 
Jim: K, Kevin, are you saying “See the world”? or “Sea World?” 
Kevin: See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China. 
Jim: No, see? Right there, that’s the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don’t know if you’re saying “Sea World” or “see the world,” and it’s taking a lot of time to explain it. 
Kevin: Fine, fine. I’ll talk normally.
 
Kevin: When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling] They see.
 
Dwight: This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet….the Pyramid. [holds up triangle shaped touch pad] 
Phyllis: Ooh, why is it shaped like that? 
Dwight: So, you can tell your clients: “Unleash the power of the pyramid.” 
Pam: It’s huge. How much does it weigh? 
Dwight: Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it’s barely three pounds. 
Ryan: How much memory does it have without the booster? 
Dwight: Fifty L. 
Ryan: I’m sorry,” L”? 
Jim: How many L to a K? 
Dwight: You’re really going to want the booster. 
Stanley: How on earth are we supposed to sell…? 
Jim: I’ll take five. 
[Andy walks in with ties on his arm] 
Phyllis: Andy, don’t make us sell this stupid thing. 
Andy: Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight’s meeting. 
Dwight: Thank you. 
Andy: I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties…and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN? 
Oscar: …”C-SPAN”? 
Andy: Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause…… 
Dwight: Is this really the best use of our collective time? 
Andy: I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I’m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog…had to pull rank.
Dwight: [to group] OK, let’s look at some ties.
 
Dwight: Here’s how I’m going to help out from now on. I’m going to not care, and I’m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy’s inevitable demise.
 
Dwight: [To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night. 
Erin: Um, D-Dog, you have a message. 
Pam: Erin, you don’t need to call him that. 
Erin: Andy wants us to, P-Dog. 
Darryl: It’s ok E-Dog, just who called? 
Erin: Justine. She said she’s coming by later. 
Jim: Your ex-wife? 
Kevin: Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts? 
[Group murmurs, offended] 
Darryl: No no no no. I like her. 
Kevin: Well I’m just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don’t know the woman. 
Darryl: Nah man, we get along now. Real well. 
Jim: Wow. Alright. Can’t wait to meet her. 
Darryl: I’ll introduce you.
 
Darryl: Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can’t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night…. I have to sing it. [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
 
Andy: [to Robert California] Hi Dad!...... Ahhh….oh boy. 
Robert: Hello, Andy. Excellent tie. 
Erin: Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you’re here? 
Robert: I’d love some coffee.
 
Robert: I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better. 
Andy: Are you factoring in the… whole national …economy…. declining and all that? 
Robert: Andy, do you know why I chose you? 
Andy: I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor….vanilla? 
Robert: Vanilla? No no no no. You’ll never guess in a million billion years you’ll never guess. 
Andy: You were saying you chose me…. There was a reason? 
Robert: Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?
 
Andy: Can I inspire? [laughs] I don’t know!.....I don’t know.
 
[Erin enters with overflowing cup of coffee] 
Robert: Oh! Thank you. Uh…. 
Erin: Oh, sorry. 
Robert: You can just put it down. 
Erin: Oh 
[Erin sets cup down and Robert sips it] 
Robert: That is very cold. 
Erin: Yeah. It’s old. [smiling] 
Robert: Why would I…..? 
Erin: I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said “coffee”…. 
Andy: Why don’t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this. 
Erin: Andy, you don’t want that. 
Andy: I’ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm…. 
Erin: Sorry. 
Robert: You like her. 
Andy: I do. 
Robert: She likes you. 
Andy: You know, we’ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we’re in this weird dance…. 
Robert: [interrupting] I’m afraid you’ve lost my interest.
 
Oscar: Let me call you back. 
Meredith: I gotta go. 
Robert: If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here? 
[Kevin Raises hand] 
Robert: Ah… 
Kevin: This is where we go 
Robert: [chuckling] Oh, you’d go someplace else. That’s not it, that’s not the answer. 
Kevin: It’s a answer. 
Robert: It’s a wrong answer. 
Kevin: There are no wrong answers. 
Robert: Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it’s birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why? 
Phyllis: Wait….they’re terrified? 
Robert: Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don’t know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You’ll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them “you are welcome.” [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it. 
Andy: You got it. 
Robert: Double. 
Andy: Done. 
Robert: I’m not kidding. 
Andy: Neither am I, it’s already done. Hah, I’m just kidding, it’s going to take some time. 
Robert: Double.
 
[Andy knocks on Jim’s desk] 
Jim: Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim’s desk, kicking things in the process.] 
Andy: What’s up, guys? Just thought we’d have a little rap session, talk about business…see how things are going? Ahem… 
Jim: Why don’t you start? 
Andy: If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert…man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how’s the sales doubling …project going? 
Phyllis: Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can’t just press a magic button. 
Andy: OF course not. There’s no magic button. You have to summon that. 
Stanley: If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You’re not making any sense. 
Jim: He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door? 
Andy: Dwight, anything? 
Dwight: We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they’re out of the house. 
Andy: You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna. 
Jim: New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door… 
Andy: Fart….. good Sesh. [gets up] That leg’s asleep.
 
Justine: Hello. I’m looking for Darryl Philbin? 
Kevin: Don’t! oh, you must think…I’m not. I’m using the fax, this isn’t, no wait. I’m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There’s usually an Erin here. 
Justine: Ok….? 
Kevin: So…DARRYL! A GIRL! 
Darryl: [Singing] rub a dub dub…I got scrubbed. ‘Sup, darlin’? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody. 
Meredith: Hi. 
Kevin: Kevin. 
Justine: Can we…. go some place private? 
Darryl: Follow me, I got a space. After you. I’ve been thinking about you all mornin’. I don’t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
 
Andy: D-Bone. There you are. 
Dwight: Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie…? Lick the spoon? 
Andy: No, that’s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about… 
Dwight: Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don’t see the point. It’s so Wall Street. 
Andy: I know, right? 
Dwight: Right? 
Andy: Yeah…um, how is everything? 
Dwight: Good. Really really good. 
Andy: Must be a tough time to be a family farm. 
Dwight: Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back. 
Andy: Oof. What are you gonna do about that? 
Dwight: I don’t know, what do you mean? 
Andy: There’s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales… 
Dwight: You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I’ll do mine….. walnuts? 
Kevin: No!
 
Angela: Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine] 
Pam: Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici’s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies. 
Jim: She looks at it when she’s on the potty, and she makes the faces. 
Angela: Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue? 
Pam: I flipped through it. 
Angela: So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you’re pregnant? 
Pam: Of course. 
Jim: We know that. 
Pam: Yeah. 
Angela: I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me? 
Pam: That sounds nice. 
Angela: Great.[Angela walks away] 
Jim: You have a walking buddy. 
Pam: I do.
 
Andy: Thanks for coming in guys. 
Phyllis: You don’t have to thank us for coming in, it’s our job. 
Andy: Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I’m gonna thank people. 
Meredith: What’s with the blanket? 
[Andy removes blanket over table to reveal various items] 
Andy: This is what’s under the blanket. 
Oscar: We don’t get it. 
Andy: These are incentives. It’s how we’re gonna double growth. Now, you’re probably all asking yourselves: “Well, how does this work?” 
Pam: Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes. 
Andy: You’re exactly right and you get a point. 
Pam: Oh. [smiling] 
Ryan: Uh, is that a vibrator? 
Andy: Twenty points. 
Meredith: How does one get a point? 
Andy: I’ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear. 
Kelly: Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It’s so gross. 
Andy: There’s lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt. 
Stanley: How ‘bout you want us to work harder, pay us more. 
Andy: I can’t. 
Kelly: This point system is really insulting. 
Andy: Ooh I didn’t mean to offend you, and I hope you’ll forgive me because I am very very… Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.
Kelly: That’s a tablecloth. 
Jim: What if we went all the way up to five hundred points? 
Andy: That’s a crazy amount of points. 
Jim: But, what if? 
Andy: Well, what do you want? 
Jim: I don’t know, for such a crazy number I’d like something pretty crazy. 
Andy: Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter] 
Jim: That’s pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points? 
Andy: I’ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end] 
Group: Ooooh! 
Oscar: Really? 
Jim: Alright, alright. And you are totally serious? 
Andy: Swear to God, hope to die. Now let’s get to work! 
Jim: Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case…let’s get to work. 
Dwight: Yeah! 
Pam: Yeah! Whoo! [Group cheers]
 
Jim: [on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto? 
Phyllis:[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen’s bananas. 
Jim: Ok. 
Andy: T-bag bone… 
Jim: Andrew. 
Andy: Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here? 
Jim: No, I didn’t notice anything. 
Andy: Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years….and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him. 
Stanley: [On the phone] You’ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid! 
Jim: I don’t know what to tell you, man. 
Andy: You think it has something to do with that incentive program? 
Jim: Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass. 
Andy: Bah…I think people thought I was kidding when I said that. 
Jim: Nah, you definitely weren’t kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper] 
Andy: Hundred and twenty points. 
Jim: Yeah. Big sale. Don’t worry about it though, I don’t really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though…[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald…can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt] 
Pam: Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman’s? 
Erin: Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.] 
Jim: [on the phone]and I’m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right? 
Pam: Where’s Angela? [Hands paper over her shoulder] 
Andy: Hey Kevin, what are you doing? 
Kevin: Don’t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
 
Andy: [on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ’95. Hey there, um, I’m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here…De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale…uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I’m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs]
 
[Erin fills in drawing showing points, crowd cheers and claps]
 
Andy: Took ‘em one day. 
Pam: Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] “I’m not as think as you drunk I am!” [crowd claps and cheers] 
Ryan: I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page] 
Pam: Do Not Resuscitate…[mild cheering] 
Andy: OK, keep in mind, it’s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions. My car [nervous laughter] for a thousand points….or best offer. 
Phyllis: What else you got? 
Pam: Oh, and then this was Phyllis’s idea…[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!
 
Pam: We were hoping you could do something like this… 
Tattoo Artist: So, coming out of his butt is a… 
Pam: Baby. 
Tattoo Artist: Baby… 
Pam: Yes. 
Tattoo Artist: Yeah, no problem. 
Andy: We should think about this…does anyone have any better ideas? 
Stanley: I like what we have. 
Meredith: Looks good. 
Erin: Yeah. 
Kevin: For sure. [murmurs from group in agreement] 
Andy: Just need a second outside.
 
Jim: Gettin’ psyched up? 
Andy: Yeah. 
Jim: Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this… 
Andy: Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ….Confession: I don’t know what I’m doing. 
Jim: I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun….and you did that. 
Andy: My ass is only so big, I mean I can’t do this everyday. 
Jim: But I think it’s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea….which, by the way, I can’t wait for. 
Andy: No one expects me to go through with this, right? 
Jim: Absolutely not.
 
Andy: Let’s ink…my stink! [crowd cheers]
 
Andy: My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
 
[Andy removes his pants] 
Group: Whoa! 
Andy: [lying on table] Do your worst! 
Tattoo Artist: Uh, you can keep your pants on actually…if just drop ‘em down a bit, that’d be great. 
Andy: They are already off, my good sir. 
Tattoo Artist: I’d really prefer they not be down. 
Andy: Well, I think down’s better. Sweating pretty heavily down there. 
Pam: Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments. 
Tattoo Artist: OK, you want me to… 
Pam: Just a few adjustments 
Tattoo Artist: Alright, let’s begin. 
Andy: This is where I grin and be-YOW OW! 
Tattoo Artist: That was just the cotton swab. 
Andy: Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!
 
Dwight: Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I’m gonna like it.
 
Dwight: DRAW SOME BLOOD! 
Andy: AHHHHH!!!!!!!
 
Robert: Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he’s all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.
 
Andy: [removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It’s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That’s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it! 
Jim: Pull up your pants.
 
Robert: There’s something about an underdog that really inspires…the unexceptional.
 
Pam: Um, what should we talk about? 
Angela: Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I’m having. 
Pam: Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help. 
Angela: A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don’t know if I should call social services about it. 
Pam: Angela, that’s pretty transparently me. 
Angela: Maybe. 
Pam: You know it’s just herbal tea. 
Angela: In mugs with trace amounts of coffee! 
Pam: Yeah. I think you should call social services. 
Angela: I already did. 
Pam: You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we’re in this together. 
Angela: Fine. 
Pam: Fine.

Dwight: ....back orders and you never called them. 
Oscar: Can you believe this? 
Erin: There's a dog in the car. 
Oscar: You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to “I'd rather be snowboarding” bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures. 
Jim: Do Snowboarders hate animals? 
Oscar: I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous. 
Andy: Oscar, it's not that hot out. 
Darryl: A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven. 
Andy: Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight. 
Kelly: So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag? 
Kevin: Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog. 
Dwight: OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on. 
Jim: Dwight! At least aim it. 
Dwight: There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on. 
Andy: We're losing cloud cover. 
Kelly: Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick. 
Darryl: Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time. 
Oscar: This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron] 
Jim: Whoa whoa whoa whoa! 
Oscar: Come on buddy, get back. 
Dwight: Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers] 
Jim: Alright! Nice job, Oscar! 
Oscar: And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds] 
Jim: So...ah, who's gonna take the dog? 
Oscar: Why would we take the dog? 
Jim: What if he jumps out the window and runs away? 
Oscar: Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks] 
Meredith: Whoa! 
Oscar: Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay. 
Dwight: Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot. 
Jim: Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog? 
Oscar: [Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it. 
Jim: Yeah, that's pretty good. 
Dwight: Yeah, that'll work. 
Kelly: That'll work. 
Jim: Nice job. 
Dwight: Bye poochie! 
Kelly: Bye. [Andy barks] 
Meredith: Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
 
Pam: What's that come to? Like, what did they each win? 
Jim: Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars. 
Pam: Awesome. 
Dwight: Before taxes. 
Phyllis: That's still a lot of money!
 
Andy: The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. [shot shows warehouse crew going wild in the office] This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.
 
Darryl: [On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
 
Darryl: When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won … playing my birthday.
 
Oscar: What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right? 
Phyllis: Yeah. 
Meredith: We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing. 
Oscar: At least. 
Jim: I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money. 
Dwight: I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] “Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.” 
Jim: No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop. 
Pam: And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids? 
Jim: Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine? 
Pam: I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo... 
Ryan: SoHo's mostly lofts but OK. 
Pam: And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting... 
Kelly: Oh, god. 
Pam: And then my handsome husband... 
Jim: Which ideally would be me.... 
Pam: Would bring me a flavored coffee. 
Jim: Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy? 
Pam: Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters. 
Jim: I don't know about Stephen King, I mean... 
Meredith: [under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
 
Kelly: I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
 
Andy: Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys? 
Darryl: I don't know. 
Andy: What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what? 
Darryl: No. 
Andy: Are they on their way over? 
Darryl: I haven't hired anyone. 
Phyllis: What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it. 
Darryl: I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week. 
Andy: This is kinda time sensitive. 
Darryl: I got it. I'm doin' it. 
Phyllis: Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client. 
Andy: Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand] 
Erin: As long as you guys don't need me up here. 
Phyllis: No..we don't 
Dwight: I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement] 
Oscar: Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead? 
Andy: Are you volunteering? 
Oscar: Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes] 
Andy: Jim! How 'bout you? 
Jim: Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you... 
Dwight: Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer. 
Andy: Great. And Kevin.
 
Kevin: Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
 
Pam: Oh, thank you. 
Angela: Sure. 
Pam: Wait, wait. What's this? [holds up clipboard] 
Angela: Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool. 
Pam: It says “Lotto Pool”, right on top. [points to obvious title] 
Angela: Yeah. And I said sorry. 
Pam: Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
 
Darryl: When did I get so fat? 
Andy: You look awesome. 
Darryl: I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here. 
Andy: Where are we in the process? 
Darryl: I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process. 
Andy: Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night? 
Darryl: The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement. 
Andy: You do have a fantastic basement. 
Darryl: I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point. 
Andy: Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go...there he is.
 
Andy: That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
 
Jim: OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad. 
Dwight: Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift] 
Jim: Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh! 
Kevin: Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.] 
Dwight: Yup.
 
Andy: Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off? 
Darryl: You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery? 
Female Applicant: Your old crew won the lottery? 
Andy: Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system? 

Male Applicant 1: Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit? 
Darryl: Oh yeah. 
Andy: Well- 
Darryl: One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly] 
Andy: Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing? 
Darryl: I don't 
Andy: You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so... 
Darryl: Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers. 
Andy: Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about. 
Darryl: OK. 
Andy: We need you, OK? 
Darryl:OK. 
Andy: OK? 
Darryl: Yeah. 
Andy: Alright.
 
Dwight: [Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses] 
Erin: I didn't feel anything.
 
Andy: Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor. 
Darryl: Why do you wanna work here? 
Male Applicant 1: I need a job. 
Darryl: That's not a good reason. 
Andy: Good. Keepin' 'em honest. 
Darryl: Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you’re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change. 
Andy: Are we scaring them straight....? 
Darryl: I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
 
Darryl: I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
 
Ryan: Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me? 
Pam: No. 
Ryan: Why not? What are you doing? 
Pam: Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs] 
Ryan: Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it. 
Pam: You came in at 10:30 today, right? 
Ryan: OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????
 
Andy: Is everyone licensed? 
Male Applicant 2: Like a driver's license? 
Andy: No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind. 
Female Applicant: Is this a joke? 
Andy: No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
 
Kevin: [On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back. 
Jim: There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids. 
Dwight: Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday. 
Jim: Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people. 
Dwight: [Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence. 
Jim: I'd go with that. 
Dwight: Like baboons or elephants. 
Jim: Not that, don't... 
Kevin: Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh. 
Jim: It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
Kevin: Yeah we move stuff and it was fun. 
Dwight: Kevin! Doesn't apply. 
Kevin: Right. My mom- 
Erin: [grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
 
Andy: Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um... 
Male Applicant 1: How much longer is this gonna take?
 
Darryl: Did you hire 'em? 
Andy: No. Because they all left. 
Darryl: What do you mean “they left”? 
Andy: I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn’t help. 
Darryl: Then I think you should fire me. 
Andy: What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you. 
Darryl: Yeah. Just put me out of my misery. 
Andy: …..OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke. 
Darryl: No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
 
Andy: So Darryl says to me “fire me”. But what he really means is “I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.” So I say “No, you're not fired.” But what I really mean is “I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.”........I really hope that's what he and I mean.
 
Andy: Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy. 
Oscar: Bulk or definition? 
Andy: Definition. 
Oscar: Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness. 
Andy: Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong? 
Oscar: Oh, he's plenty strong.
 
Oscar: It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
 
Pam: So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings.... 
Jim: Our fake winnings 
Pam: And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France. 
Jim: It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it. 
Pam: Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy. 
Jim: Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs] 
Dwight: Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again? 
Jim: A...hot chocolate tea
 
Andy: Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce? 
Gideon: North America...and, diminishing is a little reductive, but uh sure. That's the headline version. 
Andy: Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse. 
Gideon: FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule. 
Andy: Eh, cool. We'll figure that out. 
Nate: Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing. 
Andy: Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that? 
Bruce: Made it. 
Andy: So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
 
Dwight: Message in a Bottle, The Postman... 
Jim: Kevin Costner. 
Dwight: Kevin Costner. 
Jim: Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse] 
Kevin: So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea. 
Erin: You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
 
Jim: So, it's not the dumbest idea. 
Dwight: It's not the greatest one either... 
Jim: But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes. 
Dwight: And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor] 
Jim: So sadly, it's the best idea on the table. 
Dwight: Exactly. 
Kevin: I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim? 
Jim: Is he OK? 
Dwight: Yep. He'll be fine.
 
Andy: Surprise! Your new crew. 
Darryl: Would you just fire me, man? 
Andy: Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy? 
Darryl: You wanna make me happy? Huh? 
Andy: Yeah. 
Darryl: Give me your job. 
Andy: Haha, what? 
Darryl: I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me. 
Andy: I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that. 
Nate: Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises... 
Andy: Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that? 
Darryl: He died. 
Andy: He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it? 
Nate: What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a- 
Andy: None, no part of this has anything to do with you. 
Darryl: I didn't have time because of my daughter. 
Andy: Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class. 
Darryl: Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face. 
Andy: Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause] 
Darryl: OK. 
Andy: OK what? 
Darryl: OK, don't fire me. 
Andy: Ah, OK.
 
Darryl: My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
 
Darryl: I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch. 
Andy: Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright. 
Kevin: Here... 
Andy: What is goin' on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes] 
Kevin: Oh hey guys. 
Darryl: Why is the forklift in the wall? 
Andy: Why is the truck empty? 
Dwight: Uh, it's not totally empty. 
Darryl: Is that grease on my floor? 
Dwight: OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this. 
Darryl: And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease? 
Kevin: OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them. 
Jim: OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things. 
Darryl: And? 
Erin: And we did. 
Dwight: I don't know. 
Erin: Jim? Tell them what it's called. 
Jim: That's alright. 
Kevin: No Jim, tell 'em what a name is. 
Jim: Doesn't matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein, that's stupid. 
Kevin: [laughing] Señor Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim. 
Jim: That's OK, we're good. 
Erin: Jim... 
Andy: No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Señor Loadenstein. 
Jim: Porque es muy rapido. 
Dwight: OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away. 
Darryl: Let me see it. 
Dwight: It's uh, it's in beta testing. 
Darryl: Let me see it! 
Dwight: Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping. 
Dwight, Erin, Jim & Kevin: Uno! Dos! Tres! [Shot shows Jim & Dwight pulling ropes attached to a plank holding Erin in a helmet and boxes of paper down the greased runway, Dwight grunts]
 
Phyllis: Yeah, I lost my client.
 
Creed: I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
 
Toby: I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. [whispers] Flenderson files.
 
Pam: We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain. 
Jim: Right. It's city and country combined. 
Pam: Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world. 
Jim: And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want. 
Pam: Just like now. 
Jim: [laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible. 
Pam: Oh.. 
Jim: But what are you gonna do about that? 
Pam: What are you gonna do?

Jim: [entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard. 
Andy: Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?
 
Andy: What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
 
Andy: How'd it look? 
Jim: You've seen it, right? 
Andy: No. 
Pam: Andy, somebody defaced it. 
Andy: What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley.
 
Jim: There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
 
Andy: Erin, how long did we order those billboards for? 
Erin: Six months. 
Andy: Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company. 
Meredith: [entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it. 
Andy: Which one did you see? 
Meredith: Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it. 
Jim: Okay, don't be gross. 
Dwight: [entering office] What's going on? 
Pam: Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
Dwight: Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me? 
Andy: Yeah, Dwight. 
Dwight: No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
 
Dwight: Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far. 
Ryan: Just give us the address. We'll look it up online. 
Dwight: It's simpler this way. 
Oscar: It's really not. 
Andy: Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m. 
Kelly: I don't get the reason for this party. 
Phyllis: Yeah, what's the reason? 
Kelly: What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason? 
Andy: It's just a garden party. Sheesh.
 
Andy: You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
 
Andy: Few other super simple reminders – no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl? 
Darryl: What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time? 
Andy: I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up. 
Oscar: Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children. 
Phyllis: Yeah, it's just a picnic. 
Andy: This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party. 
Darryl: There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring. 
Andy: Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules. 
Pam: How is that better than a barbecue? 
Ryan: What's the dress code on this? 
Andy: I'm glad you asked – Connecticut Casual. 
Stanley: Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party. 
Andy: Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. [video playing on computer] 
Kevin: Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this. 
Darryl: I've seen this, that's not you. 
Meredith: Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage? 
Andy: It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time. 
Jim: Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party? 
Andy: Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group] 
Phyllis: Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
 
Gabe: I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?
 
Andy: See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time. 
Dwight: And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
 
Jim: [pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw] 
Dwight: They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by. 
Jim: Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea? 
Dwight: There's so much more to it than that.
 
Dwight: I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]
 
Jim: I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
 
Angela: Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles? 
Pam: Nope. 
Angela: I've already gone up another cup size. The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick? 
Pam: Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier. 
Angela: Phillip? 
Pam: Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather. 
Angela: Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat. 
Pam: [giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather. 
Angela: It's after my cat.
 
Robert: [on the phone] Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade. 
Andy: Ooh, that sounds great. 
Robert: Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade. 
Andy: Sure. 
Robert: You don't want to hear the other one. You love marmalade. 
Andy: Uh, I'll hear the other one. 
Robert: It's a basil plant. 
Andy: You know, the marmalade sounds great. 
Robert: I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested.
Andy: Then the basil will be fine. 
Robert: Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright. [hangs up]
 
Toby: Hey, where do I park? 
Mose: I'm the valet. You have to give me your car. 
Toby: Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself. 
Mose: I'm the... I'm the valet. You have to give me your car. 
Toby: It's probably okay... 
Mose: Give me your car. 
Toby: I think it's better that I... 
Mose: Give me your car. 
Toby: It's a finicky car... 
Mose: Get out. Have a good time at the thing. 
Toby: It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away]
 
Dwight: MR. RYAN HOWARD!
 
Jim: Chapter 2 – Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
 
Dwight: STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
 
Andy: How's it going over here, guys? 
Oscar: Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying. 
Andy: Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table. 
Oscar: Wow. 
Dwight: MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
 
Walter: So, you all work with Andy. 
Andy: Well, technically FOR Andy. 
Oscar: Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO. 
Ellen: I thought you were the CEO. 
Andy: I don't know how you got there. 
Walter: You said you were running the company. 
Andy: This branch, I'm the regional manager. 
Walter: Yes, that makes more sense. Are you all regional managers?
 
Andy: Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less.
 
Andy: Can I introduce you around now? 
Walter: Uh, yeah, we don't have too long, we have theater tickets. 
Andy: What are you going to see? 
Walter: Money Ball. Walter Jr.'s choice. 
Andy: What?? 
Walter Jr: Hey Bronard! 
Andy: I didn't know you were going to be here. 
Walter Jr: I wouldn't have missed it.
 
Erin: Ahh! [bird steals her hat]
 
Walter Jr: I'm Walter, Andy's younger brother. 
Jim: Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim. 
Walter Jr: Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam [looking at Meredith]. 
Jim: No. 
Meredith: Hell no. She wishes. 
Jim: No, no, no, no, no. No.
 
Waiter: Sir, I need to be able to feed all the guests. 
Kevin: [mouthful of food] I understand.
 
Dwight: Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself.
 
Jim: Chapter 4 – One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
 
Dwight: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA! 
Robert: Hello Andy. 
Andy: Welcome. 
Robert: Thank you. 
Andy: Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad. 
Robert: Yes, hello, nice to meet you. 
Walter: Pleasure. 
Robert: Andy, where shall I put your basil plant? 
Andy: Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade. 
Robert: No, I'm certain you said basil.
 
Ryan: This is not funny, man, let me down. 
Kevin: I think this thing is broken. 
Ryan: It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
 
Andy: So pretty today. 
Ellen: It's getting chilly. 
Walter: We really should be leaving. 
Andy: Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
 
Andy: Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
 
Andy: Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast? 
Darryl: Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
 
Gabe: I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
 
Angela: I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton! 
Pam: I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
 
Angela: She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
 
Ryan: I'd like to make a toast to the troops. All the troops. Both sides. 
Erin: I think we should toast...
 
Dwight: Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
 
Jim: Chapter 9 – The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
 
Kevin: Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California. 
Gabe: I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,... 
Andy: You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once. 
Robert: I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy. 
Andy: Yeah, yeah. 
Robert: You people say I led you, but it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us. I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers. 
Gabe: To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you... 
Andy: Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage! 
Walter: I'm eating, Andy. 
Andy: Ah, come on! 
Walter: Okay. Okay. 
Andy: Yes! 
Walter: What do you want to do? 
Andy: Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar] 
Walter: Oh, whoa, sure? Really? It's a little tricky. 
Andy: [singing] Saying I love you is not the words... 
Walter: It's too high. 
Andy: Yeah? 
Walter: It's high but it's not that high. 
Andy: Right, it feels strange. 
Walter: Just take it down a little. 
Andy: Saying I love... Saying I love you... 
Walter: Here, give it to me. Okay. Uh, something like... [singing] Saying I love you is... 
Andy & Walter: ...not the words... 
Walter: You don't come in yet. [singing] ...I want to hear from you, It's not that I want you... 
Andy & Walter: ...not to say it but if you only knew... More than words is all you have to do to make it real... 
Andy: Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin! 
Erin: [holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling. 
Andy & Walter: What would you do if my heart was torn in two... 
Walter: You know what, Walter Jr. is here. Why don't you come up and join us?
Walter Jr: Dad, no. I'm just having a good time getting to know Andy's friends here. 
Meredith: Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo! 
Walter & Walter Jr: [singing] May the good lord be with you down every road you roam. And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home. And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true. And do unto others as you'd have done to you... 
Andy: [applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar. 
Erin's Cell Phone: If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. 
Erin: Sorry.
 
Kelly: I am so cold. 
Ryan: That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
 
Dwight: My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer? 
Robert: Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here. 
Dwight: Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking? 
Robert: Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me? 
Dwight: I can get you exotic meats – hippo steaks, giraffe burgers... 
Robert: We'll talk. [walks away] 
Dwight: It'll all be goat.
 
Andy: Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call. 
Walter: [knocks] Hi. What was that display? 
Andy: I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me. 
Walter: Andrew... 
Andy: I know, I know that you're proud of me. 
Walter: I'm not going to tell you how impressed I am that you're a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You're a grown man, don't act like a little boy who needs...
 
Darryl: I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too. 
Oscar: Guess we found Andy's rosebud. 
Darryl: Rosebud? 
Oscar: It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are. 
Darryl: I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed. 
Oscar: Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree. 
Darryl: No. You're wrong.
 
Robert: Are you sure? 
Ryan: Yeah! I'm too hot anyway. 
Robert: My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you.
 
Walter: It was a nice party, the setting was a little strange. Uh, the food... 
Ellen: Sandwiches were dry. 
Walter Jr: Bye Tuna, bye Pam!
 
Andy: Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
Darryl: Cheeseburger or hamburger. 
Andy: Um, cheeseburger. 
Oscar: Narddog. [throws Andy a can] 
Andy: Thanks, Oscar.
 
Pam: What are they doing? 
Jim: Closing ceremonies. 
Pam: Nice touch.
 
Jim: I think I left my wallet in your house. 
Dwight: Who cares. 
Jim: Right here. 
Dwight: MR. JAMES HALPERT! 
Jim: Keys, keys... 
Dwight: Stop forgetting things. 
Jim: I didn't forget them, they're right here. 
Dwight: MR. JAMES HALPERT! 
Jim: I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing... 
Dwight: What? Idiot. 
Jim: Whoo. 
Dwight: MIS... MI... What are you doing? 
Jim: Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office? 
Dwight: That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
 
Deleted Scene 1
 
Oscar: I cannot believe how condescending Andy's being. 
Darryl: He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with. 
Meredith: Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer! 
Andy: Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit? 
Ryan: Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
Andy: Awesome.
 
Dwight: Erin....the receptionist! 
Andy: Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark? 
Kevin: What? 
Andy: With Hors d'oeuvres we only take one at a time. 
Kevin: Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
 
Jim: Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests. 
Dwight: When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
 
Dwight: Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]
 
Angela: Little Cici asleep? 
Pam: Yeah, she just went down. 
Angela: Such a precious little angel. 
Pam: Aww. 
Angela: Cecilia....and Phillip. 
Pam: Yes, after my grandfather. 
Angela: Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole! 
Pam: Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that. 
Angela: You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early. 
Pam: You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months? 
Angela: Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
 
Andy: My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other?


Andy: [looking at Angela's costume] Approved!
 
Andy: [claps] Chef from South Park, it's genius! 
Stanley: Just some chef.
 
Andy: I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.
 
Kevin: The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life. 
Andy: Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert. 
Kevin: It's been out for ages, man. 
Andy: Costume vetoed.
 
Andy: Ah, it's, uh... somebody's already called that. 
Phyllis: Who? 
Andy: Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
 
Kelly: This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's? 
Andy: Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just... 
Kelly: Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here. 
Meredith: Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing! 
Andy: I thought you were at your sister's funeral. 
Meredith: What I said was, “My sister's funeral is this weekend.” Didn't say I'd be there.
 
Meredith: Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
 
Andy: Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through? 
Erin: Here you go. 
Andy: There you go. Thank you.
 
Erin: When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
 
Kevin: Jim, put it on. 
Darryl: Put it on, man. 
Jim: I don't know if I can. 
Kevin: Come on, the Three Amigos. 
Darryl: Three Kings. 
Jim: Alright.
 
Jim: I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
 
Ryan: [to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really... 
Kelly: [Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you? 
Dwight: It's called a costume. 
Kelly: What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman? 
Dwight: Ryan, will you please tell her who I am? 
Ryan: Whoopi Goldberg. 
Dwight: Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
 
Toby: Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
 
Andy: Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
 
Andy: I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - "Boo!" Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - "Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high." Scared the s**t out of me.
 
Andy: G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me? 
Pam: Yeah. 
Andy: Australian accent...
 
Pam: [faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing? 
Erin: Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't. 
Pam: Oh. [sends fax, Erin nods] Are you... 
Erin: That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right? 
Pam: Oh, Erin... 
Erin: Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3? 
Pam: Um, 2? 
Erin: That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear. 
Pam: No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right? 
Erin: Yeah... 
Pam: Yeah. 
Erin: Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
 
Phyllis: Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour. 
Oscar: I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing. 
Pam: Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello. 
Oscar: [sigh] What happened, Pam? 
Pam: Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story... 
Phyllis: Wait, they have food there? 
Pam: ...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
 
Jim: No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
 
Jim: Hey. 
Pam: Hey! 
Jim: Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about? 
Pam: What do you mean? 
Jim: Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was? 
Pam: I saw a ghost. 
Jim: Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was? 
Pam: It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date. 
Jim: Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it. 
Pam: I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
 
Andy: Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack! 
Robert: Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer. 
Andy: Yes. 
Robert: Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is... a paper company. 
[everyone greets Bert] 
Bert: Hello. Can I use a computer? I need to check a hurricane. 
Robert: Here, use this one. [walking to Jim's desk] 
[Jim shakes his head "no", Andy motions to him to "shh"] 
Robert: Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son? 
Erin: Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game? 
Bert: That stuff's for babies. 
Robert: Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us. 
Andy: Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.
 
Robert: [laughing] Extraordinary. Did you plan this? 
Kelly: Well, Toby and I did, yeah. 
Gabe: And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do. 
Toby: If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance. 
Kelly: 1, 2, 3! 
Gabe/Kelly/Toby: [singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew. 
Robert: [laughing and clapping] Delightful. 
Kelly: Thank you. [Gabe mumbles] 
Robert: Now then, how are we today? 
Kelly: Fine. 
Toby: Great. 
Robert: Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright? 
Kelly: Mmhmm. 
Robert: You feeling fulfilled in your life? 
Kelly: I guess. 
Robert: You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have. 
Kelly: I try not to think about it. 
Robert: Because it's too terrifying to imagine. Now we're cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours? 
Kelly: Never marrying. 
Robert: Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby? 
Toby: So great.
 
[Angela takes the pumpking decoration off of the window] 
Erin: Oh, I put those up. 
Angela: I know. I'm taking them down. 
Phyllis: I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y. 
Erin: I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so... 
Angela: Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it? 
Erin: Oh. 
Angela: So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
 
Bert: Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm. 
Dwight: Yeah, perfectly mediocre. 
Bert: What are you, anyway? 
Dwight: I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul. 
Bert: If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft. 
Dwight: Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored. 
Bert: If you're going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl. 
Dwight: Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm! 
Bert: Yeah, she also has boobs. 
Dwight: Yeah, but no nipples.
 
Erin: Hey. 
Andy: Hey. What's up? 
Erin: November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month! 
Andy: Yeah... 
Erin: Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know? 
Andy: Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG. 
Erin: But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I? 
Andy: Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
Erin: Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can. 
Andy: [pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don't know. Mmhmm.
 
Erin: Gabe? 
Gabe: Sweetheart. 
Erin: I’m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz. 
Gabe: Ok where does Gabe factor in? 
Erin: Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn’t stop crying? 
Gabe: Yes. Lars and Decocco’s 
Erin: Ok. Let’s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one. Just… more adult… more… scary and sexy 
Gabe: I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine. 
Erin: No – just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff. 
Gabe: [laughs, eventually Erin joins him laughing] Oh that would be scary! 
Erin: What are you thinking? 
Gabe: Ok let me go get it.
 
Pam: [answers phone] Pam Halpert. 
Jim: Hey it’s Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I’ve read a lot about this really great documentary. 
Pam: Is it called Ghostbusters? 
Jim: [laughs] It’s called Ghostbusters. 
Pam: It didn’t look like that. 
Jim: It didn’t have a buster sign around him? Why don’t you draw him? Why don’t we see this whole thing. 
Pam: Ok fine I’ll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws] 
Jim: I ain’t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa! 
Pam: Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick? 
Dwight: It’s a root you idiot. 
Bert: Everyone hates you. 
Dwight: That’s really rude. I don’t tell you hurricanes suck even though it’s true.
Bert: What do you like? Tornadoes? 
Dwight: Try influenza. 
Bert: Oh yeah? What’s the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane? 
Dwight: Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane’s coming. I suppose you’re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark? 
Bert: Try a box jelly fish.
 
Jim: You know that’s… 
Robert: What are we talking about? 
Jim: I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too. 
Robert: [to Kevin] You seem unimpressed. Ghosts don’t scare you? 
Kevin: I’m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that don’t exist like ghosts or mummies. 
Oscar: Mummies are real. There are mummies at museums. 
Kevin: Yeah [nervously]…prank 
Robert: It’s true. They’ve been preserved for thousands of years. They’re all over.
 
Kevin: [screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
 
Erin: Witch’s brew?
 
Erin: I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh!
 
Jim: Party looks fun doesn’t it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
Bert: I’m using it. I’m about to play Starcraft with him [points to Dwight]. 
Jim: [to Dwight] Are you serious? 
Dwight: Yeah I’m serious. 
Jim: That’s funny. Ok. 
Dwight: Loser. 
Bert: Yeah.
 
Angela: Pam do you think anyone’s going to notice I’ve worn this costume before? When I wasn’t pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
 
Oscar: Hey guys. I’m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying “Representative Weiner] weiner. 
Ryan: Oh my god!
 
Darryl: This party’s tight. The fog is cool. 
Erin: Thanks. It’s on medium. 
Darryl: Perfect. 
Andy: It really looks great. You did a great job. 
Erin: Oh, so we don’t have to have that talk. 
Andy: We should still have that talk. Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.
 
Erin: [in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok. [hits play on DVD player, “Do yes disturb meditations of horror” appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]
 
Gabe: The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement. The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
 
Oscar: [cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother? 
Andy: What’s the story? 
Oscar: There is no story. 
Gabe: Yeah it seems like there isn’t a narrative. [on screen a man gets into a car] Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting. 
Stanley: What the hell is going on here? 
Andy: I think we’ve seen enough. You can turn it off now. [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now. 
Stanley: How did you get in my car? 
Oscar: Where is this from? That is so upsetting! 
Andy: That was awful. Robert I apologize. 
Erin: I’m sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now [grabs box]. This game is called “pecker Poker”. [fighting tears] It’s the game of cards that gets you hard.
 
Andy: What we have here is a classic misunderstanding. 
Robert: Why didn’t you simply ask Andy to clarify? Asking is a very easy thing to do. You’re obviously very close. [Andy and Erin look awkwardly at each other and Robert]. Oh I see. This no longer seems like my business [Robert sits]. 
Erin: All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so… 
Robert: You were going to talk at the end of the… I’m not here. 
Andy: Did you think I was going to fire you? No I wasn’t. [to Robert] I’m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you. 
Robert: I’m never uncomfortable. 
Andy: Ok. Erin I think you know I’ve been dating someone. 
Erin: Sure. 
Andy: And it’s getting a little more serious. She’s never come by. 
Erin: And she’s never called here. Unless it’s your mom. 
Andy: No I didn’t want her to call because I thought it would be weird. But now it’s weird that she’s not calling. 
Erin: Two dates? Three dates? 
Andy: Thirty-one. 
Erin: Wow. I’m so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. I’ll see you guys. 
Robert: I should go.
 
Darryl: I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person. 
Jim: [whispering] Thank you. 
Pam: Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical? 
Jim: Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win. 
Pam: Really. 
Jim: No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not... 
Kevin: Exactly. 
Jim: Thank you.
 
Dwight: Go, get up there right now. 
Bert: Got it. 
Darryl: Dwight? 
Dwight: You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B. 
Bert: Unleash the hellstorm. 
Darryl: Dwight. 
Dwight: [laughs] Nice. 
Darryl: Dwight! 
Dwight: Got 'em. Go!
 
Phyllis: Is she Asian? 
Erin: I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest. 
Phyllis: Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest? 
Erin: I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city. 
Phyllis: Hmm.
 
Robert: Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed? 
Creed: No... 
Robert: Are you scared of snakes? 
Creed: You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
 
Darryl: [in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
 
Meredith: [talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
 
Robert: [to camera] What am I up to?
 
Jim: Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, "Mom, there's a ghost in my closet." Now, you say one of two things - one, "You're just having a bad dream," or two, "Let's go see what it was." 
Pam: I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim. 
Jim: Ok. 
Pam: I'm not gonna lie to her, either. 
Jim: Oh, come on! 
Robert: When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. [hisses] She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter. 
Creed: Oh my goodness. 
Robert: The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies. 
Kevin: Nooo! 
Robert: Amongst them was a man, tall, slim. 
Meredith: Jim. [rolls eyes] 
Robert: Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. "Oh, wait," she thought, "I don't have a husband." For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, "Baby, are you okay?" Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, "I'm fine, b!tch, I'm fine." 
Bert: [laughs]
 
Robert: Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us. How dare we let it into our decision making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships. It's funny, isn't it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.
 

Bert: Toby? 
Toby: Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry... 
Bert: You're fired. 
Toby: ...bones. What? 
Bert: You heard me. Pack your things. 
Toby: What... you can't... Gabe? Are you... 
Bert: I'm the CEO's son. Pack your things. You're done.

Andy: [Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic] 
Erin: [Laughs and shrieks] 
Andy: Closing time.
 
Andy: Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over. Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day. It's weird.
 
Andy: Closing time 
Jim: [On phone] ...W R K. 
Andy: One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer. 
Jim: Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten. Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing. 
Andy: Come on pam! 
Andy/Pam: [Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
 
Pam: Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
 
Andy: I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. [Pulls towel through legs] I know who I want to take me home. [Spins Meredith in chair] Take me hooo…hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing… no traditions! 
Stanley: [singing] Closing time every new beginning…
 
Stanley: I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now…it's my favorite song.
 
Andy/Stanley: [singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end. 
Stanley: Goodnight.
 
Andy: Whose your favorite iron chef? 
Robert: [speaking at the same time as andy] This is atrocious. 
Andy: You go first. 
Robert: The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error prone office. 
Andy: Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes… 
Dwight: [runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead. 
Robert: [to dwight] Did you need something from us? 
Dwight: Wha…Yes. Your attention. Uh because… No that is all. [walks out]
 
Dwight: Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted "We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
 
Robert: Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free. 
Andy: Umpf…that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there. 
Robert: Who are they? 
Andy: They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture… 
Robert: Andrew sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all. 
Andy: I would agree with that. 
Robert: Simply…end the mistakes 
Andy: End the mistakes, easy- 
Robert: When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn't that be nice? 
Andy: I would like that. 
Robert: End the mistakes. That is all I ask. [gets up from chair] And you can't have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all.
 
Jim: I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So…my pitch is…me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine. 
Darryl: Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine. 
Jim: Is that off again? 
Darryl: Oh yeah. 
Jim: Ok. 
Val: Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today. 
Darryl: Ahh…We don't really do those. We just sign the thing. 
Val: Are you really this lazy? 
Darryl: I'll be there.
 
Gabe: Hey. 
Val: Hey. 
Gabe: Monday's suck. 
Val: Yeaha…yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.
 
Dwight: I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it. 
Andy: What do you got? 
Dwight: [opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh…should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work. 
Andy: Sounds controversial. 
Dwight: Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two? 
Andy: Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop. 
Dwight: Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead. 
Andy: Go do the voodoo that you do so well. 
Dwight: I will do my voodoo. 
Andy: Mmhmmm.
 
Gabe: Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship. 
Toby: For you? 
Gabe: Yes. For Gabe. 
Toby: Who are you seeing? That's gr… 
Gabe: Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse. 
Toby: Oh. 
Gabe: I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist] 
Toby: You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating. 
Gabe: Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know? 
Toby: But I mean…uh have you talked to her? Is sh… 
Gabe: Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays… 
Toby: Do you know her last name, yet? 
Gabe: Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight. 
Toby: She's going to be screaming her own last name? 
Gabe: Hey! Watch it. 
Toby: Good luck Gabe.
 
Andy: Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really. 
Kevin: Thank you. 
Andy: And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call…Dwight… 
Dwight: The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out. 
Andy: If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper. 
Dwight: Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him. 
Kelly: What emails are you talking about? 
Dwight: Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly. 
Kelly: That's not that bad actually. 
Dwight: P.S. We should should kill him. 
Jim: Wait, so you installed a doomsday device? 
Dwight: No, it's an accountability booster. 
Jim: Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device. 
Dwight: Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task. 
Kelly: Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives. 
Ryan: We can't do this Dwight. 
Dwight: [Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile…nod. Smile and nod.
 
Dwight: They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like…not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor…
 
Andy: Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes. 
Dwight: But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
 
Andy: Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha. 
Stanley: This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me. 
Oscar: There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment. 
Dwight: [alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake. 
Erin: Now we only have four strikes left until a home run. 
Andy: Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I… 
Dwight: It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.
 
Warehouse Crew: First. Second. 
Darryl: It's not a race. 
Warehouse Crew: Thirrrr….third. 
Darryl: Who knows what the belt is for? 
Gabe: It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous. 
Darryl: Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone. 
Warehouse Crew: Hi, gabe. 
Darryl: All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays. 
Gabe: Look at this, this is enormous.
 
Gabe: I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow]
 
Gabe: It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way. 
Darryl: You done? 
Gabe: The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.
 
Phyllis: Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five. 
Kevin: I'm on it. 
Angela: Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project. 
Kevin: Good thinking.
 
Kevin: Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
 
Angela: Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head]
 
Oscar: When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
 
Andy: Alright everybody, you are doing great! 
Dwight: Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger] 
Jim: Dwight, question. 
Dwight: No questions. 
Jim: If this doomsday device goes off... 
Dwight: Accountability booster. 
Jim: If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that? 
Dwight: I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
 
Stanley: Try mose1234. 
Ryan: Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like…z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that. 
Jim: Ok. 
Dwight: How about Scrantonstrangler666. 
Jim: Nope. 
Dwight: No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha…You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike. 
Kelly: Wha…what's Dwight's mothers name. 
Jim: Hmm…Heda. [alert] No.
 
Darryl: Once you read the packet, sign the back. 
Gabe: Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val… 
Darryl: Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back. 
Val: Yeah, sure. 
Gabe: Uh. 
Darryl: Mmhmm. [points at gabe] Caramel soy latte. 
Gabe: Decaf frap- 
Darryl: Got it.
 
Angela: You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right? 
Oscar: Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty. 
Angela: Six-seventy, six-twenty. 
Oscar: Nuh uh. 
Angela: yes! 
Oscar: Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no. 
Kevin: What does this mean? What does it mean! 
Oscar: Andy. [alert sounds] 
Angela: Ohhhh! 
Andy: Gahhh. That's five strikes. 
Stanley: [pulls out Brandy bottle] Well…I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today. 
Andy: Dwight we got five strikes. 
Dwight: Really? 
Andy: Did the email go out or… 
Dwight: It goes out automatically at five P.M. 
Andy: Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it. 
Dwight: Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it. 
Andy: Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password. 
Dwight: No. 
Andy: What?! 
Dwight: You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day. 
Phyllis: We did our best. 
Dwight: No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?! 
Erin: You're a real crumb bum, you know that? 
Dwight: Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from? 
Kevin: Uh, the man tree puts its penis- 
Dwight: Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please. 
Andy: Nn no. 
Dwight: What? 
Andy: No! 
Oscar: Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine. 
Kelly: Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down! 
Dwight: Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
 
Erin: Dwight's car is gone. 
Pam: I bet he went home. 
Andy: Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email. 
Andy: Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us. 
Kevin: Yeah. 
Andy: Kevin has that lovability. 
Kevin: Guys come on. I'm right here. 
Andy: Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something. 
Jim: Ok, where is he? 
Erin: Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash. 
Jim: I'll try both.
 
Dwight: [digging] Oh. Come to reason with me? 
Andy: Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you- 
Dwight: Get lost. 
Andy: Well now hold on it, it- 
Pam: What are you doing? 
Dwight: What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse. 
Pam: Uhm. 
Erin: Do you need a hand? 
Pam: Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in] 
Dwight: If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
 
Robert: I'll see you next week Will. [at the club, playing squash] 
Jim: Robert. 
Robert: Jim what are you…What a surprise. 
Jim: Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting. 
Robert: Yeah. 
Jim: You up for a game? 
Robert: A game or a match? 
Jim: Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.
 
Pam: Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down] 
Andy: [to Dwight] Where you going? 
Dwight: In. I'm hungry. 
Pam: Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water. 
Dwight: Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on. 
Pam: Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is. 
Dwight: This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
 
Val: That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab. 
Darryl: Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab? 
Val: That's what I'm sayin'. 
Gabe: [to Val] Hey. You're welcome. 
Val: Thanks for the coffee. 
Gabe: So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me. 
Val: Are you asking me on a date? 
Gabe: Yes, I am. 
Val: Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy. 
Gabe: I could quit. Problem solved. 
Val: Don't quit. [Darryl eavesdropping, nods]
 
Darryl: Good policy. Sensible. Smart.
 
Jim: Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving. 
Robert: In the box. 
Jim: In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
 
Oscar: Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left. 
Angela: Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'- 
Oscar: I made a mistake. I'm sorry. 
Stanley: I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy] 
Oscar: It's not that funny.
 
Erin: [Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt. 
Pam: Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right? 
Dwight: Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's "Nobody's perfect." Nice stroke, Pam. 
Pam: No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha. 
Dwight: I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny. 
Andy: Dwight, there's just a small matter of a- 
Pam: You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk. 
Dwight: Any specific animal? 
Pam: I'm thinking cow- 
Dwight: Don't say cow- Ugh. 
Andy: What are you doing? It's 5 to 5. 
Pam: Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will. 
Andy: That's insane! 
Pam: Just trust me. 
Andy: Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning. 
Pam: I got this. 
Andy: Enngh-
 
Pam: Hahhh, thanks for everything. 
Dwight: Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling] 
Kevin: Isn't it supposed to be, "Drive safely"?
 
Jim: [a text tone goes off] Is that my phone? 
Robert: Sounded like mine. 
Jim: Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright. 
Robert: Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag. 
Jim: Oh, oh yeah. 
Robert: Can I have it? 
Jim: Yes. Right now? Yes. 
Robert: Yep. 
Jim: Here you go. [throws it over glass] 
Robert: Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa. [tries to catch it with racket, misses, lands on floor] 
Robert: [censored beep] ha, Jesus. 
Jim: Awww, sorry. Did it break? 
Robert: Nah, it's good. 
Jim: You sure? 
Robert: Yeah. 
Jim: What kinda iPhone is that? 
Robert: It's the standard one. The one everyone has. 
Jim: Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting? 
Robert: It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting? 
Jim: Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone] 
Robert: My serve!
 
Pam: [her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device! 
Andy: Oh! 
Kevin: Yes! 
Erin: Haho!
 
Oscar: [his phone vibrates] He stopped it! 
Ryan: Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
 
Dwight: They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
 
Robert: Take it easy. Nice and easy. 
Jim: [hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down] 
Robert: Oo! 
Jim: I'm alright. 
Robert: You alright? 
Jim: Yep. 
Robert: Skinned knee. 
Jim: Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow] 
Robert: Oo, a little ice on that maybe. 
Jim: Yeah. That does not feel good. 
Robert: Okay. My serve.

Andy: Erin. 
Erin: Yeah. 
Andy: In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I’m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me. 
Erin: Who’s calling? 
Andy: Nobody. Just say that I'm- Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I’m going to refuse to take it. 
Erin: You’re not going to take it? 
Andy: Just make up a phone call. It’s not a real call. Make it up. 
Erin: Ohohohoh. 
Andy: And come and tell me. Doesn’t matter what it is. 
Erin: You’re not going to get it though? 
Andy: I’m not going to take it. And then he’s going to be like “whoa this is a really important meeting”. 
Erin: Copy that. 
Andy: Okay.
 
Andy: Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I’ll tell you how we can beat it. 
Client: Uh well we’ve been going with… 
Erin: Andy. 
Andy: Yeah. 
Erin: You have a very important call. 
Andy: I’m sorry – I’m with a very important client. It’ll have to wait. 
Erin: Are you sure? It’s really, really important. 
Andy: There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting. 
Erin: Really? Because your mother is dead. 
Client: Oh my God. 
Andy: I don’t think she’s dead. 
Erin: She’s dead. She was hit by a bus. 
Andy: She’s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls. 
Erin: This isn’t one of those times. It’s the police. They said it’s the worst they’ve ever seen. 
Dwight: Andy I’m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences. 
Client: Oh you must take this call. It's… 
Andy: Yeah. Um line 1? 
Erin: Line 2. 
Andy: Hi. 
Darryl:[on phone]It’s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died. 
Andy: Ooh, gosh! 
Darryl: Dude. 
Andy: Officer. 
Darryl: Look man this is a bad idea. 
Andy: Did she have any last words or? 
Darryl: Really? That is messed up man. 
Andy: Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible. 
Darryl: You’re a bad man Andy Bernard. 
Andy: That is so mom. 
Darryl: That stuff can come back to get you. It’s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle… 
Andy: Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
 
Pam: Hey Cathy. 
Cathy: Hi. 
Pam: How’s it going? Everything make sense? 
Cathy: I think everything is under control. 
Pam: Great. 
Cathy: You should sit down. 
Pam: Oh no, I’m fine. 
Cathy: No I should go fill out my paperwork. 
Pam: Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this. 
Dwight: Oh we know.
 
Pam: I’m training a temp to be my replacement while I’m on maternity leave. Oh I should’ve mentioned I’m pregnant. You probably didn’t notice because it’s impossible to tell I’m so small. But yeah I’m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!
 
Ryan: Hey – asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single? 
Jim: Hmm. Doubt it. 
Ryan: Yeah me too. 
Pam: You doubt it? 
Jim: What’s that? 
Pam: Why do you doubt that she’s single? 
Jim: Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we’d save her from Ryan right?
 
Darryl: What are you doing with my lunch? 
Andy: I’m delivering it from the fridge. It’s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza? 
Darryl: It’s not pizza. 
Andy: Yeah and we’re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you’d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes. 
Darryl: I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in? 
Andy: Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs]
 
Ryan: So word on the street is she has a boyfriend. 
Gabe: Well he’s probably a drug dealer. That’s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow. 
Toby: It’s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office. 
Oscar: Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence. 
Offscreen: Good energy 
Pam: It’s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam’s desk huh? 
Oscar: No, no. Not even. 
Pam: I’m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She’s obviously super cute I get it. But I’d like to point out there’s 50 pounds more of me to love if that’s your thing. 
Oscar: Pam you look more beautiful now than ever. 
Toby: Radiant. 
Pam: Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet. 
Phyllis: Yeah you have this sexy glow. 
Gabe: It’s one of the most common fetishes. 
Pam: Really well thank you all. 
Toby: You know it’s not just pregnant women who don’t get their due. You know who’s gorgeous? Helen Mirren. 
Ryan: Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing? 
Toby: You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It’s a pregnant Helen Mirren. 
[everyone agrees] 
Dwight: Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you’re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman. 
Oscar: In this case yes. 
Dwight: No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman. 
Phyllis: No we’re not. 
Dwight: Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That’s right. You’re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
 
Andy: [scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray. 
Darryl: Nice scatting, man. 
Andy: Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point. 
Val: Not bad fellas, you're better than you look. 
Kevin: Hey, screw you! 
Andy: [sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early? 
Robert: Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here? 
Andy: Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes. 
Robert: You're a band. 
Andy: Thank you. 
Kevin: We're called Kevin and the Zits. 
Darryl: That was never agreed upon. 
Robert: I miss being in a band. 
Andy: Miss no more! What do you play? Join us! 
Kevin: I have a tambourine. 
Robert: Tambourine? You know I’m the CEO, right? 
Andy: [to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends. 
Robert: I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car. 
Andy: Great! 
Kevin: Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit! 
Darryl: Again, never agreed upon.
 
Andy: I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life! 
Darryl: Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right? 
Andy: Yeah, even cooler. 
Kevin: We all got to go sometime.
 
Pam: Hey. 
Jim: Hey. 
Pam: Helen Mirren. Hot? 
Jim: Yeah. Super pretty. 
Pam: Huh. What about Cathy? 
Jim: The temp? 
Pam: Yeah. Do you think she's hot? 
Jim: Nope. 
Pam: I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive? 
Jim: And I'm telling you, I don't. 
Pam: You don't find Cathy attractive? 
Jim: No, I don't.
 
Jim: No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I’m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
 
Pam: Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake. 
Jim: Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves] 
Dwight: That's just absurd. 
Pam: Yes, because she's hot, right? 
Dwight: Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
 
Pam: The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.
 
Pam: Dwight, am I hot right now? 
Dwight: Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction. 
Pam: What about before? Was I attractive before? 
Dwight: Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low. 
Pam: Hmm. I think Jim’s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy. 
Dwight: You think Jim’s lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying. 
Pam: Five bucks if you can get him to admit it. 
Dwight: Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman. 
Pam: Yep, that's the Dwight I need. 
Dwight: If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules. 
Pam: Okay. 
Dwight: Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth. 
Pam: I think so. Okay. 
Dwight: Rule two: we stop at nothing. 
Pam: Well, what does that... is that... okay. 
Dwight: Rule three: Don't fall in love. 
Pam: Yep, good.
 
Dwight: We're gonna bust this guy. 
Pam: Honesty is very important to me. 
Dwight: So important. And then we will destroy the man himself. 
Pam: Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
 
Kelly: Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam. 
Dwight: None taken. What do you got? 
Kelly: It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot. 
Pam: Hmm.
 
Robert: [to the keyboardist, Curtis, and the drummer] Hey, you found us! 
Curtis: You guys sound great, man. 
Robert: Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding. 
Darryl: Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead. 
Kevin: [to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You’re the sportscaster on channel seven. 
Drummer: Go Eagles! [laughs] 
Kevin: You do that on TV! 
Robert: You guys mind if they join us? 
Andy: Yeah, absolutely! 
Kevin: Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and güiro] 
Darryl: Hey, why don't you and me play those? 
Kevin: Yeah? Okay, this is awesome. 
Robert: What should we play? 
Kevin: Maybe we should warm up with some scales? 
Robert: Midnight Rambler? 
Curtis: Yeah. 
Andy: Midnight what? 
Curtis: [singing] Have you heard about the midnight rambler? [Lisa, the guitarist, enters] Hey, come on in, baby. Yeah!
 
Pam: Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single. 
Jim: Oh, I stand corrected. 
Pam: I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas? 
Jim: Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets. 
Pam: Mike Tibbets, really? 
Jim: Mm-hmm. 
Ryan: Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive? 
Jim: Not his mom's car. 
Ryan: Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z. 
Jim: Touche?
 
Kelly: [sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww! 
Pam: Kelly, calm down. 
Kelly: I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs. 
Pam: I don't think Jim cares about his hair. 
Kelly: Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person. 
Dwight: I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer. 
Pam: Jim's on to me. 
Dwight: Hmm? 
Pam: Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it. 
Dwight: Just ugly enough to have deniability. 
Pam: Yep.
 
Jim: Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
 
Dwight: Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body. 
Kelly: I'm gonna write something mean on his wall. 
Pam: No, Kelly, don't. 
Dwight: The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there. 
Pam and Kelly: With the crotch? 
Dwight: With the crotch.
 
Kevin: [music plays] Whoo!
 
Dwight: Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed] 
Creed: Who said that? 
Dwight: Exactly. 
Creed: How'd I get this long triangle? 
Dwight: Okay, just shut it. 
Pam: Is he puffing out his chest? 
Dwight: I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that? 
Pam: No. Maybe he just said something funny. 
Dwight: Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that. 
Pam: I think he's just making her laugh. 
Dwight: Time for me to find out. 
Pam: Why's he making her laugh so much? 
Dwight: Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch] 
Jim: Dwight! 
Cathy: Are you okay? 
Dwight: I'm fine, I'm totally fine. 
Jim: Dwight! Dwight! 
Dwight: Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim. 
Jim: [to Cathy] Sorry about that. 
Dwight: Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again] 
Jim: Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why? 
Dwight: I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance. 
Jim: Leave. 
Dwight: [to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
 
Pam: Why was he making her laugh so much?
 
Pam: Oh, hey, I'll just be a second. 
Cathy: Yeah, take your time. 
Pam: Okay. 
Cathy: [to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander? 
Jim: Mm-hmm? 
Cathy: It was from a deleted scene so we were both right. 
Jim: [laughs] Told you. 
Cathy: Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or- 
Pam: Oscar, Cathy has a question! 
Cathy: Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar. 
Pam: [to Jim] Yeah? 
Jim: You okay? 
Pam: Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it. 
Jim: Okay, what can I do to make you believe me? 
Pam: Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.
 
Dwight: She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
 
Pam: Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.
 
Dwight: And she called it nuts?
 
Darryl: Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going. 
Kevin: Mm-hmm. 
Andy: Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan? 
Kevin: Are you serious? From Star Trek? 
Darryl: [to Val] Hey, you caught some of that? 
Val: I caught it. 
Darryl: What, you don't like the blues? 
Val: I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues. 
Andy: Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts] 
Val: I think the music left without you.
 
Dwight: Come on. 
Jim: Stop shoving me. 
Dwight: [mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs. 
Jim: [to Pam] Really? 
Pam: This could all go away if you just tell me the truth. 
Old Man: Uh, are you all in line? 
Dwight: Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert? 
Jim: Si. 
Pam: Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him? 
Dwight: We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
Old Man: You have to share the machine with others. 
Dwight: [mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten. 
Jim: Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first. 
Old Man: Thank you. 
Dwight: Jim, are you serious? 
Jim: Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
 
Andy: Maybe we could switch instruments. 
Kevin: Yeah. 
Andy: 'Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised. 
Darryl: Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
 
Andy: We had to leave because of creative differences. 
Darryl: Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing. 
Kevin: Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now. 
Darryl: No man, we are. 
Andy: Well- 
Darryl: No, no, no.
 
Dwight: [to old man] Okay, you're done. 
Old Man: I have a new heart, you know. 
Dwight: Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
 
Jim: No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
 
Dwight: Do you find Cathy Simms attractive? 
Jim: No. 
Dwight: Yep, he's lying. 
Pam: Ah, see, was that so hard? 
Jim: I am not lying. 
Pam: Really? 
Jim: Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test? 
Dwight: I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really? 
Pam: Wait, what? 
Dwight: Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar. 
Pam: Jim, you have high blood pressure. 
Dwight: Oh, he is definitely attracted to her. 
Pam: Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure? 
Jim: Yeah, but I don't smoke. 
Pam: When was the last time you went to the doctor? 
Jim: I don't know. 
Dwight: It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it- 
Pam: Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you? 
Jim: Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul. 
Dwight: It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man. 
Jim: Okay. 
Pam: Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor. 
Dwight: Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name? 
Pam: Just go home. It doesn't matter. 
Dwight: But... hey, Cece's toothbrush. 
Jim: Thank you.
 
Andy and Darryl: Oh baby I love your way. 
Darryl: Every day. 
Andy and Darryl: Wanna be with you night and day. 
Darryl and Kevin: And day. 
Andy and Darryl: Oh baby I love your way. 
Andy: [scatting] Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.

Gabe: The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients- 
Kelly: Oh my God, kill me! 
Andy: Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay. 
Gabe: Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair- 
Pam: [whispers to Jim] I'm gonna do it. 
Gabe: And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another- 
Pam: Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness! 
Jim: Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
 
Pam: I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
 
Pam: [after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I'm going into labor!
 
Phyllis: Or should I have corndogs. I mean- 
Pam: I'm going into labor!
 
Ryan: Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one- 
Pam: I'm going into labor.
 
Pam: Here we go! 
Andy: Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it. 
Kelly: Yeah. 
Oscar: It's not fair, you guys. 
Kelly: Pitiful. 
Meredith: It's stupid. 
Andy: Never cry wolf. 
Jim: Okay. 
Pam: Okay. 
Erin: Oh. [liquid splatters] 
Pam: Oh! Oh! 
Everyone: Oh! Oh my goodness! 
Jim: Oh my God! 
Pam: I'm really in labor! This is happening! 
Jim: Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you! 
Pam: Oh! 
Jim: How do you feel? 
Erin: Drive carefully! 
Oscar: Good luck! 
Everyone: Goodbye! Good luck! [empty bottle falls to the ground] 
Pam: False alarm.
 
Andy: [on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.
 
Andy: I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
 
Andy: Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that? 
Erin: It's right here in PA. 
Andy: [gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is- 
Angela: Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg. 
Andy: That sounds super inspiring! I'm in! 
Dwight: Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War. 
Oscar: Actually it is the northernmost. 
Dwight: Ha!
 
Dwight: The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
 
Andy: Charge! 
Phyllis: Well, this could be fun. I- 
Andy: Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal? 
Ryan: What's the halal option? 
Andy: Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese. 
Ryan: Out. 
Andy: You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me? 
Erin: I'm in. 
Phyllis: I'm in too. 
Dwight: Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction. 
Andy: Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge. 
Kevin: Yes!
 
Andy: [passes out hats] One for you. 
Erin: Cool. Thanks. 
Andy: And one for you. 
Jim: Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head] 
Andy: And- oh. You missed your head. [laughs and puts hat on Jim's head] There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
 
Andy: All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War. 
Darryl: You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV. 
Phyllis: Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless? 
Andy: It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it. 
Everyone: Limitless! Limitless! Limitless! Limitless! 
Andy: All right, all right, all right.
 
Kevin: Not food and stuff. 
Pam: Here. Like it? 
Kevin: Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit. 
Pam: I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies. 
Kevin: The fire pit is a no-brainer. 
Robert: Oh, hi there. 
Pam: Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again. 
Robert: Where is everyone? Where is Andy? 
Kelly: Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg. 
Robert: Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here... is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office. 
Ryan: Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon. 
Robert: So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! [wakes her up] Excited!
 
Kevin: [tries stapler/marker combo] Okay.
 
Andy: You guys... 
Darryl: J-j-j-ju... 
Andy: Get excited! 
Darryl: Shh! Movie's almost over. 
Andy: All right! We're here. Limitless can wait. 
Gabe: Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.'
Andy: Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back. 
Darryl: I got Source Code on the way back. 
Everyone: Ooh! All right! 
Andy: Woo! 
Andy: Whoa, where you going? 
Jim: Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right? 
Andy: Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists. 
Jim: No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour. 
Phyllis: Yeah, sign says "Begin tour here." 
Andy: Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
 
Andy: After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch. 
Erin: [to Dwight] Yeah, but I'm confused... 
Dwight: Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre... 
Erin: Mm-hmm. 
Dwight: ...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms. 
Erin: Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths. 
Dwight: Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written. 
Oscar: Dwight, what are you telling this girl? 
Dwight: The truth. 
Oscar: Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better. 
Erin: Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said. 
Dwight: No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth. 
Erin: Interesting. 
Dwight: Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed. 
Oscar: Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal? 
Dwight: Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this- 
Oscar: he's a historian. 
Dwight: Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war? 
Oscar: Yes, yes, yes! 
Dwight: Not by a long shot! 
Erin: No! 
Oscar: Yes! 
Dwight: No, it was not! 
Oscar: Argh! 
Dwight: No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern? 
Oscar: What? 
Dwight: Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle! 
Oscar: Erin- 
Dwight: Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar. 
Erin: Get out of here!
 
Robert: I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we? 
Ryan: May I go first? 
Robert: Absolutely. 
Ryan: Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper. 
Robert: This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with? 
Ryan: Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so- 
Robert: That was bad.
 
Stanley: If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister. 
Robert: The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with. 
Stanley: In the African-American community- 
Robert: No. 
Stanley: [murmurs] Thought it was worth a try.
 
Darryl: That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought? 
Park Ranger: Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most- 
Dwight: Excuse me, I got a question for you. 
Park Ranger: Sure. 
Dwight: Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms? 
Park Ranger: Uh, I haven't heard of that one. 
Dwight: Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut? 
Oscar: I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding. 
Andy: We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho! 
Chelsea: [taps Gabe's shoulder] Are you Lincoln? 
Gabe: No, no, I'm-
 
Gabe: Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it. Chelsea's Mom: Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture. 
Gabe: Okay, Quick. 
Man: Hey! Lincoln's starting. [light applause] 
Gabe: Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
 
Pam: Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it. 
Robert: I am not. 
Pam: Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
 
Pam: At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
 
Robert: Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is. 
Kevin: Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So... 
Robert: Cookies. Cookie placement. 
Kevin: Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.' 
Robert: Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? [everyone raises their hand, Robert laughs] There you go. Consensus.
 
Ryan: Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
 
Gabe: [as Lincoln] I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits. 
Audience: No!
 
Kevin: 'Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it. 
Robert: Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants? 
Stanley: how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal. 
Robert: That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. [laughs] 
Kevin: Thank you.
 
Jim: By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus? 
Andy: Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought. 
Jim: Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry. 
Andy: Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride. 
Darryl: Hunger for hamburger. 
Erin: Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl? 
Darryl: That's good. 
Andy: Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars. 
Jim: Only two hundred dollars? 
Andy: We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left. 
Darryl: Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man. 
Andy: Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
 
Andy: Spangler Springs is a mile this way. 
Jim: Oh wow. So that’s two miles if you incorporate the walk back. 
Andy: Its… I mean come on. 
Phyllis: I don’t think I should walk anymore. You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast. Two poached eggs. And then half a sandwich on the bus. 
Andy: Alright fine. You know what – I guess this place just hasn’t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I’m still going. And I’m not going to ask anymore. I’m not even going to look back. I’m just going to assume that you’re with me. 
Dwight: [Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren’t going to look back.
 
Robert: And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared? 
Kevin: I don’t know. 
Robert: Right. I mean you’re an accountant. Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane. 
Kevin: Yes. I am an accountant.
 
Oscar: Dwight – this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him. 
Dwight: Really? 
Oscar: Yeah. 
Dwight: Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms. 
Archivist: Schrute Farms did you say? That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil War. 
Oscar: You’ve heard about it? 
Dwight: YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.
 
Archivist: There you go. 
Narrator: Families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front. 
Soldier: Dearest mother I’m sorry it has been so long since my last letter. It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive. Melvin Fifer Garris. 
Dwight: Hallowed ground. 
Narrator: But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all. It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war. 
Amanda:[on film] You have to understand. Poets, artists, dancers – these kind of men preferred peace to war. These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms. Amidst the macho brutality of war this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive… and well… fabulous. 
Oscar: Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up. 
Dwight: I’ve seen enough. 
Oscar: You’re right. There should be a monument to this.
 
Kevin: Never trust a cookie with a woman’s name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. They’ll just break your heart. 
Robert: [laughing] Kevin! 
Ryan: Robert I hate to interrupt. But I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac idea. 
Kevin: What?!? No! 
Robert: Big Mac idea. That sounds encouraging. 
Ryan: It’s really, really good Robert. Let me explain. 
Kevin: No! This is not fair! This is my idea. He’s trying to steal it because he’s jealous of me. 
Robert: Well what is the idea? 
Kevin: Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands. 
Ryan: You know what? Now I remember. That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea. 
Robert: Oh my. It was just actually cookies the whole time?
 
Andy: [making pencil imprint] Dammit. 
Darryl: Hey. 
Andy: You guys came. Where’s everyone else? 
Darryl: Back at the bus. We were locked out. Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich. 
Andy: Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders. 
Jim: Yeah sorry everyone else didn’t come. I think they’re just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery. 
Andy: Even without an audience you’re still at it. 
Jim: What are you talking about? 
Andy: Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That’s what you did with this trip. 
Jim: Andy – this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It’s just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you’re our regional manager. And guess what man? You don’t have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you don’t believe me take a look at what’s on my head. I’m wearing a very pink hat. I’ve been getting weird looks all day because I’m pretty sure “DM does GB” means something kinda sexual. But guess who’s wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That’s huge. 
Andy: You don’t like the hats? 
Jim: They’re terrible. 
Darryl: I hate myself. 
Andy: They just didn’t turn out how I wanted. In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
 
Andy: [voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that’s good because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general. But I guess it’s really more like they’re just people who work in an office and I’m their manager. Yeah that’s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
 
Gabe: Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. [in Lincoln voice] Oh Mary this is wonderful… Ok Mary stop your scolding. I’ll be quiet. [aside to the audience] I need her like I need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] BANG! Ooh [Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink “DM does GB” hat and runs off]

Dwight: [knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
 
Dwight: Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
 
Dwight: Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you’re in a suicide cult. 
Creed: No. No. No. You’re way off on that one. 
Dwight: Oh yeah? 
Oscar: Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot. 
Jim: Hey guys let’s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight’s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he’s never, ever going to go back on it right? 
Dwight: That’s right Jim.
 
Darryl: Hey man. 
Dwight: [jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey. 
Darryl: Taking a load off huh? 
Dwight: No. Putting a load on more like it. 
Darryl: Good luck with that. 
Dwight: Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
 
Dwight: [to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums] 
Jim: [sees a pole poking out Dwight’s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet] 
Dwight: What are you doing? Give that back. Come on! 
Jim: Prank! [throws money from Dwight’s wallet on the floor] 
Dwight: Oh that’s real creative. 
Jim: You know what it’s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right? 
Dwight: I could, but I just don’t feel like it loser. 
Jim: Because you’re sitting? 
Dwight: Standing. 
Jim: Ok. 
Dwight: Don’t! 
Jim: Because you’re sitting? 
Dwight: Standing. 
Jim: You know I have to do this. 
Dwight: I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
 
Andy: [signing his name] Andrew… Baines… Bernard. 
Jim: I think you could just do Andy Bernard. 
Andy: Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it’s like taking a test, but I know the answers. 
Robert: [loudly knocking on the window] In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. [to Mrs. California] There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator? 
Andy: What was that? 
Jim: I don’t know. He wasn’t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn’t hire his wife.
 
Ryan: That’s why my foundation – The Dream for a Wish Foundation – is going to put them out of business. They’re not going to know what hit them. 
Robert: Everyone. I’d like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone. 
Susan: Hello. Oh call me Susan please. 
Robert: Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she’s here today to see if there’s a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager. 
Susan: Hello nice to meet you. 
Andy: Hey there. It’s a pleasure. 
Robert: Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she’ll shine. 
Andy: I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We’re 100 percent staffed up. 
Robert: Andy. Let’s see if there’s a good fit first. Then we’ll talk. 
Andy: Alright.
 
Dwight: Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. 
Darryl: You don’t have to say it if you’re doing it. 
Dwight: [laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics? 
Darryl: Uh weight lifting yeah. 
Dwight: Well today’s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look? 
Darryl: I’ll take a look. 
Dwight: Your path from obesity begins right here!
 
Darryl: I’ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn’t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
 
Dwight: Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
 
Andy: Alright! The DM Express is pulling out. 
Susan: Well it was really nice to meet you Brian. 
Ryan: Actually Ryan. 
Susan: Oh, Ryan.
 
Ryan: Bitttch!
 
Andy: We will start here at Erinville. 
Susan: Hi. 
Erin: Hoo-hoo! 
Andy: Reception. Your classic one-man operation. 
Erin: Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries. 
Andy: I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying. 
Robert: Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn’t you agree Andy? 
Andy: I’ll explore exploring it. 
Robert: Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I’ll just duck out and run the company for a while. 
Andy: Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ‘er rip. What do you hate about this place? 
Jim: Well it’s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection. 
Dwight: Maybe you do. Hi. I’m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It’s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it. 
Andy: Jim? 
Jim: Well it’s not that easy. It’s kind of sometimes difficult. 
Dwight: It’s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom. 
Susan: I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that. 
Dwight: That is true. 
Andy: You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute. 
Dwight: That’s me. 
Andy: Dwight why don’t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals. 
Dwight: Maybe over a beer after she’s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise]. 
Susan: Well make that a red wine and I’ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
 
Andy: Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they’ve ever been to me. What I wouldn’t give for one of Phyllis’ classic room clearing farts right now.
 
Dwight: Ready? What do you think? 
Darryl: Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5. 
Dwight: You haven’t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let’s go over membership. I’m going to need the first month’s and the last month’s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month… 
Darryl: Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I’m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym. 
Dwight: Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire] 
Darryl: Make a real gym.
 
Susan: I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping. 
Andy: But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is. 
Susan: Uh I could work in customer service. HR even. 
Andy: Those are fully staffed as well. 
Robert: Are you telling me that there’s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands? 
Andy: [laughing nervously] Yes. 
Robert: I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do. 
Andy: Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about- 
Susan: Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there’s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don’t we just let it go. 
Robert: No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think. 
Andy: There are lots of considerations. 
Robert: I would be eternally grateful. It’s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one. 
Andy: Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
 
Susan: So what happens next? 
Andy: We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello? 
Robert: [on phone] Say hello grandma. 
Andy: Hi gam-gam. 
Robert: Hold one finger up to Susan. You’ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, “are you taking your medicine?” 
Andy: Are you taking your med-meds? 
Robert: Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones] 
Susan: You didn’t say goodbye to your grandma. 
Andy: We promised we’d never say goodbye.
 
Dwight: Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion. 
Oscar: All I need is another gym. As if I don’t have enough drama. 
Phyllis: We have a gym at home. It’s called the bedroom. 
Oscar: Who’s spotting who? Don’t use the bike in the corner. That’s Bruce’s. Jeremy says… 
Angela: Enough Oscar, enough. 
Dwight: Kelly? 
Kelly: I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
 
Dwight: That’s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
 
Toby: Did you bring your passport with you? 
Susan: Who walks around with their passport? 
Toby: Well, I do. Always ready for adventure. 
Susan: Have you had any? 
Toby: No. 
Andy: [sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away. 
Oscar: Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her? 
Andy/Oscar: it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her. 
Kevin: How can we do that? She's simply wonderful. 
Angela: This is all pathetic. 
Andy: I am not asking, I am ordering. 
Oscar: How mean are we talking about? 
Andy: It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable. 
Erin: Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
 
Erin: Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler] 
Susan: Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer. 
Erin: Well that's a sales desk. 
Kevin: Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
 
Jim: No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
 
Oscar: That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim] 
Jim: Oh, wow. So cute. 
Susan: Oh, that is so cute- 
Phyllis: [grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle? 
Oscar: Yeah, he's in a ladle. 
Erin: That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle? 
Oscar: He did it himself. 
Phyllis: Is that ladle stainless or... 
Oscar: Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma. 
Susan: Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles] 
Oscar: It's not that kind of ladle. 
Jim: Very cute. [holds out the phone] 
Susan: Aw, let me see- 
Oscar: [grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
 
Susan: I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
 
Susan: Your employees don't seem to be taking to me. 
Robert: Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this. 
Andy: [in robot voice] What is going on? 
Robert: [chuckles] Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night. 
Andy: Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you? 
Susan: Do you not want me here? 
Andy: Why would you say that? 
Susan: It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either. 
Andy: It's not that, exactly. 
Susan: But it is something. 
Andy: Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that. 
Susan: Why would you not want me working here? 
Andy: I don't know. [chuckles] 
Susan: I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he? 
Andy: Yes! The dude is an enigma. 
Susan: Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he? 
Andy: Ah... [stammers] 
Susan: Got it.
 
Dwight: What do you think you're doing? 
Darryl: Getting my sweat on. 
Dwight: I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds? 
Darryl: I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill. 
Dwight: I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was? 
Darryl: No. 
Dwight: Eight minutes! 
Darryl: Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow. 
Dwight: Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James! 
Darryl: It's Lejon Brames. 
Dwight: That's what I said. 
Darryl: You know, get it right. 
Dwight: I know.
 
Andy: [to Susan] Cameras... 
Robert: [enters] Oh, still here. Terrific. 
Susan: Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here. 
Robert: Well that's a shame. 
Andy: It just was one of those things- 
Susan: Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine. 
Robert: Where did this come from? Did Andy say that? 
Susan: No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him. 
Robert: What's the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person. 
Susan: You sure about that? 
Robert: Absolutely. 
Susan: No games? 
Robert: No games. 
Susan: Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me. 
Robert: Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest. 
Susan: Andy? 
Andy: Yes? 
Susan: Why do you keep looking at my husband? 
Robert: Andy, just answer the question. 
Andy: No games? 
Robert: No games. 
Andy: Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, "in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen." [laughs] 
Robert: You lying son of a bitch!
 
Robert: Tell my wife you're lying. 
Andy: I am lying. I am a compulsive liar. 
Susan: That's not true, is it? 
Andy: No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there. 
Robert: This is preposterous. 
Susan: Robert... 
Robert: Let's get Jim in here. [Jim shoves out of fram in his chair, Robert looks for Jim] Where's Jim? 
Erin: He just rolled out and crawled out. 
Robert: Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.
 
Jim: [to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
 
Robert: [sees Jim's abandoned car] That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere.
 
Jim: [shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right? 
Creed: Okay. What about your friend? 
Jim: Oh boy.
 
Dwight: This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
Darryl: Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say. 
Dwight: First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor. 
Darryl: Okay, I'm not doing that. 
Dwight: Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl! 
Gabe: I didn't know Darryl joined. 
Darryl: Looks that way. 
Gabe: Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.
 
Robert: Hello Jim. [Jim tries to escape] 
Andy: [grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!
 
Robert: So I think you know what we want to know. 
Jim: Do I? 
Robert: Yes. 
Jim: [mutters] I know, I do. 
Andy: Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness. 
Jim: I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can... 
Susan: For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here? 
Jim: That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse. 
Andy: [laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer. 
Robert: No. 
Andy: That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day. 
Jim: Perfect! 
Susan: Jim... 
Jim: Yes? 
Susan: Answer the question, please. 
Jim: [sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking. 
Robert: All right. Thanks. 
Jim: Yes. All right. Great. [leaves] 
Andy: Uh... 
Robert: Yeah. 
Andy: Yep.
 
Susan: [Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves] 
Robert: [claps Andy's shoulder] Heh.
 
Susan: Andy. 
Andy: Hey, Mrs. California. 
Susan: Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today. 
Andy: You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me. 
Susan: Yeah, I thought we really hit it off. 
Andy: Yeah. 
Susan: Well, different circumstances. 
Andy: Yeah. 
Susan: Who knows? 
Andy: Who knows? 
Susan: Maybe after all this settles down... 
Andy: Totally. 
Susan: It's a date. 
Andy: Hmm?
 
Dwight: You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh? 
Darryl: This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy. 
Dwight: Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again! 
Darryl: Dwight, come back and spot me. 
Dwight: All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want? 
Darryl: To push this bar up. 
Dwight: No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal? 
Darryl: Help me! 
Dwight: What do you want!?! 
Darryl: To look good for Val! 
Dwight: Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.

Andy: [Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
 
Andy: Who's excited to get their holiday wishes? 
Stanley: Holiday wishes. 
Andy: What's that, Stanley? 
Stanley: We know exactly what holiday you're referring to. 
Andy: It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party. 
Stanley: I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
 
Jim: I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
 
Stanley: I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
 
Meredith: What is the status on my wish? 
Andy: Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required. 
Dwight: What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood? 
Andy: That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon. 
Dwight: Where? Dark side or light side? 
Andy: Light side. 
Dwight: Is it by the Sea of Tranquility? 
Andy: As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront. 
Dwight: Thank you, Andy. 
Andy: So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is. 
Jim: She's not your grandmother, is she? 
Andy: Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time? 
Jim: Yeah. 
Andy: Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee. 
Creed: That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man? 
Andy: Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.
 
Erin: I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
 
Kelly: I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be. 
Erin: Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly. 
Kelly: It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her. 
Erin: That's OK, I don't want you to do that. 
Robert: [laughing] Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati. 
Kelly: Eww, what is that? 
Robert: The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts. 
Kelly: Cool. 
Kevin: Hey, man. 
Robert: Hey! [Kevin embraces Robert in a tight hug] Oh! 
Kevin: How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you? 
Oscar: Kevin? 
Robert: I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla. 
Kevin: Yeah. 
Robert: It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse. 
Andy: Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up. 
Robert: I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking. [gestures to Andy in Santa costume] 
Andy: Oh, thank you.
 
Andy: Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words “HARD ASS”] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps. 
Dwight: Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye. 
Jim: It wasn't me. 
Andy: It wasn't either of you. 
Jim: Kathy wants to leave our clump? 
Andy: Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he. 
Dwight: I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm] 
Jim: Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back] 
Andy: Hey! Hey! Respect the hat! 
Jim: Pam never seemed to have a problem with us. 
Andy: Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay. 
Jim: What was that? 
Dwight: What is it? 
Andy: Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person. 
Jim: Can't do that. 
Dwight: No, absolutely not. 
Andy: You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
 
Jessica: Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy? 
Erin: Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin. 
Jessica: Oh! [laughs] Oof! 
Erin: Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here. 
Jessica: Oh.
 
Andy: My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.
 
Andy: Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi. 
Jessica: Hi. 
Andy: Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr. 
Erin: Wow. 
Andy: Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist. 
Jessica: Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office. 
Erin: Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess. 
Andy: What? 
Jessica: Oh. 
Erin: Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve] 
Andy: Oh no. 
Jessica: Ah..[laughs] 
Andy: Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis. 
Jessica: Spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh] 
Erin: Oh.
 
Darryl: This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution. 
Val: Thank you. 
Darryl: Alright. 
Val: Alright. 
Darryl: Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about. 
Val: Isn't that just for popsicles? 
Darryl: Popsicles? 
Val: Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt? 
Nate: Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I... 
Darryl: Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid. 
Nate: You had me at “clookies.” I can't wait to find out what they are. 
Val: What should I wear? 
Darryl: Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up. 
Nate: I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
 
Jim: Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
 
Jim: Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
 
Robert: Erin, what can I get for you? 
Erin: Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it. 
Robert: Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots! 
Ryan: Yes! 
Oscar: Yes! 
Ryan: Will do. 
Robert: The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too. 
Phyllis: One, two three! [group takes shots] 
Kevin: Yes. 
Erin: OK. [takes shot, group laughs] 
Robert: Mmm. Wow. 
Erin: Whoo! Jiminy Christmas! 
Robert: Jiminey Christmas indeed. 
Erin: Hit 'er up. 
Robert: Oh. 
Kevin: Oh yes. 
Ryan: Whoo! 
Erin: Yeah! [laughs] 
Oscar: Wow.
 
Jim: [on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
 
Jim: So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
 
Dwight: [laughing] Boom!
 
Ryan: But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do... 
Kevin: Good cookie.
 
Darryl: I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster. 
Val: OK. 
Darryl: I thought you'd wear a sweater. 
Val: Since when does a sweater mean “dressed up”? Am I your grandson? 
Darryl: Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you. 
Val: As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.
 
Erin: [imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap! 
Stanley: That's right. [laughs] 
Erin: Whoo! [group laughs] Thank you. 
Robert: She, she is remarkable. 
Andy: Edgy impressions. 
Erin: Thank you. 
Andy: How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home. 
Erin: A thousand. 
Andy: Whoa! Maybe you should take a break. 
Erin: [serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
 
Dwight: Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer! 
Toby: Oh my god. 
Dwight: Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature! 
Jim: I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine? 
Dwight: Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up? 
Jim: Hmm... 
Toby: You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
 
Toby: Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.
 
Angela: Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective. 
Toby: No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife. 
Dwight: Hello? Lacerated hand here folks. 
Jim: Nice try, this is ridiculous. 
Dwight: Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA. 
Jim: Three times. 
Dwight: You see? 
Andy: Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it. 
Jim: Andy, you've gotta be kidding me. 
Toby: Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand... 
Kelly: Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand? 
Jim: OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control... 
Dwight: Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute. 
Angela: No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs. 
Jim: [on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up. 
Dwight: Come down right away! 
Jim: [on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled? 
Dwight: Yes, I was quilled. 
Jim: And what's it's name? 
Dwight: Henrietta. 
Jim: Oops. [hangs up] 
Andy: What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
 
[Dynamite by Taio Cruz plays in the background] 
Erin: Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair. 
Jessica: [laughs] Thank you. 
Erin: I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone. 
Andy: OK! 
Erin: And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say “get a drink”. [blows kisses and dances away] 
Jessica: That's uh, that's the girl you dated. 
Andy: Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um... 
Jessica: No, she, she seems fine. 
Andy: Yeah, uh, excuse me. 
Jessica: OK. 
Andy: Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey! 
Erin: Hey. 
Andy: Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes? 
Erin: Every martini has an olive. 
Andy: OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something. 
Kevin: I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk. 
Erin: Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish. 
Andy: Ah, OK. 
Erin: It's about you. 
Andy: That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something. 
Erin: [slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead. 
Andy: You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something. 
Erin: I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth. 
Andy: Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back. 
Erin: Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves] 
Kevin: Hey. 
Erin: Hey. 
Kevin: So, there was talk of oatmeal.
 
Phyllis: You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess. 
Val: Yeah. Thanks.
 
Andy: I swear... 
Jessica: Did you not... 
Andy: I was too embarrassed! [group laughs] 
Jim: Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that? 
Phyllis: Is that Cici? 
Jim: Yes. It is. 
Andy: Um. 
Phyllis: That's awful. 
Andy: Cici is Jim's daughter. 
Jessica: Oh my god. How could somebody do that? 
Jim: I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though. 
Oscar: Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this? 
Jim: I don't- 
Andy: I know who did this....Dwight. 
Phyllis: Dwight? 
Jim: Yeah. 
Andy: Dwight. 
Oscar: No! 
Phyllis: He should pay. 
Andy: Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able. 
Jim: O...K. 
Andy: It's, I mean. 
Jim: Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it’s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like... 
Oscar: That's no accident. 
Jim: Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident. 
Phyllis: What? 
Oscar: What? 
Jim: I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
 
[Christmas Time is Here by Vince Guaraldi Trio is playing in the background] 
Dwight: Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
 
Jim: You alright, Santa? 
Andy: You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends? 
Jim: Yes. 
Andy: Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
Jim: Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah. 
Andy: No...I don't, hmm, I don't know. 
Jim: OK. 
Andy: By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work. 
Jim: Alright. I will definitely do that. 
Andy: Alright, I'll tell Dwight. 
Jim: You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway. 
Andy: Christmas miracles do happen. 
Jim: Yes. They totally do.
 
Ryan: You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses. 
Kelly: Well help me, OK? Just, uh take... 
Ryan: I'm trying but you need to- 
Erin: Hey. 
Kelly: Yo. 
Erin: Game on. 
Kelly: On it.
 
Jessica: [group laughing] I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful... 
Kelly: Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
 
Kelly: And that, is how it's done.
 
Erin: I would like another alcohol. 
Robert: Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar. 
Oscar: What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
 
Robert: Your heart is broken. So is mine. 
Erin: And... 
Robert: And what? 
Erin: And you have any advice or anything? 
Robert: No [laughs] my god. 
Erin: ...Help me feel better... 
Robert: I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice....I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better.
 
Nate: When you do your makeup, 
Jessica: Uh huh. 
Nate: How long you, does it take usually? Cause... 
Jessica: Um, it ta-, um it depends.
 
Toby: …..Chad Flendermen's kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo] 
Creed: Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here. 
Darryl: Hi.
 
Jessica: I'll see you at home? 
Andy: OK great. 
Jessica: OK 
Andy: Perfect. 
Jessica: Bye [kiss]...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it. 
Andy: I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish. 
Jessica: Oh 
Meredith: Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad. 
Jessica: OK [laughs] Bye. 
Andy: OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith, 
Meredith: Thank you Santa. 
Andy: You bet.
 
Andy: Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
 
Andy: Let's go, let's go. 
Meredith: I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. 
Andy: Hang on. 
Meredith: Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out] 
Andy: What? 
Meredith: Whoa! My stuff! 
Andy: What is all that? 
Meredith: It's my valuables! 
Andy: It's junk! 
Meredith: This is my treasures, no they're my treasures! 
Andy: You're a hoarder. My god! 
Meredith: No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful. 
Andy: Ah! My Santa suit's stuck. 
Dwight: [laughs while spray painting “Jim is Awesome” on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
 
Meredith: Where are we? This ain't my street. 
Andy: Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh. 
Meredith: Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh? 
Andy: Oh my god. 
Meredith: Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood? 
Andy: Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now. 
Robert: Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning. 
Erin: Thank you, goodnight. 
Meredith: What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? 
Andy: I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home. 
Meredith: Ow! Take it easy. 
Andy: Whoo.
 
Dwight: [yawns, “Idiot” is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin? 
Oscar: Dwight. 
Dwight: Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
 
Jim: Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.

[No one is talking in the office, Jim holds up sign that reads “We're on the longest silent streak in office history! Nobody has said anything in... 14 min!”, Dwight hangs up on a phone call rather than speak, Andy sees a raccoon eating a hamburger and tries to describe it using charades, Kevin opens a candy bar and takes a bite] 
Kevin: Oh yeah! 
All: Aw! 
Dwight: Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper. 
Oscar: You really have to say "oh yeah" every time you eat a candy bar? 
Kevin: I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah! 
Jim: All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to. 
Andy: It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person! 
Dwight: You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane. 
Jim: Okay, done. 
Erin: [shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit? 
Darryl: Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter] 
Jim: All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
 
Andy: [writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper? 
Jim: You can write a book about chairs. 
Andy: Books! Excellent, Jim. 
Oscar: Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper- 
Andy: [gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause] 
Jim: Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is. 
Andy: I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply! 
Angela: Andy, you want us to buy our own paper? 
Andy: Yes!
 
Andy: Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
 
Dwight: Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
 
Dwight: Dwight Schrute for Robert California! 
Receptionist: Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all? 
Dwight: I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine. 
Receptionist: Ooh. I'm glad you're on our team. Here, please have a seat. 
Gabe: Dwight? What are you doing here? 
Dwight: Gabe? You don't know? 
Gabe: Course I know. 
Dwight: Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
 
Gabe: Corporate says to me, “Gabe, we need you in Scranton.” Scranton says, “Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.” So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
 
Robert: Dwight. 
Dwight: Robert. 
Robert: You made it. 
Dwight: Yes. 
Robert: Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. [Gabe laughs] Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly. 
Dwight: Very good.
 
Andy: Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to "play ball." Those were his words. 
Oscar: Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error! 
Andy: So make that error! 
Oscar: Andy, no- 
Kevin: Hey! I can make that error. 
Oscar: [clicks tongue] Aw... 
Andy: Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that. 
Kevin: No, I- 
Andy: It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say? 
Oscar: I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia. 
Andy: Oh. 
Oscar: Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse! 
Andy: What? 
Oscar: It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me. 
Andy: You know what? Go. Have fun.
 
Andy: There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia. 
Jim: Stop right there. I love it. 
Darryl: I'm in. 
Andy: I didn't even say what it is. 
Darryl: It's trivia. 
Jim: In Philadelphia. 
Andy: But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase... 
Jim: That's a great idea. 
Darryl: That's a great plan. 
Andy: Yeah? You like it? 
Jim: Yeah. 
Andy: All right. 
Jim: All right, good stuff. 
Andy: I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, "this sounds really stupid." 
Darryl: You just made a good idea, a great idea. 
Andy: There is one problem with this plan. 
Darryl: What? 
Andy: We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
 
Gabe: [on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up] 
Dwight: Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy. 
Gabe: Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What's the most important appliance in your house? 
Dwight: Meat grinder. 
Gabe: [makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential. 
Dwight: You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic. 
Robert: Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO. 
Dwight: But I can give you this pitch in one minute- 
Robert: No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight. [leaves] 
Gabe: CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes. 
Dwight: Still an important position. Still a chief. 
Gabe: You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe's phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking. 
Robert: Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard. 
Gabe: Your wish is my command. 
Robert: It's a command.
 
Oscar: I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy? 
Andy: You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you. 
Oscar: What? No! 
Andy: I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it. 
Oscar: And you guys thought this was a good idea? 
Jim: I thought it was a fun idea. 
Darryl: There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar. 
Andy: Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay? 
Oscar: Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now? 
All: No. Nah. 
Oscar: What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs] 
Andy: It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar’s friend walks up] Not anything. 
Oscar: Good luck. 
Andy: Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves. 
Meredith: Good-timers follow me. 
Phyllis: Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups] 
Stanley: Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here. 
Andy: A-team. 
Jim: Okay. 
Andy: All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team] 
Kevin: Okay. [leaves] 
Jim: There's a table over here.
 
Host: All right, first question everyone: Ray Charles famously had this state on his mind. What is its capital? 
Andy: Oh, we got this! 
Creed: Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska? 
Stanley: Atlanta. 
Phyllis: Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held. 
Cathy: My cousins were actually at those Olympics. 
Stanley: Keep talking all you want. 
Kevin: How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about? 
Erin: Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness. 
Host: Okay, time's up. Let's get the boards up. "Atlanta, Georgia" is the correct answer. [Kevin holds up “What is...SEE-attle”]
 
Gabe: Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got- 
Dwight: [sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here. 
Gabe: Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
Dwight: What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant! 
Receptionist: This must be very frustrating. 
Gabe: I can see you in the jungle now.
 
Host: Okay, now, you're not an all-star of the NBA, but you did get your game on when you won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in 2011. Who are you? 
Andy: Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine. 
Jim: Shawn Marion. 
Darryl: Yes, Shawn Marion. 
Ryan: That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington. 
Jim: Wrong, for so many reasons. 
Phyllis: Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful? 
Stanley: That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river. 
Kevin: Ron Artest, Kelly. 
Kelly: No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar. 
Host: All right, boards up. Let's see who got it. "Lamar Odom" is what we were looking for. "Lamar Odom" Thank you. [scattered cheers] 
Jim: Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes. 
Kevin: Nicely done! 
Andy: You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen. 
Darryl: Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
 
Dwight: So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it! 
Receptionist: Well, you got my vote. 
Dwight: Oh my God. 
Gabe: I know. 
Dwight: Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling? 
Gabe: What? 
Dwight: What's with the smile? 
Gabe: You're doing great. You know, so good. 
Dwight: And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us. 
Gabe: Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow! 
Dwight: Take me to Robert. 
Gabe: Ow! He went home. 
Dwight: Take me to his house. 
Gabe: Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing. 
Dwight: You know where it is. Lead me there. 
Gabe: Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help! 
Dwight: Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
 
Host: Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir? 
Ryan: Yeah? 
Host: I'm sure you're just checking your Grindr account... [laughter] but you can't check smart phones during trivia, it's against the rules. 
Ryan: Okay, I'm turning it off. 
Host: Okay, you're not turning it off. 
Ryan: I won't look at it. 
Host: Sir? 
Ryan: I can't- I can't not touch it. 
Host: Okay, then we're going to have to take it away. [employee takes the phone] Thank you. 
Ryan: Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves] 
Host: All right, guys. After nine rounds, let's check the scores. In first place, with nine points, it's Aesop's Foibles. [Oscar's team touches fingers] The Queerenstein Bears have seven points. [a team of hairy men growl] Dunder-Mifflin A-Team has four points. 
Jim: [claps] All right. 
Host: D.M. Backup Team has three points. The Einsteins have eight points. [the "just-for-fun” Dunder-Mifflin team cheers] Ladies Gaga have five points. [more cheering] 
Andy: So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
 
Dwight: Which one is it? 
Gabe: I don't know. All I know is the building. 
Dwight: Robert! Robert California! Robert! 
Robert: Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.
 
Host: All right guys, time's up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait. Except for the Einsteins. That's all right. Which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. So let's get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins. 
Kevin: Oh yeah! 
Kelly: What! [cheers] 
Host: In second place, we have the Queerenstein Bears. 
Queerenstein Bears: Whoo! Let's go! 
Host: And, in first place, is Aesop's Foibles. 
Oscar's friend: Whoo! 
Darryl: Yeah, we're going to get clobbered. 
Host: Ring it in when you know it. First question: This man had a fatwa declared on him when- [Erin rings bell] Einsteins? 
Meredith: What? 
Erin: What is it? 
Meredith: What? 
Erin: I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell] 
Host: Aesop's? 
Oscar: Salman Rushdie. 
Host: Salman Rushdie is correct. [applause] Heading out to sea, sailors. On a square-rigged ship, the sale set furthest forward is called what? [Erin rings bell] 
Meredith: Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless- 
Erin: Flying jib. 
Host: Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins. [cheers and applause]
 
Robert: Shalom. [sighs] Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. [grunt] I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month. [slaps the mat, they wrestle] 
Stu: Grab my knee! 
Gabe: Yay Robert! 
Robert: Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge.
 
Host: According to a recent survey, this is the most common learning disability among American adolescents. 
Oscar's friend: [rings bell] Boom! ADHD! 
Host: No. [another bell rings] 
Meredith: Wrong. The answer is dyslexia! 
Host: That's correct for the Einsteins. [cheers and applause] 
Andy: [dances] Whoo! Yeah! 
Host: Sir- 
Andy: Go Einsteins! 
Host: Dial it back, this isn't Tail Feathers, okay? [laughter]
 
Robert: They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they? 
Dwight: No thank you. 
Robert: Sit down, Dwight. 
Dwight: Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, "table for one?" How is this possible? 
Robert: You were dining alone? All those people are you? 
Dwight: Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going- 
Robert: Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's basement: It's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right? 
Dwight: N... it's complicated. 
Robert: [holds a medal to the light] This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal] 
Dwight: It's a job interview, not a flea market. 
Robert: Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place. 
Dwight: Yes.
 
Host: Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope you're ready to play doctor. Our question is about health and the human body. 
Andy: Oh, come on! 
Host: The standard American analog scale has a maximum capacity of what weight? [bell rings] 
Kevin: Three hundred pounds! 
Host: Point for the Einsteins. [applause] Here's your final question. Cinephiles, put on your memory berets: This 2001 masterpiece from Gilles Paquet-Brenner explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray. 
Oscar: [rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon. 
Oscar's friend: Yes! 
Host: I'm sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins. 
Kevin: [rings bell] Les Jolies Choses. 
Meredith: Are you sure? 
Kevin: Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film. 
Host: The Einsteins win it! [applause] 
Oscar: No! Come on!
 
Kevin: Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
 
Stonewall Host: Welcome to the Stonewall Alliance Trivia Championships! First prize is forty-five hundred dollars! 
Kevin: Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
 
Stonewall Host: Riboflavin. 
Kevin: [holds up "Robitussin"] Riboflavin? 
Stonewall Host: Michigan. [Kevin holds up "A Mitten"] The President of the United States is "P.O.T.U.S." [Kevin holds up "P.O.T.A.T.O.”] John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath. [Kevin holds up "The California Raisins"]

Dwight: Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]
 
Jim: It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
 
Dwight: Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs] 
Stanley: You've been meatballed! [laughs] 
Dwight: Ugh. 
Stanley: Are you ready for some meatball? 
Dwight: Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim. 
Jim: I know. 
Stanley: Look for your stapler! 
Dwight: [Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
 
Stanley: [to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul? 
Dwight: Thirty-two meatballs. 
Stanley: Good day.
 
Dwight: That idiot's been feeding us for a week. 
Stanley: We'll never have to buy meatballs again.
 
Erin: [phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
 
Erin: I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
 
Erin: I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay. 
Andy: Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.
 
Andy: My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
 
Jim: [Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though. 
Oscar: Oh, who needs a house that size? 
Dwight: Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait. 
Robert: I'm selling the house, actually. 
Jim: You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent. 
Robert: It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim? 
Jim: I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke. 
Robert: What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard? 
Jim: I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing. 
Robert: Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it. 
Andy: Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here. 
Robert: A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day. 
Andy: Well, please tell Susan we all say hi. 
Kevin: Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs] 
Oscar: Kevin, no. 
Robert: What, as some sort of last hoorah? 
Kevin: Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it. 
Robert: You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food. 
Kevin: Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me? 
Oscar: That was you, Kevin. 
Kevin: It was me.
 
Meredith: You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift. 
Erin: Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever. 
Meredith: It's no problem. You live right near me. 
Erin: How do you know where I live? 
Meredith: Andy followed you home after the Christmas party. 
Erin: Why? 
Meredith: He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you. 
Erin: Oh. Come on.
 
Erin: Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
 
Angela: [sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm. 
Cathy: It's almost too warm. 
Gabe: I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half. 
Ryan: Oh, so close. Eighty-one. 
Gabe: [to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret. 
Cathy: [to Jim] Hey, late guy. 
Jim: Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party. 
Andy: Oh. 
Jim: DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
 
Jim: You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
 
Jim: Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way. 
Robert: You should see the whole thing. 
Jim: I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you. 
Robert: I'm just about to give the tour. 
Jim: All right- 
Robert: Join us. You must see what you were laughing about. 
Jim: I must...
 
Jessica: [looks at pool] Wow. 
Andy: [hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage. 
Jessica: [sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing? 
Andy: Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh] 
Jessica: Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything? 
Andy: No, I'm good. 
Erin: [runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi. 
Andy: Hi. 
Erin: How is everything? How's your car? 
Andy: It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage. 
Erin: Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain? 
Andy: Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes. 
Erin: Oh, like a goodbye trip. 
Andy: No. What? 
Jessica: Hey. 
Erin: Hi.
 
Erin: I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
 
Darryl: Val. You made it. 
Val: Yup, yup. 
Darryl: Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that? 
Val: You know, you are just as dumb at night. 
Darryl: Mmm. [they clink cups] 
Andy: All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath. 
Jessica: No, show me. 
Andy: Okay. 
Jessica: Dive in right here. 
Andy: In a minute. In a minute. 
Jessica: Okay. You don't know what you're doing. 
Andy: A minute would be cool. 
Erin: Hey, Dwight Snoot. 
Dwight: What- 
Erin: What you doing? 
Dwight: I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her] 
Erin: Ow. 
Andy: Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants? 
Stanley: I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them. 
Andy: Where... [finds pants, looks for ring] 
Erin: Come on, don't you want to play? 
Dwight: Oh really? 
Erin: Yeah. 
Dwight: Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams] 
Kevin: Whoa. 
Angela: Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
 
Robert: Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio. 
Oscar: [sees wine collection] Holy cow! 
Robert: Wine collection. 
Oscar: How many bottles? Three hundred? 
Robert: [laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers. 
Oscar: Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine. 
Toby: Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau. 
Ryan: Robert, you are too kind. 
Robert: Oh. 
Gabe: Too kind doesn't begin to cover it. 
Ryan: With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me. 
Gabe: And Gabe-y makes three. 
Jim: Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical. 
Robert: Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it. 
Jim: Really? Why? 
Robert: I don't know. Maybe not. Just come.
 
Erin: [Dwight dunks her] Oh! 
Dwight: [laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh? 
Erin: Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous. 
Dwight: I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up] 
Erin: [giggles] Oh Dwight!
 
Erin: [giggles] Stop. 
Dwight: You stop. 
Erin: No, you stop. 
Dwight: No, you stop. 
Erin: [to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop. 
Dwight: Okay, you can stop. 
Erin: No, no, no, he's not looking. 
Dwight: No, you can stop. 
Erin: You can actually stop. 
Kelly: Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this? 
Meredith: The main stone's missing. 
Kelly: I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
 
Robert: I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan. 
Jim: Good night. 
Oscar: [raises wine bottle] To the kitchen! 
All: To the kitchen! 
Robert: To the kitchen. Onward! 
Oscar: Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right? 
Toby: Note? It's a symphony. 
Oscar: Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club. 
Toby: I would love that.
 
Toby: Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?
 
Darryl: [to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it. 
Meredith: You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice. 
Val: You in? 
Darryl: Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.
 
Darryl: I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
 
Dwight: [he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah... 
Erin: Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end. 
Dwight: Damn it. 
Erin: What is the most romantic possible thing? 
Dwight: We can get some chicken fights going in the pool. 
Erin: Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you. 
Both: Yes! [they high five and jump in the pool] 
Angela: You're in my way! 
Erin: Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all. 
Dwight: Chicken fight! 
Andy: No thanks. 
Erin: Dang it! What the heck already? 
Dwight: Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight! 
Cathy: Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim? 
Kevin: I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
 
Dwight: Yeah- oh! 
Erin: [knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo! 
Dwight: Woohoo! Yes! 
Erin: Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together. 
Dwight: I know. I could just bang you right now. 
Erin: He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
 
Robert: I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears. 
Jim: To both these bears. 
Ryan: To both these bears. 
Toby: Bears. 
Oscar: To both these bears.
 
Robert: When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies: Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden [bleep] Pond. 
Ryan: I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema. 
Gabe: Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
 
Andy: Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found. 
Kelly: Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it. 
Andy: I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all? 
Kelly: Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about? 
Andy: The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly? 
Phyllis: Oh, I don't think you're being silly. 
Kelly: Oh God. [takes off ring] 
Andy: You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund. 
Phyllis: [snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it. 
Jessica: [to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two. 
Val: [comes up from under water] How was that? 
Kevin: Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand] 
Darryl: Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking. 
Val: No, I'm good. Thank you. 
Darryl: Cool. 
Val: Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim? 
Kevin: That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
 
Jessica: [knocks Erin off Dwight's shoulders] Yes! 
Andy: Yeah! 
Dwight: [to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break. 
Erin: Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what. 
Dwight: Okay. 
Erin: One more? 
Andy: Yeah! 
Jessica: Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap] 
Erin: Mush, mush, mush! Come on! 
Dwight: Go! 
Erin: Go! Okay. Yeah. 
Jessica: Here we go! [knocks Erin over] Yes! 
Andy: Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa! 
Kevin: Wow! 
Andy: I cannot believe you're still up! 
Jessica: I cannot believe it either. 
Erin: I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks] 
Andy: [muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
 
Dwight: [coughs up water] Erin, did we win? 
Erin: Sure. Sure we did. 
Dwight: You're lying. We didn't win. 
Erin: Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
 
Kelly: You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat] 
Angela: We're in the pool! 
Meredith: Shut it, Angela.
 
Dwight: Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday. 
Andy: Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday. 
Dwight: I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation. 
Andy: Mmm. 
Dwight: So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin. 
Andy: Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me. 
Dwight: Not what I asked. 
Andy: We're done. Erin and I are over. 
Dwight: So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex. 
Andy: Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out. 
Dwight: [sighs] You're an idiot. 
Kevin: Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles] 
Erin: Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
Kevin: No! 
Val: Oh I've got him! 
Darryl: Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let's do this!
 
Andy: [Erin swims up with ring] Wow. 
Erin: So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours. 
Andy: Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine? 
Erin: The Bernard family seal. Duh. 
Andy: Duh. 
Erin: Sorry if your special night was ruined. 
Andy: Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night. 
Erin: Oh, you weren't going to do that? 
Andy: Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.
 
Erin: Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
 
Robert: And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness. 
Jim: To madness. 
Ryan: To madness. 
Toby: To madness. [Robert laughs] 
Meredith: To madness. 
Jim: Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van? 
Meredith: Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl. 
Jim: Are you serious? 
Ryan: Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man. 
Gabe: And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like. 
Oscar: [Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine! 
Toby: And I am Bacchus's friend! 
Robert: Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. [Robert strips, jumps in pool, Gabe and Ryan join him] 
All: Yes! Woohoo! Bravo! 
Jim: And there's my talking point.
 
Robert: Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going. 
Ryan: Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave. 
Gabe: So leave.
 
Deleted Scene 1
 
Ryan: Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert? 
Kathy: What's the water like? 
Darryl: Nice. 
Angela: Oh, it is warm.
 
Phyllis: Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
 
Erin: Oh, Dwight. 
Dwight: Uh huh. 
Erin: That feels so good! 
Dwight: Yeah....baby. 
Erin: [grunting] Hey, Andy. 
Andy: Hey. 
Erin: Dwight gives the best back massages. 
Andy: Yeah, it sounds like it. 
Dwight: Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis? 
Erin: I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing] 
Dwight: No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive. 
Erin: You mean more like dangerous curves... 
Dwight: You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor] 
Erin: Ow!
 
Erin: You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
 
Dwight: [Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah. 
Jessica: You guys ready? 
Andy: Bring it on guys. 
Dwight: Yeah... 
Andy: Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool] 
Dwight: Ready? 
Erin: I'm ready. 
Jessica: Whoo! 
Andy: Alright! Here we go. 
Erin: Ok. 
Dwight: RAHHH!!!!!!! 
Jessica: Yeah, come on! 
Dwight: Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin] 
Andy: Hey! High-five! 
Jessica: Yeah!
 
Jessica: My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
 
Robert: This room I liked for the view. I dreamed that I would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before. [laughs] 
Ryan: I get that. 
Gabe: Beautiful sentiment. 
Jim: To the shame room! [raises bottle] 
Gabe: [Robert laughs] I live in this room. 
Oscar: [Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey. 
Toby: Mineral-ey.

Andy: Val, I need the space. 
Val: All right guys, clear out. 
Andy: Everybody out. 
Val: Promise me you're going to clean up. 
Andy: I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do. 
Val: Promise me that- 
Andy: Obviously I'm going to clean up.
 
Andy: Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, "Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance," and then you have to be like, "Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!" And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.
 
Erin: Hey! Jim's back from jury duty. 
Andy: Hey! Tuna! He's back. 
Jim: Hey. 
Andy: Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap. 
Jim: Okay. 
Andy: [grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll. 
Jim: Yeah. 
Phyllis: How was jury duty? 
Jim: It was pretty uneventful, actually. 
Dwight: Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system. 
Erin: What was the case? 
Jim: Uh, hit and run. 
Erin: Ooh, "the case of the hit and run," that's exciting. 
Phyllis: Did you send him to the slammer? 
Jim: Nope. Not guilty. 
Dwight: Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm." 
Jim: We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come. 
Dwight: Not coming, have plans. 
Jim: Okay.
 
Jim: I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
 
Erin: Ah! Angela had the baby! 
Kevin: Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious. 
Darryl: Why? 
Kevin: You know. 
Darryl: Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby? 
Kevin: A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up. 
Ryan: Eh, a little bit. 
Kevin: Oh, did I win the pool? 
Erin: Ah, no. Right month, wrong year. 
Oscar: Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month. 
Erin: We should all go to the hospital and visit her. 
Phyllis: Oh, I'd love to but, um- 
Jim: Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work. 
Oscar: Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family. 
Kevin: Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom. 
Gabe: Everyone, our very own Angela- 
Oscar: We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit. 
Gabe: Oh, I am so in.
 
Gabe: I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
 
Andy: Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets? 
Jim: Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so- 
Meredith: How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us. 
Stanley: Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles. 
Phyllis: Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change. 
Jim: Wow, I'm really sorry. 
Phyllis: Yeah.
 
Jim: I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
 
Jim: [demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually. 
Toby: You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's. 
Jim: Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too. 
Toby: You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck. 
Meredith: Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
 
Dwight: I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
 
Oscar: [whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive. 
Kevin: Got that, bimbo? 
Erin: Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door] 
Angela: Yes? 
Oscar: Knock, knock. Oh! 
Kevin: Hi! 
Angela: Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here? 
Oscar: We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite. 
Senator Lipton: Well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton.
Kevin: Phillip is so fat. 
Oscar: Kevin! 
Kevin: You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby. 
Angela: Hey. 
Senator Lipton: Yes, he's substantial. 
Erin: He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
 
Dwight: So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop... 
Jim: Mm-hmm. 
Dwight: And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane? 
Jim: Mm-hmm. 
Dwight: See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert! 
Jim: Okay, wait, wait. 
Dwight: Yes! Andy, get out here. 
Jim: No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you. 
Dwight: I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights. 
Andy: What's up, gangstas? 
Dwight: Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him! 
Andy: Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory. 
Dwight: I have Jim on the record saying that the vic- 
Andy: No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill. 
Dwight: I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill. 
Andy: Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch. 
Dwight: I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill] 
Andy: Attaboy. Good. Now, chill. 
Dwight: Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right? 
Andy: Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously] 
Dwight: That's good enough for me. [exhales again]
 
Jim: ...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you. 
Andy: I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before. 
Jim: Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth. 
Andy: No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up? 
Jim: No. 
Andy: Do you know why you never heard of it? 
Jim: No. 
Andy: Covered it up. 
Jim: Are you sure you can keep this under wraps? 
Andy: They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
 
Andy: My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
 
Ernesto: [pulls food truck up to where Dwight and Nate are standing] Where you want I park?
 
Dwight: Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas] 
Toby: Ernesto! 
Ernesto: Hola Toby! [mimes choking] 
Toby: Yeah, hey. 
Ernesto: Como esta? [speaks Spanish] 
Nate: Uh, I'm going to say "I" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of "he says blah, blah, blah," I'm going to say "I say, blah, blah, blah," but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, "He remembers Toby." [makes face] "I remember Toby." 
Dwight: Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar? 
Jim: Uh- 
Toby: It's the empanada guy. 
Jim: The empanada guy! 
Dwight: No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish] 
Ernesto: No. 
Nate: He says, "No." 
Dwight: He says, "No!" Boom! 
Andy: Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients. 
Dwight: Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish] 
Nate: Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets. 
Jim: Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them. 
Creed: Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink. 
Dwight: Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again? 
Andy: Why? Everybody's heard it. 
Dwight: Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning? 
Andy: Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there. 
Phyllis: Why? 
Andy: Why? Why? [looks at Jim] 
Jim: Because my car broke down. 
Andy: His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse. 
Dwight: Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse? 
Andy: Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that. 
Phyllis: [to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
 
Andy: We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down? 
Jim: Well, I think you handled it pretty well. 
Andy: I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep]. 
Jim: Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth. 
Andy: [sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
 
Oscar: Wow, it's so... healthy. 
Kevin: I'm going to call him Little Kevin. 
Angela: No, you will not. 
Erin: Is he really five pounds? 
Angela: Mm-hmm. 
Erin: Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that. 
Senator Lipton: No, no, no, he's nine pounds, seven ounces. 
Angela: Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring? 
Oscar: Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but- 
Senator Lipton: Well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you hit it out of the park. 
Angela: Aw, preemie pajamas! 
Oscar: Again, it may not be the right size. I can return- 
Angela: No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you. 
Kevin: I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
 
Oscar: This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
 
Jim: Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off. 
Stanley: What? 
Jim: Funny? No? Nobody laughing? 
Dwight: [laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening. 
Stanley: What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt. 
Jim: Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good. 
Dwight: Your clients. They're all mine. 
Darryl: Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse. 
Andy: Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die. 
Dwight: All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs] 
Andy: Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim. 
Dwight: No, no, no. You said- you said that you were- 
Andy: I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap] 
Dwight: That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
 
Gabe: [on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep] 
Dwight: Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
 
Dwight: I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
 
Angela: Shh. 
Oscar: Honestly, I can return this for a larger size. 
Angela: It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio. 
Oscar: The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate. 
Angela: Ah! 
Kevin: [giggles] Little Kevin. 
Angela: Really? 
Oscar: Angela. 
Angela: Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago. 
Oscar: I knew that, I knew it. 
Angela: The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata. 
Oscar: Chicken marsala. 
Angela: Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock. 
Oscar: Mm-hmm. 
Angela: And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
 
Oscar: Dwight. Hey. 
Dwight: Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe? 
Oscar: He went to the car or something, but he'll be back. 
Dwight: Okay. [sits] 
Oscar: Don't you want to see the baby? 
Dwight: Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now. 
Oscar: I promised I wouldn't tell. 
Dwight: So don't. 
Oscar: Angela got pregnant before the wedding. 
Dwight: What? 
Oscar: She got pregnant before the wedding. 
Dwight: How long before? 
Oscar: A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me! 
Dwight: Yes I did.
 
Angela: Dwight? 
Senator Lipton: Dwight. 
Dwight: I want to see the baby. 
Erin: Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it. 
Dwight: Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
 
Dwight: That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
 
Angela: He's hungry. 
Senator Lipton: Oh, that's my cue to leave. 
Angela: No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover. 
Senator Lipton: Still. Still. 
Angela: You won't see-
 
Jim: [to Cece] You want a giraffe?
 
Jim: Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam. 
Pam: Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here. 
Jim: Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face. 
Pam: Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you! 
Jim: Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think. 
Pam: Oh, hi Stanley. 
Jim: Split the difference? 
Pam: Jim. 
Jim: Okay, let's go.
 
Pam: Hey. 
Erin: Hi. 
Pam: Hi everybody! 
Jim: What? 
All: Hi. 
Pam: How about a little visit? 
Jim: Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers. 
Creed: Hey, Angela's back with her baby. 
Pam: Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip. 
Andy: Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does. 
Creed: Let me have a turn. 
Pam: No, it's the pacifier's turn. 
Creed: All right. 
Jim: Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people? 
Pam: [gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat. 
Phyllis: Cookies? 
Pam: No, but that would've been a really good idea. 
Jim: That was a great idea. 
Pam: No, she brought you drawings. 
Jim: Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy. 
Andy: Oh! 
Jim: Oh, Aunt Phyllis. 
Phyllis: Oh. 
Andy: Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these? 
Cece: No. 
Pam: She says "no" to everything. You know, she thinks my name is "No." Cece, do you want some broccoli? 
Cece: Yes. 
Pam: No. It's crazy. 
Ryan: Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to? 
Andy: There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old. 
Kelly: Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture? 
Cece: No. 
Kelly: So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture] 
Andy: Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style? 
Jim: You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right? 
Cece: [cries] Mama! 
Pam: Shh. 
Jim: I don't know what else we can do here. 
Cece: [cries] Mama, mama, mama. 
Jim: It's okay. 
Pam: Oh, it's okay, sweetie. 
Jim: All right, all right. Okay. 
Pam: It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay. 
Jim: All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this. 
Pam: Shh. 
Cece: Mama!
 
Dwight: Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me. 
Angela: Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby. 
Dwight: Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding? 
Angela: That is completely untrue. 
Dwight: Completely true. Remember? Angela. No. 
Dwight: You said that Robert was not fulfilling you- 
Angela: I did not. Uh-uh. 
Dwight: -and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "I'd like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls. 
Angela: That didn't happen. 
Dwight: And then I inserted my penis- 
Angela: No! Stop it! 
Dwight: Into your- 
Angela: Dwight. 
Dwight: Vagina and- 
Angela: And even if it did, it's just a coincidence. 
Dwight: Admit that there is a chance. 
Angela: I will not. 
Dwight: Admit it. Admit it. 
Angela: I will not, it's not- 
Senator Lipton: All done? 
Dwight: Yeah. 
Senator Lipton: Mmm. 
Angela: Yes, yes. He's sleeping. 
Dwight: Before I go, may I? 
Angela: Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
 
Dwight: Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision. 
Nurse: Who are you? 
Dwight: I just might be his father. 
Nurse: I don't know what that means. We're gonna circumcise him.
 
Jim: [Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out? 
Cece: No! 
Jim: Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything? 
Pam: I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier. 
Jim: Cece! 
Pam: Okay, we're going. 
Jim: Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud. 
Pam: Shh, shh, shh. 
Jim: I know, I know. 
Pam: You want to grab her? 
Jim: I'm gonna grab her, okay. 
Pam: Here we go, here we go. 
Jim: Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up. 
Stanley: [groans] We'll see you tomorrow. 
Jim: No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back. 
Phyllis: No, just go home. 
Darryl: It's all good, we got this.
 
Darryl: I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
 
Pam: Jim. 
Phyllis: Just go. 
Andy: Hey, we'll be just fine. 
Jim: Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go. 
Andy: Oh, whew!
 
Andy: Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here. 
Dwight: Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe. 
Gabe: You had something important to tell me? 
Dwight: Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
 
Dwight: Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
 
 
 Jim: Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty. 
Pam: Hey guys! 
All: Hey. 
Pam: [laughing] Hi. 
Andy: Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! 
Phyllis: Are you glad to be back? 
Pam: Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three. 
Stanley: You still had eight weeks more than we did. 
Pam: [laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation. 
Angela: Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi! 
Dwight: What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago. 
Angela: I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat] 
Pam: What?! 
Kelly: Damn girl! Your body! 
Oscar: Angela, you look amazing. 
Angela: Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars. 
Group: [murmurs of delight as people shuffle toward the treats] 
Pam: Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin? 
Kevin: Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it. 
Pam: Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too. 
Angela: I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here. 
Pam: When did you find time to do all this? 
Angela: Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam? 
Pam: Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good. 
Angela: I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh. 
Pam: So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So- 
Jim: Nope. It's over. 
Pam: ...we wanted to say thank you- 
Jim: Nope. OK.
 
Andy: Dwight, I have exciting news for you. 
Dwight: What? 
Andy: I think you're going to like it. 
Dwight: You can't tantalize me. 
Andy: Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that... 
Dwight: OK. [looks at watch and leaves] 
Andy: That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk. 
Dwight: If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear. 
Andy: No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores. 
Dwight: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
 
Dwight: The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, “perfect pork anus” which I don't mean.
 
Erin: And here's the fax for you. 
Andy: And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes. 
Erin: Ah! Love to learn. 
Andy: Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one. 
Erin: So... [points out their matching heart pins] 
Andy: Uh yeah, look at that. 
Erin: We're pin twins. 
Andy: Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later. 
Erin: Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
 
Erin: For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
 
Darryl: What do we have here?
 
Darryl: Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a “we're just friends” beanie or a “I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'” beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
 
Dwight: Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks. 
Pam: Really? 
Dwight: Mm hm. 
Pam: I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque. 
Jim: Ooh, me three. 
Dwight: Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill. 
Pam: Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about? 
Dwight: God, you're such a spy.
 
Darryl: [clears throat] Notice anything different about me? 
Val: You're wearing the beanie. You like it? 
Darryl: Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head. 
Nate: I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat. 
Darryl: [noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here. 
Val: I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for? 
Darryl: Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here. 
Nate: What? 
Darryl: Yeah. 
Nate: Darryl, you shouldn't have. 
Darryl: Hey. 
Nate: Can I open it? 
Darryl: No, no, no. Maybe just later. 
Nate: Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl. 
Val: Wow. Those are really nice. 
Nate: They're so elegant. 
Val: Cashmere. 
Nate: How'd you know? 
Darryl: Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way. 
Val: Can't wait. 
Nate: [reading card] “I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day.” Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
 
Dwight: My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name? 
Kathy: Kathy. 
Dwight: Kathy.
 
Jim: I just got a text from Robert California that says “bring your clubs to Florida”. 
Pam: Why? Does he think you're going to Florida? 
Jim: I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks? 
Pam: No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
 
Andy: You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar? 
Dwight: Yes. 
Andy: Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps? 
Dwight: Oh my god. 
Andy: They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find. 
Dwight: Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway. 
Andy: Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin. 
Dwight: Oh god. 
Andy: You have your team.
 
Dwight: Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
 
Pam: Well, let's hear it. 
Jim: “Robert, Hey!” Exclamation point. 
Pam: I like it so far. 
Jim: “Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA” Dash JH. 
Pam: It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida. 
Jim: Yeah, it's a golf text. 
Pam: Total golf text. Send it. 
Jim: Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him. 
Kelly: You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
 
Darryl: [on phone] This is Darryl. 
Bob: Oh, sorry I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse? I want to send my girlfriend some flowers. 
Darryl: Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val? 
Bob: Yeah, do you know her? 
Darryl: We're friends. We're friends. 
Bob: Cool. Um, so can I get that address or...? 
Darryl: Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen. 
Bob: Why do you need a pen? 
Darryl: Back off! I got my reasons.
 
Dwight: May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately? 
Kelly: Why? 
Dwight: Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida. 
Kelly: Hell yeah. 
Stanley: What?! 
Dwight: Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you. 
Meredith: Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back. 
Oscar: It just feels like a slap in the face. 
Dwight: I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons. 
Oscar: We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are. 
Dwight: I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime. 
Kevin: Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape. 
Dwight: Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan. 
Ryan: What are the criteria for going? 
Dwight: It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you. 
Andy: Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs] 
Dwight: Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify? 
Andy: Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that. 
Stanley: Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson. 
Kevin: Hey! 
Angela: Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office. 
Kelly: Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch. 
Angela: My baby is not a monster! 
Dwight: Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby. 
Andy: Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys! 
Ryan: Stop calling us “guys”.
 
Andy: I use the word “guys” a lot when I'm nervous...guys.
 
Andy: Guys! Guys! Guys! 
Group: Stop it! 
Andy: Guys.. 
Ryan: Stop. Stop it Andy. 
Oscar: ...Andy. 
Andy: Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me. 
Dwight: OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered. 
Andy: Wha- 
Stanley: If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice. 
Andy: OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out. 
Dwight: Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it. 
Andy: No. That is a ridiculous waste of time. 
Kelly: For you maybe. 
Andy: Five to six hours? 
Dwight: Three to four hours. 
Andy: No no no no. 
Dwight: Two to three hours... 
Andy: Nope. 
Dwight: Come up with a statement in the next hour.... 
Andy: Thirty minutes! 
Creed: I'm out.
 
Pam: Ok, read it back to me. 
Jim: [reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets. 
Pam: Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact. 
Erin: Absolutely. Works for me. 
Jim: Ok, sending. 
Pam: Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning. 
Jim: Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L. 
Erin: [laughs exaggeratedly]
 
Phyllis: I have a new swimsuit I need to break in.... 
Meredith: I am... 
Dwight: I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
 
Ryan: You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there. 
Andy: Or both? 
Ryan: Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks. 
Andy: Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that. 
Dwight: Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
 
Kevin: Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something... 
Dwight: Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know. 
Andy: Thank you. 
Kevin: When do we leave? 
Andy: Thank you.
 
Toby: It has been a long, lonely winter. 
Dwight: Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby. 
Toby: It is real, thank you for saying that. 
Andy: Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?
 
Stanley: Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
 
Dwight: Maybe it's what she does here... 
Andy: Well... 
Erin: Hey guys, any spots left? 
Andy: Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee? 
Erin: I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head. 
Dwight: You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality. 
Erin: Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go. 
Andy: Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in.. 
Erin: Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
 
Jim: Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation? 
Pam: I think you need to go to Florida. 
Jim: I think you're right. 
Pam: It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be.. 
Jim: Total nightmare. 
Pam: I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need? 
Jim: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone. 
Pam: Exactly.
 
Dwight: Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy? 
Andy: Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go. 
Dwight: I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much. 
Jim: You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go. 
Dwight: Jim is essential to th- 
Jim: Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone] 
Dwight: Andy, Jim is just too...essen-... 
Jim: Essential. 
Dwight: This is stupid! Cut. 
Jim: Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks. 
Dwight: He doesn't even want to go. 
Jim: Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates. 
Dwight: Oh my god. 
Jim: Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
 
Andy: OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy.. 
Dwight: What? 
Andy: ….Stanley.. 
Dwight: No. 
Andy: ...Ryan... 
Dwight: No! 
Andy: ...Erin... 
Dwight: (Bleep) 
Andy: ...And, Jim. 
Dwight: You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
 
Dwight: Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move. 
Stanley: Why is it so hot in here? 
Dwight: Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead. 
Ryan: But... 
Dwight: But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here? 
Ryan: No no, I want to go. 
Dwight: Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer] 
Jim: Is that the buzzer from Taboo? 
Dwight: SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
 
Dwight: How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance? 
Stanley: How did a mosquito get in here?
 
Dwight: I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
 
Dwight: Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says “I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt” unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that? 
Jim: Mosquito. 
Dwight: [Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.
 
Nate: Oh Darryl, hey. 
Darryl: Hey what's up? You called? 
Nate: Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything... 
Darryl: It's cool really. 
Nate: No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper] 
Darryl: “This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack” 
Nate: Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you. 
Darryl: Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers. 
Val: Thanks, they're from my mom. 
Darryl: Your mom? 
Val: Yeah. 
Darryl: Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman? 
Val: Yeah, that's her. 
Darryl: She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon? 
Val: [laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon.
 
Darryl: Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
 
Dwight: Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.
 
Erin: I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
 
Dwight: So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate. 
Jim: So, what is this special project? 
Dwight: Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store. 
Jim: That sounds awesome. 
Dwight: It did, it did. 
Ryan: You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it. 
Erin: Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it. 
Dwight: Oh, I like it. 
Ryan: It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party? 
Dwight: No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store. 
Ryan: Right. Think different, from Apple. 
Jim: Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us? 
Dwight: [long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
 
Dwight: I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
 
Kelly: I don't know how I'm going to live here without you. 
Ryan: Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there. 
Kelly: Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you. 
Ryan: No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
 
Pam: Alright [kiss] 
Jim: Bye. 
Pam: Bye. Call me when you land. 
Jim: I will. 
Andy: Safe travels. 
Erin: Goodbye for a very very long time. 
Andy: Oh, K. It's only three weeks.
 
Kathy: [On phone] All expenses paid. Yeah, Jim's gonna be there. Their marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me. Definitely we will. It's three weeks in Tallahassee, what else is there to do?

Dwight: Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
 
Dwight: Wake up! [Cathy screams]
 
Dwight: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way? 
Erin: Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
 
Dwight: Stanley! Wake up! You’ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire! 
Erin: Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth] 
Stanley: Mmm! [struggles] Ugh! 
Dwight: [lets go] Good morning.
 
Erin: Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now. 
Ryan: Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
 
Jim: I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides] 
Dwight: Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man. 
Erin: What do you think happened? 
Dwight: Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees "IT WAS DWIGHT" written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]
 
Jim: Puppet. 
Cathy: Cool, for your kids? 
Jim: Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before. 
Dwight: Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
 
Dwight: I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
 
Dwight: I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel. 
Saleswoman: What does he like? 
Dwight: Power.
 
Ryan: Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't see too many museums around here." 
Dwight: Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car. 
Erin: Hey, are you okay? 
Dwight: I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming. 
Erin: Who says none of us are diarrheal? 
Jim: Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you. 
Dwight: Very funny, Jim. 
Jim: Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something? 
Dwight: I'm gonna set your face on fire. 
Jim: That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub? 
Stanley: Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod. 
Jim: Yes. 
Stanley: You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins. 
Jim: Loggins and Messina. 
Stanley: Did I say "Messina?" [tires screech]
 
Andy: Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet. 
Creed: I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today. 
Andy: It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler. 
Darryl: I loved it. 
Meredith: Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet. 
Andy: Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it. 
Oscar: Can we see that? Did you really find it? 
Andy: Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash. 
Pam: Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail. 
Everyone: Oh great. [overlapping chatter] 
Kelly: We're screwed. 
Pam: There. [phone rings] 
Andy: Oh! There we go! Pam? 
Pam: Yeah? 
Andy: Can you get the phone? 
Pam: Well I'm not the receptionist. 
Andy: Mm, well, you used to be. 
Pam: I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do. 
Andy: Phone's ringing. 
Kelly: Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone! 
Everyone: Somebody! Answer the phone. 
Kelly: Andy, pick up the phone! 
Stanley: Get the damn phone. 
Meredith: You're the closest one to it. 
Andy: Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
 
Jim: Man. 
Cathy: How was the drive? 
Jim: Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast. 
Stanley: Life is short. "Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse." That's one of my mottoes. 
Jim: I would love to hear the other mottos.
 
Packer: Quick query, Halpert. 
Jim: No way. 
Packer: Still queer? 
Dwight: Packer. 
Packer: You can't put me down. Too strong!
 
Packer: Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-
 
Nellie: Psst. Say, "So who's leading this thing, anyway?" 
Ryan: So who's leading this thing, anyway? 
Nellie: Psst. Say, "I can't wait to meet him." 
Ryan: I can't wait to meet him. 
Nellie: Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader? 
Ryan: I- 
Nellie: You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't "a good fit-" 
Jim: It was- 
Nellie: Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, "Yes!" So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like? 
Cathy: Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one. 
Nellie: No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic. 
Cathy: Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter. 
Nellie: Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it. 
Erin: Yeah! 
Nellie: Let me just get the projector working. 
Dwight: Uh. [eats antacids] 
Jim: You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote. 
Dwight: You didn't poison me, it's just stress. 
Jim: Okay. 
Dwight: What is the antidote? 
Jim: True love's kiss. 
Nellie: Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon. 
Dwight: I'll do it! I always say, "You want something done right? Ask Dwight." Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers] 
Packer: I can do it. 
Dwight: Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
 
Dwight: [on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use? 
Jim: Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding. 
Dwight: Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed. 
Nellie: Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks] 
Emergency Operator: Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance? 
Dwight: Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
 
Packer: I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time. 
Nellie: Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual. 
Packer: Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense. 
Dwight: You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter. 
Packer: Did you say "masturbator?" 
Dwight: I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter. 
Nellie: Why are you sitting down like that? 
Dwight: Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
 
Jim: Wow. Are you that bored? 
Stanley: It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate. 
Jim: Is that another motto? 
Stanley: It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle] 
Jim: Mmm. 
Stanley: Or do you only drink with your kids? 
Jim: Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
 
Jim: I've spent so much of my life telling myself "Please, don't end up like Stanley," and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
 
Nellie: We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm? 
Packer: Yup. Tallahassee, let's go. 
Erin: Jim, are you in? 
Jim: Oh, I don't know. 
Stanley: Sounds like a hoot. I'm in. 
Jim: All right, what the heck? Let's do it. 
Packer: This is great. This is gonna be great. 
Nellie: I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt. 
Dwight: I'll be on top. It's the most important position. 
Ryan: Dude, I think you have appendicitis. 
Dwight: [tries to climb human pyramid] Ahh! 
Ryan: Dwight? 
Jim: Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while? 
Dwight: Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit! 
Packer: Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen. 
Dwight: [groans] Stop moving! 
Jim: No one's moving! 
Dwight: Oh! [collapses] 
Everyone: Oh, oh! [general commotion]
 
Dwight: Arrest Jim. He poisoned me. 
Jim: Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
 
Jim: The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty. 
Paramedic: You need an operation. You have appendicitis. 
Ryan: Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net. 
Erin: How long will he be gone? 
Paramedic: Two or three days. 
Dwight: Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen. 
Packer: Drama queen, am I right? 
Dwight: [to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up. 
Packer: That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?
 
Pam: Whoa, are those mini pizzas? 
Andy: Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck. 
Kevin: Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge. 
Andy: Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through. 
Darryl: Oh [bleep] yeah. 
Andy: Up high. 
Darryl: Yes sir. Thanks. 
Andy: Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out. 
Creed: Ah, Dwell. 
Andy: I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone!
 
Dwight: I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in. 
Erin: Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later. 
Dwight: Who's doing the presentations? 
Erin: Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess. 
Dwight: Damn it! 
Erin: Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
 
Packer: -features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty. 
Nellie: Very good point. 
Dwight: Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting. 
Nellie: Dwight, are you all right? 
Dwight: I'm great. How are you?
 
Dwight: What's our presentation about? 
Jim: Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours. 
Dwight: I got the surgery, what else is there to do? 
Erin: Do a hundred jumping jacks. 
Dwight: No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks. 
Erin: I don't feel like it either!
 
Erin: [doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
 
Dwight: I want that vice-presidency. 
Jim: You haven't done any of the research. 
Dwight: "You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name." You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it. 
Stanley: Aw, let him do it. 
Jim: Stanley, are you listening to music? 
Stanley: Yup. 
Dwight: All right, who's ready for the next presentation? 
Nellie: Ah, what is your topic? 
Dwight: What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is. 
Erin: Retail consumer habits. 
Dwight: Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
 
Dwight: Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean? 
Ryan: I can field this one. 
Dwight: No, sit down. "Seasonal." Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.
 
Andy: Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt. 
Kevin: Are those the lyrics?
 
Dwight: Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions? 
Nellie: What are the three pillars of retail? 
Erin: [whispers] Convenience. 
Dwight: Ingredients. 
Erin: Service. 
Dwight: Burgers. 
Erin: Building loyalty. 
Dwight: Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters. 
Nellie: Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight. 
Dwight: Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim? 
Jim: You are bleeding through your shirt. 
Dwight: Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.
 
Pam: Hey, having fun? 
Andy: Yes I am, as a matter of fact. 
Pam: Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here? 
Andy: I found my calling. 
Darryl: Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog. 
Pam: Guys, I don't like this analogy. 
Andy: [groans] Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? [points to pens in cup] 
Pam: It's nice. 
Andy: I mean... [Pam giggles]
 
Nellie: How are you feeling? 
Dwight: Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle. 
Nellie: Can I see the wound? 
Dwight: [show her the wound] Oh God. 
Nellie: Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed. 
Dwight: You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass. 
Nellie: A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet. 
Dwight: That's right. 
Nellie: That is amazing. Todd, look at that. 
Packer: Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound] 
Dwight: Ah! Not so fast. 
Nellie: Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer. 
Packer: It would be an honor, ma'am. 
Dwight: I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
 
Dwight: I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
 
Andy: [answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew. 
Donna Muraski: Hi Andrew. What happened to Erin? 
Andy: Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks. 
Donna Muraski: Oh, good for her. She's such a sweetheart. You tell her Donna Muraski misses her. 
Andy: I miss her too.
 
Nellie: Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies. [cheers, claps] 
Wally Amos: Aloha, aloha, aloha. So I hear you're all looking to bake up some dough in the sales game. Well, back when I was regular Amos- 
Stanley: What's under the cloth? 
Wally Amos: We'll get to that. 
Packer: Cookies. Bet you anything it’s cookies. 
Wally Amos: It's cookies. Let me- let me finish my speech first. 
Nellie: Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies] 
Erin: Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I- 
Wally Amos: Is it oatmeal with no raisins? 
Erin: I'm sorry to have wasted your time.


Pam: Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us? 
Angela: So cute. 
Oscar: Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
 
Pam: Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby. 
Angela: News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid. 
Pam: Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course. 
Angela: That is where we disagree.
 
Oscar: Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet? 
Pam: No, three-month-old humans don't do that. 
Angela: My Phillip is crawling.
 
Pam: Angela is such a liar! 
Oscar: It's maddening!
 
Oscar: Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long. 
Pam: Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
 
Angela: No one said "you must have two" 
Oscar: Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no. 
Angela: No thank you.
 
Andy: [laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat…am i right?
 
Angela/Pam: Unbelievable! 
Oscar: Un-be-liev-a-ble.
 
Nellie: It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it? 
Packer: That's great. 
Dwight: Pretty good. 
Nellie: Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP. 
Dwight: [laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. 
Nellie: I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more. 
Dwight: Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or- 
Jim: Catching butterflies. 
Dwight: That's a hobby, unless it's for food. 
Jim: Theater. 
Dwight: Waste of time. 
Jim: Dragging. 
Dwight: That's just a verb. 
Jim: Dragging sticks. 
Dwight: Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks. 
Nellie: Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just… you three, no. 
Packer: Not good enough (clicks tongue)
 
Dwight: English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.
 
Nellie: Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory. 
Packer: I'll be there at 6:00 
Cathy: Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about. 
Jim: 'Talla-nasty', very clever. 
Cathy: Thank you- 
Gabe: Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no…
 
Jim: Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon. 
Stanley: My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
 
Andy: Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins! 
Pam: Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go! 
Andy: Say what? 
Pam: We are good to goooo! 
Andy: Say what? 
Pam: We're good to goooo! 
Angela: Stop it. 
Andy: Say- 
Angela: Stop it. 
Oscar: Andy.
 
Andy: Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip. 
Pam: Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball. 
Andy: …ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
 
Packer: Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass. 
Nellie: Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him. 
Dwight: Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children … What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder) 
Packer: Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips. 
Dwight: That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback. 
Gabe: What happens if you're the hunchback? 
Dwight: Oh, you get kicked. 
Jim: How many buttons do you have? 
Dwight: (takes out bag) 40. Always. 
Cathy: Can I see? 
Dwight: Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy) 
Cathy: So, I get to kick you now. 
Dwight: No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you. 
Cathy: Well, that's how I played it in college. 
Jim: College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight) 
Dwight: Aah! 
Packer: Aaaaand he host at his own lame game. 
Nellie: Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit. 
Packer: Thank you. 
(Dwight looks on angrily)
 
Ryan: I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please. 
Erin: And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup. 
Waitress: Sorry, no waffles. 
Erin: Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it. 
Ryan: A waffle? 
Erin: A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy? 
Ryan: No. 
Erin: I'm moving down here, you know. 
Ryan: Oh, no, I didn't know. 
Erin: I'm young, and I can … and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young. 
Ryan: You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
 
Ryan: Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey. 
Erin: Hey.
 
Pam: Watson carpet and tile. 
Kevin: One order. 
Oscar: Order reference number 00983-126. 
Phyllis: Eight Cases, bright white inkjet. 
Angela: Paid. 
Kelly: I'm dying! 
Darryl: Processed. 
Val: And delivered.
 
Kelly: Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
 
Nellie: I will be right back. 
Packer: I will be here. 
Dwight: Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine. 
Packer: Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies] 
Dwight: Well, saddles… [clicks tongue, whinnies] … sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth. 
Packer: What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.
 
Dwight: If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
 
Andy: Who is ready for dinner? "oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid". No. [claps] I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves… [takes foil off tray] [Jamaican accent] A Jamaican feast, mon! 
[Disapproval from everyone else] 
Phyllis: If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there. 
Andy: Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf! 
Val: Hey. 
Brandon: How you doing, Val? [Val and Brandon kiss] 
Oscar: Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff. 
Brandon: Oh no, I'm not actually Jamaican. 
Oscar: Terrific. 
Darryl: What's up man? I'm Darryl. 
Brandon: Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good? 
Darryl: Oh yeah. 
Brandon: Must be doing real good since you're f***ing my girlfriend. 
Everyone: Whoa. 
Kevin: Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five! 
Darryl: I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend. 
Val: Brandon, what the hell are you talking about? 
Brandon: Don't play dumb with me. I know what's up. 
Val: Honey, I am not sleeping with- 
Andy: Heyyy… let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops! 
Brandon: Hope you all like goat. 
Andy: Goat…
 
Nellie: Blow in my ear. 
Packer: Alright. 
Nellie: Like I'm on the beach. 
[Packer blows in Nellie's ear] 
Dwight: [imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls] 
Nellie: And a wave crashing… a wave crashing. 
[Packer and Dwight imitate waves] 
Nellie: Oh, that is lovely. 
Jim: Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
 
[Cathy knocks on Jim's door and Jim answers] 
Jim: Hey, how's it going? 
Cathy: Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here? 
Jim: Uh… yeah, I'm just watching basketball. 
Cathy: Okay, yeah. 
Jim: Okay. 
Cathy: Cool… [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness. 
Jim: Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in… March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so… [sits on floor] 
Cathy: LeBron James. 
Jim: Yes, nice. Good word association 
Cathy: [giggles] 
[Cathy walks over to mini fridge and bends over to take something out. Jim looks away]
 
[Packer takes string out of his mouth] 
Nellie: Impressive. 
Dwight: Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
 
Andy: Thornwood Wholesalers. 
Kevin: One order. 
Brandon: I read the text you sent to Val, man. 
Val: That's messed up. 
Angela: Is this spicy? 
Brandon: No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn't find anything, but I did, so- 
Andy: I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something. 
Brandon: At midnight? 
Andy: … yeah… 
Kevin: It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery… 
Kelly: Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here. 
Andy: Thank you. 
Kelly: I thin we're gonna need to here those texts. 
Andy: Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before? 
Kelly: No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
 
[Knock at the door] 
Jim: Yup, coming. [opens door] All right. 
Stanley: My mini bar is oddly out of rum. 
Jim: We have plenty. 
Stanley: Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy] 
Jim: Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game. 
Stanley: Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier. 
Jim: No, no, no, Stanley. 
Stanley: mm-hmm. [about to leave] 
Jim: Stanley. Stanley. 
Stanley: uh-huh. 
Jim: Stanley. Uhh… you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
 
Erin: Whoa. the lights are still on. 
Ryan: Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off. 
Erin: I like how guys just know stuff all the time. 
Ryan: Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me. 
Erin: [gasps] Hello, waffle iron. 
Ryan: Hello, what do we have here? 
Erin: Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl… 
Ryan: Right. 
Erin: … a measuring cup… 
Ryan: Got that. [Metallic thud] Get down. 
Erin: [whispers] It's the fuzz! 
Ryan: [whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
 
Darryl: "I got too much ice cream. You want some?" "Getting' my fry on." 
Kelly: Boring. 
Darryl: Uh, "The moon is huge tonight." 
Phyllis: Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry. 
Darryl: That's regular text talk. 
Brandon: You forgot one. 
Darryl: "You're such a great friend." 
Brandon: With the dots. 
Darryl: "You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot." 
Kelly: Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means "Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. 
Everyone: Oh… 
Brandon: See? Yes. Thank you, sister. 
Val: Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right? 
Darryl: Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
 
Nellie: You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit. 
Dwight: You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] …ahhmmm… excuse me… What?! Not now, I'm busy. 
Jim: [on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt. 
Dwight: Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no… Freak, I need a favor. 
Gabe: Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis. 
Dwight: I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie. 
Gabe: What's in it for GSL? 
Dwight: You really want Packer as your boss? 
Gabe: Got it.
 
Dwight: If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
 
Dwight: Where did you see it? 
Jim: In the bed. 
Cathy: I haven't seen anything. 
Dwight: We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed] 
Cathy: Jeez… 
Dwight: Describe it. 
Jim: Brown, shiny, painful bite. 
Dwight: Could be a bat weevil… Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy? 
Jim: Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation. 
Dwight: Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured? 
Jim: So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this. 
Dwight: Pshh. That's a bedbug. 
Jim: Yeah. 
Dwight: Everything's a joke. 
Jim: I know. 
Dwight: Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair] 
Jim: Ow. 
Dwight: God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this. 
Jim: Just check it. 
Dwight: You are clean. Okay… One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh] 
Jim: Alright. 
Dwight: Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me! 
Cathy: Is this really nessecary? 
Jim: He knows what he's doing. 
Dwight: Let the bedbugs bite! 
Cathy: Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower. 
Jim: Alright, then I will catch you later… What do we do now? 
Dwight: We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa. 
Jim: Oh.
 
[Packer and Nellie are speaking softly to each other. Gabe sprays his inhaler into Packer's drink.] 
Jim: I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again. 
Dwight: Nope, I wasn't bitten. 
Jim: Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here. 
Dwight: Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect. 
Jim: Come on. 
Dwight: If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me. 
Jim: You know what? Maybe they just ate. 
Dwight: No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long. 
Jim: Okay, they're fine. They're adults. 
Dwight: No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first. 
Jim: Is that really how you want to get this job? 
Dwight: Such a chorus girl. 
Jim: Okay, Dwight… Dwight… Dwight, Dwight Dwight!… uh… 
Cathy: [in a bathrobe] Is crazy gone? 
[Jim does his signature face]
 
[Nellie and Packer are dancing. Gabe winks at Dwight. Packer pukes all over Gabe's slacks and walks off.] 
Nellie: Oh! 
Gabe: They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore! 
Dwight: Euughh… Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present… Hey.
 
Cathy: Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster… Okay, cool. Thanks… I know, I'm a pig, right? 
Jim: Hmm? No. 
Cathy: [giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously. 
Jim: Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married. 
Cathy: Oh my God, what are you thinking? 
Jim: um… I mean- 
Cathy: I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me? 
Jim: I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching. 
Cathy: Can you… without running to the other side of the room all night? 
Jim: Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just… we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care. 
Cathy: Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold. 
Jim: [Jim Face]
 
Pam: Hey, Darryl. You okay? 
Darryl: She's got a boyfriend. 
Andy: Play it cool, man. She'll come around. 
Pam: No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there. 
Andy: Yeah, but… My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool. 
Pam: My husband would tell you to go for it.
 
Ryan: Hey. 
Erin: Hey. 
Ryan: Hey. 
Erin: Hey. 
Ryan: Hey, this is fun. 
Erin: A lot of fun. 
Ryan: I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day. 
Erin: You should move down here with me. 
Ryan: Yeah? 
Erin: We could be roommates. 
Ryan: Really? 
Erin: We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl- 
Ryan: Yeah. 
Erin: Maybe in six months- 
Ryan: [louder] Six months?… um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
 
Nellie: Put your forehead near mine, and see if you can read my thoughts. 
Dwight: Okay… Seven, one, one, nine… 
Nellie: No, no, no, not numbers, no. 
Dwight: No, okay. 
Nellie: No. 
Dwight: Try again… Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one… is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay? 
Nellie: Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time. 
Dwight: [gasps]Wait, the numbers! 
Nellie: Mm-hmm. 
Dwight: oh… 
Nellie: mm-hmm… 
Dwight: There you go. 
Nellie: I will see you in seven- 
Dwight: Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]… Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie] 
Dwight: [in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
 
Angela: 1434-967, paid. 
Darryl: It has been processed. 
Val: It has been delivered. 
Pam: That's it, last one. 
[Everyone applauds] 
Kelly: Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic. 
Andy: Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee… 
Phyllis: No way. 
Andy: I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion… 
Val: Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again? 
Darryl: Sure. 
Val: Okay, thanks. 
Darryl: Hey, just so you know, me and you… I don't think that's ridiculous… Dot, dot, dot… dot, dot.
 
[Jim walks into his room to find a bathrobe on the floor] 
Jim: All right. Now I think it's time for you to go. 
Cathy: What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right? 
Jim: Cathy, go. 
Dwight: [wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug? 
Jim: Awesome. 
Dwight: [sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back! 
Cathy: Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?! 
Dwight: [continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart! 
Cathy: [coughs and moans] 
Jim: Right there! [points to Cathy] 
Cathy: Oh stop it, stop it, stop it! 
Jim: [coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one! 
Cathy: I can't breathe! 
Dwight: I think I saw it! 
Cathy: Stop it! [runs out the door] 
Jim: Nice job, I think you got 'em. 
Dwight: You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy. 
Jim: [Jim face]
 
Dwight: Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had. 
Jim: Oh yeah? What's the first best? 
Nellie: [at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight? 
Jim: [whispers] Is that Nellie? 
Dwight: [whispers] Don't let-shh! 
Nellie: Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? [knocks] [Dwight turns off the lights] Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? [knocks] Dwight? [whispers] Dwight. [Dwight eats his Bananas Foster]


Dwight: Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine. 
Ryan: Are you holding this chair? 
Dwight: Yes. 
Ryan: ‘cause I feel like I’m gonna fall off. 
Dwight: Yes. Yes. 
Ryan: I’m not wearing the right shoes for this. 
Dwight: We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots. 
Erin: Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
 
Erin: Hey, my name’s Tabitha. I’m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It’s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it’s working. There’s already people camped out behind me.
 
Nellie: Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I’m this patrician goddess. But here’s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than … what’s lower than dirt? 
Dwight: Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core. 
Nellie: Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn’t even get a callback. 
Jim: Which Spice Girl? 
Nellie: The black one. I never stood a chance. 
Jim: Okay. 
Nellie: Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey. 
Dwight: Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much. 
Todd Packer: Yep 
Dwight: Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing – bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You’re gonna love ‘em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world’s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this? 
Ryan: When people see this presentation, they’re gonna [bleep] in their pants. 
Dwight: Okay. 
Jim: Come on, man. 
Cathy: Seriously disgusting. 
Dwight: Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers. 
Cathy: Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea. 
Dwight: Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
 
Todd Packer: Uh… 
Nellie: Uh… that is excellent. 
Todd Packer: I don’t see what that gets us, but I’m a team player. 
Dwight: Perfect casting, right?
 
Todd Packer: Schrute’s out to get me. But I’m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
 
Nellie: I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples. 
Dwight: Speaking of pimples, let’s release the BLOGGERS!
 
Andy: Morning, everyone. 
Kevin: Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning? 
Andy: Don’t care. Tell me later. 
Kevin: Listen, it’s important. You’ve gotta hear this. 
Andy: What do you got? 
Kelly: Oh, my god! 
Phyllis: Do you have a black eye? 
Andy: Yes, I do. Phyllis. 
Kevin: I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what? 
Andy: What? 
Kevin: It’s not a kid on a bike. It’s a man in a car. 
Darryl: Andy, who punched you? 
Meredith: Hey, I was on the can. What’s this about a black guy in the office? 
Angela: Black eye, Meredith. 
Kelly: Will someone please explain what’s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it’s like my life is buffering. 
Andy: Here’s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam… 
Pam: That’s true. 
Andy: They had, uh… weapons. 
Pam: Weapons. 
Andy: I just stepped in to talk some sense into them. 
Pam: But these were not the kind of people who use their words. 
Andy: Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime. 
Pam: Thank goodness he was there. 
Oscar: Good job Andy. 
Kevin: Yeah [all murmuring] 
Andy: I didn’t do anything any of you wouldn’t have done.
 
Dwight: Open the gates! There’s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There’s plenty for everyone! 
Man: Quit it. 
Dwight: There’s plenty. Don’t stampede. No need to stampede, sir. 
Erin: I was ahead of you! 
Dwight: Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It’s gonna be fine. It’s gonna be fine. There’s plenty of Pyramids. 
Erin: Come on. I was in line before you.
 
Cathy: So you’re a blogger right? 
Blogger: Yeah. Blogger. 
Cathy: God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I’m trying to be a good girl for once.
 
Erin: Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don’t want to leave yet. I haven’t had so much fun since seeing… zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
 
Oscar: How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now! 
Andy: No. 
Angela: Yes. 
Andy: No, no, no, no, no, we don’t need to call the police. They’ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone’s business, right, Pam? 
Pam: Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street. 
Andy: And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area. 
Angela: Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood? 
Andy: Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5. 
Pam: 1-8-5-0-5. 
Darryl: Guys, guys. That’s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7. 
Phyllis: Look, I don’t feel safe. I think we should call the police. 
Angela: Yes. 
Andy: Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why… Toby is giving us self defense training. 
Toby: Me? 
Andy: Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense? 
Toby: Yeah, um... I can’t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I’ll go put on my cup. 
Andy: Great.
 
Nellie: Yes! 
Blogger: Okay. 
Nellie: I wasn’t really sure which one of you is Chuck. 
Jim: [on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl? 
Blogger: Look at that guy. He’s got his Sabre phone on, and he’s not even using it. 
Blogger 2: This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog. 
Jim: Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay. 
Nellie: Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad. 
Dwight: Oh, no, no, no. It’s good. It’s really -- on the Internet, it’s a really -- that’s a really good, good, thing.
 
Dwight: Are you trying to sabotage this entire event? 
Jim: I’m very sorry. 
Nellie: We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? “Hello. Hi sweetie. It’s Jim. I’m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.” 
Jim: I’m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck? 
Dwight: You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
 
Dwight: Point it towards the store, idiot!
 
Dwight: [laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
 
Dwight: Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here! 
Erin: We are closed! Come on.
 
Toby: Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let’s try it. 
Creed: [smacks Meredith’s head] [screams] [runs out] 
Meredith: Ow. 
Toby: That may have been my fault. 
Meredith: What the hell, Toby? 
Toby: Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you’re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. “It’s all about the groin.” 
Andy: What if you’re being attacked by a … smallish man who happens to not have a groin? 
Toby: I don’t think that’s very common. 
Andy: What if you’re being attacked by a 4’11” man who is penisless? 
Oscar: Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker? 
Andy: Why don’t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man. 
Toby: Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female. 
Andy: So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself? 
Toby: It’s interesting that you’re drawn to the point of view of the attacker.  You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu. 
Angela: Can I please leave? I have a rape flute. 
Toby: All right, well, let’s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn’t everyone stand? Okay, so... you’re being attacked. You’ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two. 
Everyone: One, two. 
Andy: [softly] Take that, kid.
 
Dwight: Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine. 
Lady Blogger: Patty Grossman. I’m a woman. 
Dwight: But you still work for Wired, right? 
Patty: Yes. 
Dwight: Good! Okay. Flirt away.
 
Ryan: Sabre. It’s time to come home. 
Jim: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous. 
Ryan: Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it? 
Dwight: Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen. 
Ryan: You know what? 
Dwight: You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea. 
Jim: Dwight. 
Dwight: I’m trying to make him feel important. 
Ryan: God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say. 
Dwight: Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you’re so smart. You’re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee. 
Ryan: You’re so ignorant. You barely know what you’re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books. 
Dwight: What’s a book? [giggles] 
Ryan: On my God. You’re so embarrassing.  My mom would say the best stuff, though. 
Jim: [ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan. 
Ryan: And you know that I’m capable of this. 
Jim: You’re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie. 
Ryan: What did you think of the presentation? 
Jim: I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one -- 
Ryan: Oh! “Fix” means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink! 
Dwight: Jim, get him a water. 
Ryan: No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red! 
Dwight: Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
 
Toby: Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you’re alive. 
Lady: Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice? 
Andy: [deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office. 
Girl: That’s him... the guy I hit. 
Darryl: What? 
Oscar: You’ve gotta be kidding me. 
Kevin: Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass? 
Oscar: No, Kevin -- [sighs] 
Lady: What about the lady you hit with the pine cone? 
Girl: There. That chubby one. 
Pam: I just had a baby. 
Girl: Yesterday? 
Pam: Wow. 
Lady: Apologize. 
Girl: Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your “thin” girlfriend. 
Pam: How ‘bout we wait til next year after you have your kid? 
Lady: You know what? Tiffy’s going to college. 
Andy: [deep voice] Listen, I don’t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I’ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day. 
Lady: God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye. 
Kevin: Bye. 
Kelly: So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- “How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.” 
Toby: There’s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me. 
Kelly: No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere. 
Darryl: Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop. 
Andy: Oh... [Kelly laughing]
 
Dwight: Have you seen Erin? 
Stanley: I’m on break. 
Dwight: Oh God...  Hey no! Where do you think you’re going? You’ve gotta stay for the big presentation we’ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He’s like an even more handsome Bill Gates. 
Blogger: When’s the presentation? 
Dwight: It’s moments away. Just stay here!
 
Ryan: [on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it’s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it’s different because it’s your wife?  Well, that doesn’t make any sense to me. 
Nellie: How you doing? 
Ryan: Don’t talk to me right now. I’m sorry. I- I know you’re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don’t understand is... [voice fades] 
Nellie: [to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
 
Erin: Sorry about kicking you out. It’s just, we don’t want our brand associated with death. 
Old Lady: It’s okay. I’ll go to the Costco and search for handsome men. 
Erin: You’re not married yet? 
Old Lady: [laughs] Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away. 
Erin: My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we’re not really friends. 
Old Lady: Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him! 
Erin: Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband. 
Old Lady: Well...
 
Dwight: How long has he been in the bathroom? 
Jim: About ten minutes. 
Dwight: Jeez! What’s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates] 
Jim: Oops, that’s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out? 
Dwight: Are there any bloggers around? 
Jim: It’s Ryan. “I’m sorry. I lied. I’m not in the bathroom. I can’t do it. I need to see my mom. I’m going home.” 
Nellie: What is the delay here? Where’s Ryan? Why is he not here? 
Dwight: I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy! 
Jim: Uh... 
Nellie: What? 
Dwight: That’s right. Will you just give us a second? 
Nellie: You are gonna bloody ruin it. You’re gonna bloody ruin it because you’re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed... 
Jim: okay. 
Nellie: That’s.... 
Dwight: Jim -- 
Jim: I’m not doing the Presentation. 
Dwight: Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I’m telling you... if you don’t do this, [whispers] I don’t stand a chance. Please, Jim. 
Jim: Okay, I’ll do it. 
Dwight: Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan’s costume and check out his notes. 
Jim: A costume? 
Dwight: Of course there’s a costume! [laughs]  Oh, this is gonna be great. There’s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
 
Dwight: Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long? 
Jim: I’ve been in here for 20 seconds. 
Dwight: Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner? 
Jim: I’m not wearing eyeliner. 
Dwight: You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
 
[Coldplay’s Clocks] 
Jim: Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that’s -- 
Dwight: It’s true. 
Jim: This... is the future, because... This is the past. I’ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I’ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I’ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause] 
Dwight: Yep. 
Jim: When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me.  I just wanted... to go home.  This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013.  You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space. 
Crowd: ahhhhhh 
Dwight: Psst. 
Jim: Oh. 
Ryan: [image on Pyramid] Sabre... It’s time... to come home. 
Crowd: [applause] 
Jim: All right.  Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues] 
Jim: Yeah.  Thank you. Thank you.
 
Toby: Okay, this isn’t over. Let’s stay focused, okay?  We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous. 
Kevin: Whether it’s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity. 
Toby: Okay. Good point... 
Angela: Good point? What is a tub of electricity? 
Toby: I don’t... I don’t... 
Oscar: With all due respect we know what we’re defending against: a twelve year old female bully. 
Kelly: I was a twelve year old bully. 
Angela: Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby. 
Others: Yeah. 
Kelly: Yeah, that’s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression. 
Angela: Thanks. 
Kelly: Good. Let’s go. 
Toby: I don’t know if this is gonna help...Uh... 
Angela: Let’s go Kelly. 
Toby: We should stay to maybe some more traditional models... 
Kelly: You think you’re so pretty!  Well you’re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time! 
Toby: Okay, this is what’s called pre-violent posturing. 
Kelly: Take that!  Not so pre-violent anymore! 
Toby: Okay, I’m at what’s called “the decision point.” 
Andy: Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye! 
Pam: [laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I’m not laughing at you. I’m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning. 
Andy: You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby.  I stepped in and I didn’t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, “Where were you when the girls came?”
 
Andy: Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off.  I just feel good!
 
Dwight: Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it.  We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation. 
Nellie: Dwight.  You’re the vice president. 
Dwight: Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah! 
Nellie: [squealing] 
Dwight: Okay! Come on! 
Nellie: aagh! 
Dwight: Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!

Andy: [exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us. 
Everyone: [gasps] What?! Why is that? 
Andy: He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever. 
Angela: So, he's alive. 
Andy: Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful. 
Angela: Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead. 
Andy: How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place. 
Phyllis: If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure? 
Oscar: You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the "treasure box" and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
 
Oscar: When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office "Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?"] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
 
Andy: I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees] 
Oscar: I am dying to know what's in there. 
Andy: Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed] 
Creed: Hi, hello.
 
Andy: [to Creed standing in front of the "treasure box"] Now, carefully... open the box. 
Creed: [opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It's a photo of all of us. 
Pam: Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
 
Dwight: [feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
 
Dwight: [on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball] 
Nellie: Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP. 
Robert California: I am loving the chemistry between you two. 
Nellie: I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George. 
Robert California: I bet. I'm excited. 
Nellie: Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo. 
Dwight: Ah! 
Nellie: I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either. 
Dwight: [to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh] 
Jim: Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift] 
Dwight: [sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah! 
Nellie: He doesn't even care. 
Dwight: Don't even care!
 
Jim: This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
 
Darryl: [entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year? 
Andy: Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice. 
Darryl: I'll put you down for shortbreads. 
Andy: Damn it. 
Toby: [entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some? 
Darryl: No. No. 
Toby: What? 
Darryl: I been selling here for five years. This is my spot. 
Toby: You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or? 
Darryl: You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting. 
Toby: That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl. 
Darryl: OK, great.
 
Darryl: [exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
 
Erin: [entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo. 
Elderly Woman: [rises from chair] Oh, here let me help. 
Erin: [spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
 
Erin: Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
 
Irene: When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all. 
Erin: Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug] 
Irene: [takes mug] Thank you. [takes a sip] Oh, what kind of tea is this? 
Erin: Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
 
Nellie: [misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias. 
Robert California: If I may, [assists Nellie] try holding the putter... yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here. 
Nellie: Oh. 
Robert California: That's right. Your little finger.
 
Darryl: [approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies? 
Kevin: Cookies, eh?
 
Kevin: [singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
 
Darryl: [Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev. 
Kevin: I know. But sometimes you still get a little something. 
Toby: [to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin. 
Darryl: You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport. 
Toby: No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me? 
Kevin: I do. 
Toby: See? 
Darryl: That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me? 
Kevin: Oh, I definitely do. 
Darryl: [to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack. 
Toby: No, you hit the road, jack. 
Kevin: [looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me. 
Toby: You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair. 
Kevin: No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed. 
Angela: Ugh. 
Kevin: Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
 
Nellie: Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked. 
Jim: [to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it. 
Dwight: Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win. 
Jim: [attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight. 
Dwight: [drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
 
Jim: Well, he's Florida's problem now. 
Robert California: I'll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day. 
Jim: What's that? 
Robert California: I'm gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board. 
Jim: I thought you liked the store? 
Robert California: Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers. 
Jim: Thank you. 
Robert California: But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? [Jim shakes head] They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us. 
Jim: Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible. 
Robert California: I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight. 
Dwight: [from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it! 
Robert California: [to Dwight] Bravo, Dwight! Very good! [Jim looks surprised] [to Jim] Shame.
 
Dwight: [at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two. 
Nellie: How did that look? 
Gabe: I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen. 
Dwight: [to Nellie] I told you. 
Todd Packer: When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off- 
Dwight: You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper. 
Jim: [enters room] All right. There he is. 
Dwight: What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you? 
Jim: Can I just talk to you for one quick second? 
Dwight: What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh] 
Jim: Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway] 
Dwight: You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh] 
Todd Packer: Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy? 
Dwight: [to Packer] Silence. 
Todd Packer: Aw, I'm just trying to- 
Dwight: [interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation. 
Todd Packer: That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made. 
Dwight: Different guy. 
Jim: You know, I just think you should know that- 
Dwight: [interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
 
Jim: Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
 
Erin: Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy. 
Irene: Just open the program and type in his user name. 
Erin: Can you just do it? 
Irene: [after briefly typing] Here, type in your password. 
Erin: 'Erin123' 
Irene: That's a terrible password. And you don't 'make a video chat', you video chat. 
Erin: [annoyed] All right. 
Andy: [video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello? 
Erin: That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it. 
Andy: Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.
 
Pam: [on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him. 
Jim: No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'. 
Pam: Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this. 
Jim: I tried. He will not listen. 
Pam: Did you actually try your hardest? 
Jim: Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up. 
Stanley: Don't talk to me. 
Jim: Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up. 
Pam: If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do. 
Jim: OK. All right.
 
Darryl: [to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago. 
Phyllis: [laughs] Yeah. 
Kevin: That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model. 
Darryl: Thank you. 
Toby: I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life. 
Darryl: Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter? 
Phyllis: Oh. [looks away]
 
Darryl: Baby, if you’re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
 
Kelly: [to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things. 
Pam: Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes. 
Phyllis: Make them kiss each other. 
Meredith: Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
 
Erin: Yes, this is too tan. This right here- 
Andy: No. 
Erin: This is a tanned spot. 
Andy: I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you. 
Erin: Well, Andy, I'm not coming back. 
Andy: What? 
Erin: I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view] 
Irene: [waves] Hello! 
Erin: Andy? 
Andy: Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.
 
Kevin: [Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me. 
Darryl: No, no, no, no. It's not worth it. 
Toby: No. 
Kevin: No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year. 
Darryl: Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes? 
Kevin: Hungrier. 
Toby: 50? 
Kevin: Hungrier. 
Darryl: You're not talking... triple digits? 
Kevin: Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
 
Dwight: [straightens tie in mirror] Showtime. 
Jim: [enters abruptly] Dwight. 
Dwight: You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick. 
Jim: OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please? 
Dwight: Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money? 
Jim: Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store. 
Dwight: [rolls eyes] Jim, come on. 
Jim: Dwight, he's gonna kill the store. 
Dwight: Uh-huh. 
Jim: And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it. 
Dwight: Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me? 
Jim: Yes. 
Dwight: [smiles] That's two things. 
Jim: Dwight, please. 
Dwight: Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today. 
Jim: OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so- 
Dwight: You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye. 
Jim: Dwight, come o- 
Dwight: Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
 
Dwight: [Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help! 
Jim: Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva? 
Dwight: AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest. 
Jim: Gross! 
Dwight: [attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah! 
Jim: What? What, what, what, what, what? 
Dwight: [clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix- 
Jim: I'm sorry. 
Dwight: My wound hasn't healed yet. 
Jim: I'm so sorry, I forgot. 
Dwight: Oh, man! 
Jim: You all right? You ok? 
Dwight: [stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!
 
Nellie: [to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him. 
Cathy: I don't know. He's not picking up. 
Todd Packer: Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man. 
Nellie: [considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer. 
Todd Packer: Sup?
 
Phyllis: [notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing? 
Andy: I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone. 
Oscar: We knew. Ryan told us. 
Andy: Ryan, why didn't you tell me? 
Ryan: Thought you checker my Tumblr? 
Andy: You never update it. 
Ryan: Well, I updated it. 
Andy: Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist? 
Pam: We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
 
Dwight: [trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs] 
Jim: What are you doing? 
Dwight: I was trying to go- 
Jim: Get up. 
Dwight: Ok, ok. 
Jim: Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by. 
Dwight: Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you. 
Jim: OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work. 
Dwight: [tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
 
Kevin: [holding mobile phone up] Go. 
Darryl: [in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex. 
Toby: [in feminine voice] And this is Sam. 
Darryl: [in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us. 
Kevin: Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day. 
Darryl: I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens. 
Toby: Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names. 
Kevin: Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony? 
Toby: Don't make me be your pony, Kevin. 
Darryl: Forget it, man. 
Kevin: What do you mean? 
Darryl: I'm out. And so is Toby.
 
Darryl: This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child. 
Toby: Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
 
Kevin: No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
 
Jim: [tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no. 
Dwight: This. Ends. Now. 
Jim: This is dangerous. 
Dwight: [picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall] 
Jim: Why? 
Dwight: Anything else you need to talk about? 
Jim: Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
 
Dwight: [looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
 
Robert California: What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, [Dwight enters] which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution. 
Todd Packer: If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute. 
Robert California: I don't see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible. 
Nellie: Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul. 
Robert California: That was never on the table. 
Todd Packer: [to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla! 
Robert California: And yet Todd, it's you who's fired. 
Todd Packer: What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]
 
Darryl: [Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them] 
Kelly: Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida? 
Jim: Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight? 
Kelly: Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds. 
Phyllis: [to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back. 
Stanley: [insincerely] Good to be back. 
Pam: [to Jim] Hey, stranger! 
Jim: Hey. 
Pam: Aw, I missed you. 
Jim: I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly] 
Pam: Aw.
 
Andy: I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!

Pam: [telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we’ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling. 
Kevin: Nice.
 
Pam: There’s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it’s not -- it doesn’t sound cool. You just have to see it.
 
Pam: Well, I guess it doesn’t look that cool either. But, it’s been up there a long time, so it’s become a pretty big deal.
 
Jim: Wow. It’s the end of an era. 
Pam: Did a good job, Buddy. Now it’s time to come home. 
Oscar: I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy. 
Kevin: When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel. 
Ryan: How long do you think it’s been up there, Kevin? 
Kevin: I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, “Look, a balloon.” 
Dwight: My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms. 
Meredith: My kid didn’t have a face tattoo. 
Darryl: I was still thinking of going back to school. 
Jim: And I was still just a paper salesman. 
Dwight: Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
 
All: Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. [pops loudly] [cheers and applause]
 
Jim: Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it? 
Kevin: oooh 
Darryl: Me. 
Phyllis: Yeah. 
Dwight: Right here. 
Nellie: Allow me to solve your problem, then. 
Jim: Nellie 
Nellie: Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie? 
Jim: What brings you to town? 
Nellie: Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here. 
Dwight: What?
 
Dwight: How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
 
Toby: Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony. 
Nellie: Mm. 
Pam: What? 
Toby: I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby. 
Pam: You messed up saying your name? 
Toby: It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in. 
Nellie: That one looks empty. 
Jim: No, that's Andy's office. 
Nellie: Oh, is it?
 
Nellie: I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
 
Erin: Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo. 
Alonzo: Good morning Erin. [driving by delivering newspapers] 
Erin: How are you? How's your family doing? 
Erin: Bye.
 
Erin: Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
 
Robert: Nellie. 
Nellie: Robert. 
Robert: How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far? 
Nellie: So far, so good. 
Robert: Good. 
Nellie: Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous. 
Robert: Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it? 
Nellie: Mm-hm. 
Robert: Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we? 
Nellie: Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove. 
Robert: We have a manager. 
Nellie: Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
 
Robert: Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning? 
Kevin: Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys? 
Andy: [on phone] Hello. 
Robert: Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work? 
Andy: Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick. 
Robert: I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately. 
Andy: Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...
 
Andy: [standing in ocean] ...Florida Flu.
 
Robert: He just hung up on me mid-sentence.
 
Andy: I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
 
Robert: Not much we can do about this until he gets here. 
Jim: Can't you do something about this? 
Robert: Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim. 
Jim: -Right.
 
Jim: What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
 
Irene: Erin, you got a package. 
Erin: I'm in the bathroom. 
Glenn: Where's the postage? I mean, there's no shipping label. 
Irene: Did you wash your hands? 
Erin: Yes. 
Erin and Irene: [screaming as Andy busts out of box] 
Andy: [singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours! 
Erin: Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
 
Andy: Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you. 
Irene: Where's the ring? 
Andy: Hm? 
Irene: Where's the ring, Lancelot? 
Erin: Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn. 
Erin: Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you. 
Glenn: [whispering off screen] Why won't she go with him? 
Irene: [whispering] I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome. 
Erin: Hey... don't listen.
 
Nellie: So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
 
Jim: I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
 
Nellie: So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager. 
Pam: Robert, is Nellie our new manager? 
Robert: [laughs] This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out.
 
Robert: We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
 
Nellie: I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way. 
Kevin: Hot tub party? 
Nellie: Performance reviews. 
Pam: How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us? 
Nellie: On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
 
Glenn: Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today. 
Erin: Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better. 
Irene: So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend? 
Andy: Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know. 
Erin: So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend. 
Irene: I think you should leave, young man. 
Andy: All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you. 
Erin: You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
 
Jim: Any luck? 
Pam: No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail. 
Andy: [on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
 
Erin: Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating] 
Irene: You should take it. It's probably your girlfriend wondering where you are. 
Andy: Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger. 
Irene: You really wouldn't feel those kinds of results after one session. 
Andy: I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine. 
Irene: You could put it on silent. 
Andy: I don't think it does that. 
Irene: Just go to preferences, then click – 
Glenn: [answering Andy's phone] Proctology. 
Jim: [on phone] Andy? 
Andy: Jim? 
Jim: Andy, where are you? 
Andy: I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man. 
Irene: He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down. 
Jim: What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job. 
Andy: What do you mean, take my job? 
Jim: Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager. 
Andy: Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.
 
Jim: Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager. 
Angela: Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work? 
Pam: I like working here. 
Jim: Dwight, should she be our manager? 
Dwight: I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
 
Dwight: Those who can't farm, farm celery.
 
Jim: And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat] 
Nellie: All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis. 
Phyllis: Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know. 
Nellie: Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight. 
Dwight: I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever. 
Nellie: Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise. 
Dwight: What? 
Nellie: Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise? 
Dwight: There's no limit to what I think I deserve. 
Nellie: Then you accept it? 
Dwight: Five percent. No less. 
Nellie: Absolutely not. Seven percent. 
Dwight: Six percent, I know my worth. 
Jim: The raise isn't real. 
Dwight: Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard. 
Nellie: So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it. 
Pam: Phyllis. 
Phyllis: Pam.
 
Nellie: So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you. 
Phyllis: Really? 
Nellie: Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
 
Jim: Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises? 
Robert: I am not. Huh. 
Jim: Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis. 
Robert: Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown? 
Jim: Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry. 
Robert: Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss. 
Jim: Yes. 
Robert: Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor? 
Jim: Oh, god, nature, please. 
Robert: When two animals are having sex, one of them... 
Jim: [exhales sharply] 
Robert: … is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor. 
Jim: Was that not the-- 
Robert: All life is sex. And all sex is competition. 
Jim: Mm-hm. 
Robert: And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it? 
Jim: Was that it? No, that wasn't bad. 
Robert: My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?
Jim: No. I would've said no.
 
Nellie: Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise. 
Kelly: Oh, great.
 
Jim: I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that. 
Dwight: No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now. 
Darryl: No. 
Dwight: Yes. 
Darryl: No. 
Dwight: Yes. 
Darryl: No. 
Dwight: Yes. 
Darryl: No. 
Dwight: Yes. 
Darryl: No. 
Dwight: Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off. 
Dwight: [Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow. 
Dwight: [panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome. 
Creed: Touch me and I'll sue.
 
Erin: I've heard that's amazing when it works. 
Andy: Yeah, if I had my own-- 
Erin: Andy, I care about you and I think-- 
Andy: --sorry, you go. 
Erin: No, go ahead. 
Andy: Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say? 
Erin: Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else? 
Andy: You broke my heart too. 
Erin: You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be. 
Andy: I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time. 
Erin: I know. 
Andy: [sighs]
 
Nellie: So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want. 
Pam: Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy. 
Nellie: That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two. 
Pam: Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim? 
Nellie: Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night? 
Pam: Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle. 
Nellie: You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap? 
Pam: No. 
Nellie: Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money. 
Pam: I think... you're a witch. 
Nellie: I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: “I'm amazing.” 
Pam: [drowsily] I'm amazing. [sighs]
 
Irene: Erin, I think you're making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy. 
Erin: Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon. 
Irene: I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he's willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink-- 
Erin: Irene, what would you do without me? 
Irene: We're not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn's going to sue Home Depot. 
Erin: Why? 
Irene: He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
 
Nellie: Jim, time for your review. 
Jim: No, it's not, because you don't really work here. 
Nellie: Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise? 
Jim: Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises. 
Nellie: Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell? 
Jim: Yes. 
Nellie: I'm Tinkerbell. 
Jim: No. 
Nellie: Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises. 
Stanley: And we are grateful. 
Nellie: But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist. 
Jim: She dies. 
Nellie: She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell? 
Jim: Let's see it. Show of hands. 
Kevin: I do. [applause] Come on everyone... 
Jim: All right, guys, stop. 
Meredith: I already spent the money. 
Jim: How? 
Kevin: Come on Jim, you're killing her! 
All: We believe! We believe! 
Robert: Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe. [applause continues]
 
Andy: That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it. 
Erin: Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I’m sorry. 
Andy: Erin! 
Erin: Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street] 
Erin: Let's get out of here. 
Andy: Okay. 
Erin: Let's go. 
Andy: Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff. 
Erin: No, I don't have any stuff. 
Andy: Like your toothbrush and stuff. 
Erin: I don't have one. 
Andy: You don't have a toothbrush? 
Erin: No. 
Andy: How do you not have a toothbrush? 
Erin: I just... there's always one around. 
Andy: You just use whichever one is sitting there? 
Erin: I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush? 
Andy: Of course. I own my toothbrush.
 
Nellie: I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.

Pam: Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card? 
Jim: Oh, great. [reads] "Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy." Oh that's not good. 
Phyllis: Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious. 
Pam: It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache. 
Jim: Stanley doesn't have a moustache. 
Pam: Yeah he does. 
Oscar: Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache. 
Pam: Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not? 
Phyllis: Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't. 
Pam: Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this! 
Jim: Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face? 
Angela: 'Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business. 
Pam: Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache] 
Dwight: Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left. 
Gabe: [bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him? 
Jim: Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands] 
Dwight: Yep. 
Jim: Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face] 
Gabe: [reveals Stanley's moustache] Ah! Ha ha ha! 
Phyllis: He does have a moustache. 
Dwight: Yes! 
Pam: Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts]
 
Robert: "Good morning, Robert," says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. [no one responds] Pam! 
Pam: Oh! [takes out earbuds] 
Robert: Is this a video conference you're having with "Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz"? 
Pam: Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day. 
Robert: People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being- 
Nellie: Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness. 
Robert: [laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty? 
Nellie: Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze. 
Robert: Ah. 
Nellie: Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse! 
Robert: [laughs] I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman. 
Nellie: Ah ha! 
Robert: I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason. 
Nellie: Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it. 
Robert: No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life. 
Nellie: Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here? 
Kevin & Meredith: [in unison] Yes. 
Nellie: Ugh! I hate that! No offense. 
Kevin: None taken. 
Oscar: Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive. 
Nellie: oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless! 
Stanley: Who's a native? 
Nellie: Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans] 
Oscar: What does that mean? 
Dwight: Okay, okay. 
Nellie: If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
Robert: Nellie? 
Nellie: Yes, Robert! 
Robert: You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in. 
Nellie: Yeah. 
Robert: Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place. 
Dwight: Why Jim? 
Robert: The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
 
Pam: I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
 
Jim: I’m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
 
Pam: I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
 
Jim: Why is she here?
 
Andy: [sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life. 
Erin: [sings] Going to Pennsylvania.
 
Andy: On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
Erin: Oh. That must be nice. 
Andy: Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy. 
Erin: Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents. 
Andy: Oh. Hmm.
 
Andy: [sings] Time to have a little kiss! 
Erin: No. 
Andy: Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official. 
Erin: Yes. 
Andy: I believe in that. 
Erin: Yes. So do I. 
Andy: I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important. 
Erin: Important. 
Andy: Mm-hmm.
 
Phyllis: I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her. 
Pam: I know, right? 
Oscar: She's always late, she's always rude... 
Phyllis: It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party. 
Oscar: Yeah. 
Phyllis: On purpose. 
Pam: Phyllis! 
Angela: [laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle] 
Phyllis: Order carrot cake. [laughter]
 
Andy: ...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you. 
Erin: Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds. 
Andy: Consider it nailed. 
Erin: [vocalizing] I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario. 
Andy: Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know- 
Erin: [whining] What? 
Andy: I just need you to know- 
Erin: What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
 
Dwight: [lifting box] Ugh! Ow. 
Jim: Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door. 
Dwight: Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is." 
Jim: That was one time- 
Dwight: I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic. 
Nellie: Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic. 
Jim: [cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi. 
Pam: Hey, what's up? 
Jim: Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight. 
Dwight: [shouting] Haulin' cube! 
Jim: That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler. 
Pam: So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad. 
Jim: Sounds like every other party. 
Pam: No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card. 
Jim: Oh! Hire a magician. 
Pam: What? 
Jim: Trust me. 
Pam: [laughs] Okay.
 
Andy: Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird. 
Lauren: [knocks on car window] Andy! Hey, what are you doing here? 
Andy: Hey, Lauren. Look at you. 
Lauren: Well, I know. Look at me. 
Andy: I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica. 
Lauren: Aww! [clicks tongue] 
Andy: Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car. 
Lauren: Oh. God. 
Erin: So, I'm Erin. Hi. 
Andy: Yep. This is Erin. 
Lauren: Nice to meet you. [Erin gasps at another girl outside her window] Well, Jess went out for a run but she'll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy's here! 
Erin: Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go? 
Andy: Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just- 
Lauren: Oh, Jess! [claps] Look who stopped by after his business trip! 
Jessica: Andy! Hey!
 
Dwight: I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account. 
Jim: Yes, you should. 
Dwight: [finds shoe box] Ooh. 
Jim: [reads] "Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie." 
Dwight: I have to see these shoes. 
Jim: I doubt that they're sh- 
Dwight: Oh! 
Jim: Whoa. Who is this guy? 
Dwight: Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend. 
Jim: Boyfriend. 
Dwight: Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend. 
Jim: Like a boyfriend? 
Dwight: You read my mind. 
Jim: Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out. 
Dwight: Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician. 
Jim: Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup. 
Nellie: [walks in] Oh. 
Jim: Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just... 
Nellie: I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry. 
Dwight: Why not call... 
Jim: Shh!
 
Nellie: God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant. 
Dwight: That's awful. What kind of restaurant. 
Jim: Dwight! 
Nellie: I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one? 
Jim: I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories. 
Dwight: If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick. 
Nellie: Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this. 
Jim: No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or... 
Nellie: God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
 
Jim: [in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff. 
Pam: What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you. 
Jim: No, that's not what I- 
Nellie: Jim, could you give us a hand? 
Jim: Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me. 
Pam: Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone] 
Angela: Pam, we have a great idea. 
Oscar: Listen to this. 
Angela: We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick. 
Pam: Or what if... 
Angela: Okay. 
Pam: We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean. 
Angela: I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know. 
Oscar: We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point. 
Pam: What are you talking about? Yes we can. 
Oscar: What I mean to say is we don't want to. 
Phyllis: Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
 
Lauren: [pops balloon] Suck it! [cheers, applause] 
Erin: Andy- 
Andy: It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis? 
Erin: No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears. 
Andy: These are delicious. 
Erin: But... they're penises. 
Lauren: And we come to Matthew. The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together. [party guests groan] 
Andy: Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one. 
Party guests: No, pop it. Pop it! [Lauren pops the balloon, party guests cheer] 
Jessica: Hey. 
Andy: Hey. 
Jessica: Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse. 
Megan: [grabs Andy] Ahh! 
Andy: Oh! Ah, Megan. 
Megan: You are one of the good ones, nard dog. 
Andy: Aww. 
Megan: No, really. [to Jessica] Where's my Andy? 
Jessica: I dunno. 
Andy: Oh, he's out there. 
Megan: Aww. Are you going to sing for us? 
Andy: Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so... 
Megan: That's not like you. That's not like you. Come on, sing! Sing! 
Andy: [singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
 
Pam: Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie] 
Darryl: Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag. 
Ryan: Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult. 
Oscar: Plus everyone would know who you meant. 
Ryan: Yeah! 
Pam: No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst? 
Angela: Nobody's named Monday. 
Ryan: Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember. 
Pam: 'Cause there's someone already here named Pam. 
Kevin: Shh, here she comes! 
All: Hey! 
Phyllis: Welcome to your party. 
Creed: Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
 
Creed: Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, "Have you heard my originals? They're terrible." They said, "Even better." I said, "I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie."
 
Erin: Maybe we should just go. 
Andy: No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you? 
Jessica: Uh, yeah, sure. What's up? 
Andy: Uh, maybe we could talk in private? 
Jessica: Uh, yeah. What is it? 
Andy: Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends. 
Jessica: You're breaking up with me? 
Andy: Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now. 
Jessica: Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it? 
Andy: Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
Jessica: What? 
Andy: I am gay, and I prefer men. 
Kenny: I knew it! 
Andy: You did not, Kenny! 
Kenny: You invited me to go shopping with you. 
Andy: I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay. 
Jessica: Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable. 
Andy: Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos. 
Jessica: I can't say it doesn't make sense... 
Andy: Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but- 
Jessica: Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now. 
Andy: Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.
 
Robert: This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent. 
Oscar: To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company. 
Robert: Cheers. 
Nellie: Why thank you. 
Oscar: Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company. 
All: Cheers. 
Angela: Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter] 
Jim: Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with. 
Creed: We hate Pam. We hate Pam. 
All: We hate Pam! We hate Pam! 
Magician: So we've established- 
Jim: No. No. 
Magician: -that you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just... disappear? [sets off flash paper] 
Pam: Oh! [laughter, murmuring]
 
Erin: That was a really rough scene. 
Andy: Right? Rough scene. 
Erin: Yeah. 
Andy: Oh... at least we can kiss now. 
Erin: Oh, yeah. [gives him a quick kiss] 
Andy: You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time. 
Erin: Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired. 
Andy: Yeah. 
Erin: Probably from seeing that turkey. 
Andy: Oh yeah. 
Erin: When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
 
Magician: Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh? 
Jim: Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer. 
Robert: no, Nellie, she- 
Jim: I'll do it. 
Magician: Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for... birds. [chuckles] All right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is... I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is. 
Jim: [picks a card] It's the four of hearts. 
Robert: Oh, no, you- 
Magician: Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? [Jim drops the cards] You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya? 
Robert: [to Dwight] Why is Jim treating the magician poorly? 
Magician: Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory. 
Jim: Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place. 
Magician: But I never could seem to figure out those knots. 
Pam: That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears. 
Magician: [yells] What the hell? All right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here- 
Dwight: Okay scram, wizard. 
Magician: What? 
Dwight: You heard me! 
Magician: Huh! 
Robert: Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician- 
Nellie: Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see? 
Robert: Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party. 
Kevin: You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
 
Erin: What? Why are we- 
Andy: I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door] 
Megan: Oh. Hello. Hey everybody, look who's here. 
Jessica: What are you doing here? 
Andy: Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material. 
Megan: Why the hell did you come back here? 
Jessica: Go away. 
Kenny: Get lost! 
Woman: Get out! 
Andy: Okay. 
Lauren: You're done! 
Andy: Bye guys. 
Lauren: Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? [Andy and Erin run to the car] Yeah, run away! 
Kenny: You're disgusting! 
Lauren: I can't believe you're not gay! [Andy and Erin kiss] 
Kenny: Yeah get out of here. 
Various: Don't come back. [someone throws food at the car] 
Erin: Uh-oh! [laughs, they drive away] 
Various: You don't even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!
 
Pam: Hey Hank. 
Hank: Yes ma'am. 
Pam: I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician. 
Hank: Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open. 
Jim: Well, turns out he actually made it up there. 
Hank: What? That ain't right. 
Pam: Yeah, he came and went. 
Hank: Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? [Pam nods] You don't think he could've used... it couldn't have been... 
Pam: Let's just- let's go. 
Jim: Night-night.
Phyllis: Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
 
Jim: Phyllis says the same twelve clichés every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
 
Darryl: So how was the drive in? 
Phyllis: Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain. 
Darryl: You don't say? 
Phyllis: Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
 
Phyllis: Oh, the plants are gonna love this. 
Oscar: Yeah.
 
Phyllis: I actually sleep better when it's raining. 
Meredith: Tell me about it.
 
Oscar: Time's almost up. How many are left? 
Pam: Just one. "This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book." 
Darryl: Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something? 
Phyllis: What do you mean? 
Pam: You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain? 
Jim: Hey, come on. 
Phyllis: Lots of things are cozy in the rain. 
Jim: And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan]
 
Phyllis: I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today. I'm really happy being here.
 
Andy: [singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble- 
Andy & Erin: Hey la, hey la... 
Andy: ...my girlfriend's back! 
Erin: [simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud] 
Andy: Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi. 
Kevin: Welcome home. 
Erin: Thank you. 
Andy: Hey, Kev. 
Kevin: Yeah. 
Andy: Nice sweater. 
Kevin: [wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets. 
Andy: What happened to old salty? 
Dwight: Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
 
Dwight: I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
 
Andy: Okey dokey. [knocks on door] 
Nellie: Yes? 
Andy: Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about. 
Nellie: Oh yes. 
Andy: I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence. 
Nellie: You are most welcome. 
Andy: Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance. 
Nellie: No. 
Andy: Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better. 
Nellie: Mm-hmm. 
Andy: Get back to normalcy. 
Nellie: Hmm, no.
 
Ravi: ...and then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. And then after Jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. [Pam, Jim and Kelly laugh] But if he keeps having problems, just give me a call. 
Pam: Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have. 
Jim: That's it. 
Kelly: It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
 
Pam: Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl. 
Jim: Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it. 
Pam: Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
 
Pam: [talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past. 
Kelly: [cries, slams fist on desk] Why? 
Pam: [Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean. 
Kevin: [Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
 
Ryan: Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby. 
Jim: Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby. 
Ryan: Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that. 
Pam: Don't shake our baby? 
Ryan: Yeah. 
Pam: Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you. 
Ryan: Oh, my God. 
Pam: Yeah, I'm glad you said something. 
Ryan: Me too.
 
Ryan: Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
 
Ryan: Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh? 
Pam: Yeah, they're really great together. 
Ryan: Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love? 
Jim: That's about it, yeah.
 
Robert: Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office- 
Nellie: No. 
Robert: I'm sorry? 
Andy: This is what I was trying to tell you. 
Robert: I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs] 
Nellie: Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes. 
Robert: You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves.
 
Robert: I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.
 
Nellie: I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars. 
Andy: [chuckling] Okay. 
Nellie: Five... four... 
Andy: You can't dock my pay- 
Nellie: Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars. 
Angela: On it! 
Andy: Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela? 
Nellie: Do you want to go again? 
Andy: Angela? 
Nellie: Let's go again. Five... four... 
Andy: Ooh, she's counting again. 
Nellie: Three... two... one... 
Andy: Oh, oh! 
Nellie: Angela, two hundred dollars! 
Angela: You got it. 
Andy: Seriously, Angela?
 
Andy: I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago. 
Erin: When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
 
Nellie: I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four... 
Andy: You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless. 
Nellie: Three... 
Andy: It's literally like- 
Nellie: Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
 
Erin: There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
 
Erin: Hey. So last night was so not a big deal. 
Andy: Oh, yeah, I was just tired. 
Erin: We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self. 
Andy: Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night. 
Erin: Really. It's not a big deal. 
Andy: Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
 
Ryan: I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you. 
Kelly: Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share. 
Ryan: Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight. 
Kelly: God I don't even remember what that fight was about. 
Ryan: You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
 
Ryan: I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
 
Erin: When you lost the manager job- 
Dwight: Yes? 
Erin: Did it affect you outside of the office? 
Dwight: How? 
Erin: I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis? 
Dwight: Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never. 
Erin: Oh, okay. 
Dwight: Okay? 
Erin: Okay. 
Dwight: Washington Monument. 
Erin: Oh. 
Dwight: Eiffel Tower. 
Erin: Okay, okay.
 
Pam: I saw you were getting along with Ryan again. 
Kelly: He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, "Kelly, that will be the color of our children." 
Pam: Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though? 
Kelly: Which time?
 
Pam: I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
 
Dwight: One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
 
Dwight: Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
 
Dwight: Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that. 
Nellie: What do you mean? 
Dwight: Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
 
Nellie: I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
 
Nellie: Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room. 
Andy: You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting. 
Nellie: Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started. 
Andy: Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So. 
Nellie: No. 
Andy: Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important. 
Robert: Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is "impotence." 
Nellie: Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
 
Nellie: "Take a man's job, but leave him his balls." Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
 
Nellie: This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem. 
Dwight: It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male. 
Oscar: Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular? 
Nellie: Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men. 
Robert & Creed: [in unison] How old? 
Creed: Jinx. Buy me some Coke. 
Nellie: Dwight told me about it earlier. 
Erin: Dwight! 
All: What? 
Erin: You promised! 
Kevin: Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie? 
Dwight: No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis] 
Angela: What are you doing? 
Oscar: What is this? 
Angela: Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it. 
Andy: Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
 
Andy: I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
 
Andy: Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
Jim: Um... 
Darryl: Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what. 
Robert: It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating. 
Andy: Fascinating. 
Gabe: I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton. 
Nellie: Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo? 
Kevin: Tip-top shape. 
Nellie: Oh... Stanley? 
Stanley: No. Um-um. 
Nellie: Creed, you are a thousand years old. 
Creed: Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did. 
Andy: Okay, so I- 
Pam: Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it. 
Jim: What happened? 
Pam: That a couple of times- 
Jim: Couple of times. 
Robert: Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times. 
Dwight: Yeah Jim. 
Andy: Yeah Jim, get it out there. 
Jim: Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted... 
Pam: Okay, stop. 
Jim: I was very drunk. 
Phyllis: If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
 
Phyllis: Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
 
Gabe: I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help. 
Angela: Ugh. 
Gabe: This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on. 
Robert: No, that's absolutely the case. 
Gabe: I know, right? 
Dwight: You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it. 
Robert: Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share? [Creed, Kevin and Meredith raise their hands] 
Kevin: Ooh, ooh! 
Jim: Wow, what are we talking about? 
Erin: Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff? 
Toby: Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything. 
Nellie: The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
 
Robert: I almost didn't come in today. [laughs]
 
Andy: [on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet. 
Nellie: Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional. 
Erin: Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself! 
Andy: Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses! 
Erin: And Andy is the manager, not Nellie! 
Andy: Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you! 
Nellie: Okay, just calm down. 
Andy: You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit. 
Robert: Andy, why don't you just take a seat? 
Andy: Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair] 
Erin: And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels? 
Andy: And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah! 
Darryl: He does not like that wall.
 
Erin: Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together. 
Andy: That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys. 
Robert: Andy, Erin, you can join us now.
 
Ryan: Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly. 
Pam: All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly. 
Ryan: Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face. 
Pam: Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much. 
Ryan: Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is. 
Oscar: Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better. 
Ryan: For Kelly? 
Kevin: Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package. 
Nate: I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy. 
Ryan: Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it. 
Pam: Oh, no, no, no. 
Oscar: Oh, come on. 
Pam: Read it, please. I love amazing poetry. 
Ryan: No. It would cause me too much pain. 
Pam: Read through the pain. Be strong. 
Ryan: This poem would crush you! 
Oscar: Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend! 
Kevin: Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone. 
Ryan: You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
 
Kelly: Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
 
Robert: Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny. [chuckles] 
Andy: No. 
Robert: Excuse me? 
Andy: I'm saying no. 
Robert: Well you can't say no. 
Andy: No.
 
Pam: [sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo! 
Ryan: You are toxic! You are toxic! 
Pam: Boo! 
Jim: Hey, hey. Okay. 
Ryan: Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt. 
Kelly: I wasn't going to interrupt. 
Ryan: Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably. 
Pam: Barf! Ugh, you suck! 
Ryan: What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me. 
Wrangler: Turn around. Turn around. Turn around! 
Ryan: Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you. 
Wrangler: She don't wanna turn around. 
Ryan: Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly. 
Kelly: Ryan. 
Ryan: Will you roll those dice with me? 
Kelly: You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him. 
Ryan: No you don't. 
Kelly: I do. 
Ryan: No you don't. 
Kelly: I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug? 
Ryan: What? [they hug] 
Kelly: That was really cool. [they make out] 
Angela: Ugh. Eww! 
Jim: Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing. 
Angela: Oh God!
 
Robert: Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job. 
Andy: No. 
Nellie: It's the apology. I really have to insist. 
Andy: [British accent] No. 
Nellie: Stop saying no. 
Andy: No. 
Robert: Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say? 
Andy: No.
 
Andy: I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive. 
Erin: Here- [grabs the box Andy's holding] 
Andy: Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it. 
Erin: But you hurt your hand. 
Andy: I... Got... It. 
Erin: Right now? 
Andy: Yes.
 
Pam: You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul? 
Jim: Not at all, can we go? 
Pam: "Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches." 
Jim: Second line. 
Pam: "He is a drifter out to sea."
 
Jim: "And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green." 
Pam: It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
 
Jim: Uh, Ryan can never know.

Ryan: [pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no. 
Pam: Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter? 
Ryan: Smokey's dead. 
Pam: Smokey, the bear? 
Ryan: Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know. 
Jim: Wow That's terrible, I really liked him. 
Ryan: Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now. 
Jim: Well, I second that emotion. 
Ryan: Huh? 
Nellie: I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones? 
Ryan: Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, "Tracks of my Tears"? 
Nellie: Yeah 
Ryan: Um... God, so many, Nellie! 
Pam: No, no, no, "Tracks of My Tears" and what else? What are some more? What's one more? 
Ryan: Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today. 
Pam: I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music 
Ryan: Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles. 
Dwight: You don't like the Beatles? 
Ryan: That's... That's not the point! 
Dwight: Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer? 
Ryan: Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing? 
Oscar: It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago. 
Ryan: Okay well, that's a relief! 
Jim: Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away! 
Pam: Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go! 
Jim: Tickets are 250 bucks. 
Pam: 250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan. 
Ryan: Yeah... Who's opening? 
Jim: Paul Anka. 
Ryan: Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this. 
Jim: Okay, you could just show up late though. 
Ryan: How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want. 
Pam: Tears of a clown! 
Ryan: Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
 
Darryl: Looking good, RC! 
Robert: Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's? 
Angela: Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
 
Angela: My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
 
Dwight: I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed 
Jim: Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people... 
Oscar: What's going on? 
Dwight: There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot. 
Erin: Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out 
Dwight: That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male "hanging out". Call the cops! 
Pam: Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody. 
Phyllis: How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there? 
Dwight: I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case. 
Nellie: I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
 
Andy: Hey! 
Erin: Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see. 
Angela: We think you might kill Robert. 
Andy: What? 
Kevin: because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now. 
Andy: guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser. 
Pam: Oh, great! That sounds good! 
Kevin: Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird. 
Andy: Why would that be weird? 
Kevin: It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week. 
Erin: Andy's just coming as my date. 
Kevin: Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
 
Nellie: [hears knocks on door.] Come in! 
Darryl: You really re-did Andy's office, huh? 
Nellie: Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal. 
Darryl: I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out. 
Nellie: How are things in the warehouse? 
Darryl: You could go downstairs and ask them? 
Nellie: The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it? 
Darryl: Who knew, right? 
Nellie: [speechless.] I...
 
Nellie: Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
 
Angela: Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello. 
Andy: Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy? 
Kevin: Oh man, this is weird! 
Robert: Andrew. [Robert extends his hand.] 
Andy: Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
 
Andy: [points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
 
Kevin: Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy! 
Creed: Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two! 
Kevin: No! It was my idea to not be raped! 
Dwight: [Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180! 
Kevin: Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand. 
Dwight: You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
 
Kevin: So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
 
Andy: What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it. 
Jim: Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us. 
Andy: The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil. 
Pam: Sounds like you're doing alright. 
Andy: Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
 
Ryan: Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
 
Senator: You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals. 
Oscar: my dog Gerald is my life. 
Senator: really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... Excuse me. [Walks away.]
 
Oscar: This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
 
Robert: [telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start-- 
Andy: Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas? 
Robert: Well... 
Andy: You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control. 
Robert: So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure? 
Andy: Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants. 
Robert: and the hero, who's that based on? 
Andy: Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I! 
Meredith: Hey jabroni. Show some class. 
Stanley: She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni 
Andy: You're being a Thomas Oregon! 
Robert: Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight? 
Andy: Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow? 
Robert: Andy you should leave. Now. 
Andy: [to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please. 
Waiter: I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units. 
Andy: then I'll take a table! 
Waiter: Okay 
Andy: And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!
 
Andy: [waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!
 
Oscar: I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me! 
Pam: Oh my god! 
Oscar: I know! 
Jim: Wait, what? Come on! 
Oscar: We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it. 
Jim: Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter? 
Oscar: Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote. 
Jim: Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.] 
Pam: Whoa! 
Jim: What happened, did he do it? 
Pam: Are you-- Twice! For real? 
Jim: Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey. 
Pam: Life is Downton Abbey. 
Jim: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
 
Dwight: [on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
 
Dwight: It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
 
Andy: Hey... David Wallace! 
David: Andy Bernard! 
Andy: Hey, how are you? 
David: How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin? 
Andy: No, got canned last week. 
David: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
Andy: No, best thing that ever happened to me. 
David: That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It. 
Andy: Yikes! 
David: Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
 
Nellie: Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like? 
Darryl: Tacos. 
Nellie: What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now! 
Darryl: I can go get us some tacos. 
Nellie: Brilliant! 
Darryl: If you loan me some money. 
Nellie: Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20? 
Darryl: $30. 
Nellie: $30, yes!
 
Nellie: I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
 
Oscar: [Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So? 
Jim: Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.] 
Oscar: This is interesting. 
Pam: Hm-hmm. 
Jim: what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody. 
Pam: Or you proved that he thinks you're gay. 
Oscar: He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes. 
Pam: Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes! 
Jim: Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
 
Speaker: Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. Robert California! 
Robert: Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason! 
Andy: can you believe this guy? 
Robert: The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.] 
Andy: Not a joke. That was not even a joke. 
Robert: Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will 
Andy: I will! I will take all of those dogs! 
Robert: Andy, that's very kind-- 
Andy: No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated. 
Robert: Andy why don't we discuss this at a-- 
Andy: No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends! 
Erin: Oh God! 
Senator: Mr. Bernard, right this way. 
Andy: Okay! Hope you all learned something!
 
Vet: Huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. So, other end is best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo because daisy will start to, uh... I was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream. 
Andy: I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already. 
Vet: Uh, no. Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis. 
Andy: Stupid dog.
 
Senator: Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! So here's my office number, and my cell number. 
Meredith: Thank you!
 
Pam: Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar. 
Oscar: sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
 
Oscar: No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
 
Darryl: Tacos were on sale, eight for $3! 
Nellie: Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos! 
Darryl: Hmhmm. 
Nellie: Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
 
Darryl: She's trying.
 
Speaker: The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute! 
Dwight: [applause] Yes! Thank you! 
Speaker: The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute! 
Dwight: [applause] Oh yes! Yeah! 
Speaker: A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute! 
Dwight: [applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha! 
Speaker: Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here! 
Dwight: Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it! 
Speaker: Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause] 
Jim: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! 
Dwight: Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
 
Senator: Oscar! 
Oscar: Nice to see you again, it was lovely! 
Senator: It was lovely! And don't forget to call. 
Oscar: okay 
Senator: thanks so much for coming
 
Oscar: why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
 
Andy: [applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this? 
Vet: that's right! 
Andy: Ugh, oh god! 
Vet: Yeah, you never get used to that. 
Jim: Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing. 
Andy: I am so great! 
Erin: He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse. 
Jim: Look at that one though, he's smiling! 
Vet: Yeah, he should be! It's his first day without a muzzle. 
Andy: This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me 
Pam: Absolutely, it's awesome-- 
Jim: Yes-- 
Kevin: I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best. 
Andy: You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe-- 
Vet: Maybe you would think it too! [silence.] I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations. 
Jim: Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh. 
Pam: Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step! 
Andy: Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on! 
Jim: Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right? 
Andy: Yeah, I do. I have that. 
Jim: Yeah 
Erin: You're going to be alright 
Kevin: No. No he's not. 
Andy: Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev! 
Kevin: You're welcome!
 
Kevin: Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
 
Erin: So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great! 
Darryl: Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs. 
Kevin: My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill. 
Pam: What do you feed her? 
Kevin: Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty! 
Darryl: Is she sick? How are her poops? 
Kevin: Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it. 
Pam: Does she smell? 
Kevin: She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
 
Kevin: People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!

Gabe: Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat. 
Dwight: Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don’t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
 
Gabe: I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They’d flex them all night at the discotheque. 
Dwight: Oh, I bet you think it’s all about core, huh? 
Gabe: Yeah. 
Dwight: Oh, please. 
Gabe: Core’s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One – lengthen. Two – elongate. 
Jim: Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who’s the strongest? Well, there’s only one way to solve that – flat curl contest.
 
Jim: All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go. 
Dwight: Feast on this, Lewis. 
Gabe: I love the burn. The burn is where I live. 
Jim: Come on, Gabe, you can’t handle his hamstrings. You’re getting hypno-thigh-zed. 
Gabe: Speed set. One. Two. 
Jim: Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows. 
Dwight: Oh, thank you. 
Jim: You’re welcome. 
Gabe: Five. Six. 
Jim: Quick phone call from you guys, keep going, 
All: Eight, nine, ten. 
Gabe: We got it?
 
Dwight: Very funny Jim. 
Gabe: Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies. 
Robert: Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over] 
Jim: All right, easy there, grandpa. 
Dwight: I don’t need your help. 
Jim: Okay. You don’t need my help? 
Dwight: Here, here… Just…
 
Andy: Morning. 
Erin: Hey. 
Andy: Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot… these. 
Erin: Oh. 
Andy: You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone. 
Erin: Andy, if you’re gonna hang out for a while, uh… 
Andy: What’s this? 
Erin: This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in. 
Andy: Is this Robert’s attempt to embarrass me? 
Erin: No, of course not. It’s just – I think it’s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it’s like, where does it end? So just… [puts visitors tag on Andy]
 
Andy: Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they’re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it’s a little much? …Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that’s what it feels like.
 
Jim: All right, well, enjoy the alumni game. 
Dwight: Good, we have a deal? 
Jim: Thanks Janet. 
Dwight: Thanks so much Earl. 
Jim: Wow, simultaneous sale. 
Dwight: And they said it couldn’t be done. Boom! 
Jim: Screw ‘em. 
Andy: Lot going on guys. What’s happening? 
Jim: Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs. 
Andy: That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It’s like a festival of poo. 
Jim: Hey, hey, come on, language. 
Dwight: Yeah, and we’re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes. 
Jim: In the fridge. 
Dwight: No, Jim, the butt, in his butt. 
Jim: Sorry, man, I can’t focus on zingers. There’s too many potential clients. 
Stanley: You two better watch yourselves. 
Phyllis: Yeah, the Syracuse branch can’t be happy you’re taking New York clients. 
Robert: Shh… shh… [vomits in trash can] 
Jim: Robert? 
Oscar: Why did Binghamton close? 
Robert: Can everyone just, please… I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and – how should I say this – Columbian whites. What – what is this about, uh, Binghamton? 
Kevin: The branch closed. Forever.
 
Robert: Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I’m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
 
Nellie: I got your voicemail. From – from last night. 
Robert: Wonderful. 
Nellie: And the answer… is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves] 
Robert: Pam, when’s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn’t hold the memories in? 
Pam: Oh, it was this summer – 
Robert: Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said. 
Pam: Um, I am a little busy. 
Robert: Yes, ‘course. Why don’t you list the things that would keep you from helping me. 
Pam: Yeah, I can make you a list. 
Robert: Let’s do it now. What’s number one? 
Pam: Why don’t I help you now? 
Robert: There we go. 
Pam: Okay.
 
[Andy cooking food by reception, Harry walks in] 
Harry: Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute? 
Erin: Jim, Dwight, what are your last names? 
Dwight: And you are… 
Harry: Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse. 
[shocked look from Jim] 
Harry: What the hell’s all this? 
Andy: Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato. 
Harry: You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one’s that guy?
 
Jim: The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Dwight: Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to – how do I put this – steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud. 
Jim: Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money. 
Dwight: Yes. 
Jim: Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
 
Dwight: [pointing at Toby] There he is. That’s Lloyd. 
Toby: Me? 
Creed: Yeah, you.
 
Harry: Where do you get off crossing state lines? 
Toby: Now, we’re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
 
Toby: I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn’t back down from anybody. And he calls people “Kimosabe”.
 
Harry: They’re New York. We’re New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That’s the way it’s always been. 
Jim: There’s actually not a rule that says that. 
Dwight: That’s true. 
Toby: That’s true. There’s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands? 
Toby: No. 
Dwight: Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could’ve choked so many people by now. 
Harry: Stay out of my state. It’s in your best interest to stay out of my state. 
Toby: I’ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast. 
Harry: Just stay out of New York, Lloyd. 
Toby: Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside] 
Jim: How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this? 
Harry: Robert’s here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don’t think we were doing that. 
Dwight: Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim’s leg.
 
Robert: Where’s the Advil, Jim? I think I’ve hit my limit on the Tylenol – Oh. 
Andy: [Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim. 
Robert: Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida? 
Andy: Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries. 
Robert: Oh, for god – 
Harry: Robert California. What a surprise you’re here in Scranton. 
Robert: Harry… 
Harry: So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place? 
Robert: How do you mean? 
Andy: I forgot, a… a pan, uh – 
Harry: No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead. 
Robert: Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There’s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems… so poorly timed. 
Dwight: Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say. 
Harry: Listen, Robert, I don’t have time. There’s a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions – 
Dwight: Don’t listen to him. 
Harry: Used to be Binghamton’s – 
Dwight: Nope. 
Harry: I want it, it’s mine. 
Dwight: Prestige is ours. Okay, they’re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert. 
Harry: We need you to make a decision. 
Dwight: Make a decision. 
Robert: I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said… [Andy walks out]
 
Andy: Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
 
Robert: Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? [camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I’ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.
 
Harry: Is it just me or is our boss a freakin’ weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I’m gonna get some air. 
Dwight: Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first. 
Jim: [Gets up and looks out Nellie’s office window] He’s running! 
Dwight: Damn it! 
Jim: Damn it.
 
Dwight: Wha – what is this supposed to be? 
Jim: It’s a monkey. 
Dwight: Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It’s got a hula skirt and a blue nose. 
Jim: Hold on, hold on. Is this him? 
Dwight: What? 
Jim: Is that him? 
Dwight: It’s him! Do something! Get out! 
Jim: What? What am I gonna do? I don’t – 
Dwight: Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That’s it? Oh, that’s great. That’s like a five second delay. 
Jim: Dwight! 
Dwight: Come on, let’s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos. 
Jim: Nos? You mean like in fast and furious? 
Dwight: Yeah. 
Jim: Oh, yeah, definitely have nos. 
Dwight: Hit the nos. 
Jim: Are you sure? 
Dwight: Yes. 
Jim: Brace yourself. 3… 2… 
Dwight: Got it. Go. 
Jim: 1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]
 
Andy: Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O. 
Receptionist: Oh, do you have an appointment? 
Andy: No, I do not. 
Receptionist: Okay, I think I can squeeze you in. 
Andy: Seriously? ‘Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you. 
Receptionist: He’s really not that busy. 
Mr. Ramish: Is there someone here to see me? 
Receptionist: Yes, this man. 
Mr. Ramish: Come on in. [Andy walks in]
 
Pam: So…what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight? 
Nellie: Oh. Oh, I’ll tell you what he does. 
Angela:: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don’t worry, I won’t lay an egg.
 
Angela:: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
 
Angela:: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk. 
Gabe: Did someone say girl talk?
 
Gabe: Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
 
Gabe: Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I’m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines. 
Nellie: Do you think I’d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish? 
Gabe: Uh, I think you’re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It’ll be upsetting if you don’t.
 
Andy: I’m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs. 
Mr. Ramish: Why haven’t I heard of you? You got any references? 
Andy: No. I’m a rogue. 
Mr. Ramish: Uh-huh. 
Andy: Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now… [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime. 
Mr. Ramish: Every salesman I’ve ever met has given me his personal phone number. 
Andy: Of course they have. Which is why I’m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need – anytime, night or day – you just stop on by. 
Mr. Ramish: You want me to drive to your house if I need paper. 
Andy: Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe… you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
 
Dwight: Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together] 
Dwight: [Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator] 
Jim: You all right? 
Dwight: Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh. 
Jim: Ah! [Harry walks in] 
Jim: [Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing? 
Dwight: Go, go! Take the stairs! Now! 
Jim: What are you talking about? 
Dwight: Just run! Take the stairs! 
Jim: I don’t even know where the stairs are! 
Dwight: I’ll stall him. Go! 
Jim: God! 
Harry: [Dwight jumping] What are you doing? 
Dwight: I’m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We’ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down. 
Jim: What? 
Dwight: My pants fell down! I don’t have a belt!
 
Dwight: [walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. 
Mr. Ramish: What’s going on? 
Dwight: Well – 
Harry: Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse – 
Dwight: I was here first. 
Mr. Ramish: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. 
Dwight: I already made an appointment… with your secretary. 
Mr. Ramish: Let me stop you all right here. I’ve already picked a new paper supplier. 
Dwight: Wait, it’s not D.M Utica, is it? 
Mr. Ramish: No, no, it’s not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It’s… Big Red Paper Company. 
Jim: Big Red Paper Company? 
Mr. Ramish: Mm-hmm.
 
Andy: Yes, yes, yes!
 
Harry: Give me a cup of coffee. 
Dwight: Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst? 
Jim: All right, guys. It didn’t work out for any of us, so… we’re still on the same team. Let me get these. 
Dwight: No. Let him get his own. It’s Syracuse money. 
Harry: You know, your partner’s got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating? 
Dwight: Jim couldn’t land me in a thousand years. 
Jim: But you’re saying there’s a chance. 
Dwight: Shut up.
 
Pam: [Walks into conference room] Hey. 
Robert: Hmm. 
Pam: I stole Nellie’s phone. 
Robert: Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
Pam: What do you want from me? 
Robert: Now we get to the bottom of Nellie’s “yes, yes, yes, yes, never.” 
Phone: Hi, Nell, it’s mom. Do keep your chin up. It can’t be as bad as you described. 
Robert: Oh yes it can. 
Phone: This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections. 
Robert: Shopaholic. 
Pam: Sounds like it. 
Robert: Yeah. 
Phone: Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you? 
Robert: Ah. 
Phone: This is Annie from second nests. I’m sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we’re gonna hold out for that. 
Pam: Okay, that’s enough. [grabs phone] 
Robert: Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this. 
Pam: No, no, no! 
Robert: No, come on. 
Pam: Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They’re all deleted. 
Robert: Pam, Pam, you’ve completely bungled this! 
Pam: Ah. Ahh. [walks out]
 
Pam: Hey. 
Nellie: Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal? 
Pam: Um… yes. Definitely. With your hair – 
Nellie: Oh! 
Pam: Certainly. Um… you dropped your cell phone. 
Nellie: Oh, gosh. 
Pam: Yep. 
Nellie: Thank you. I’m… so stupid. 
Pam: No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything. 
Nellie: Oh, god, Pam. Don’t get me started. 
Pam: No, I will not. 
Nellie: You’ve just got me started. Robert… is… a filthy beast. I mean, don’t you get the feeling, he’s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you? 
Pam: Well – 
Nellie: I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex. 
Pam: But sometimes he talks about flesh… and bacchanals. 
Nellie: I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night. 
Pam: No… don’t. Just put it out of your mind. 
Nellie: Pam, what is your address? I’m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don’t – 
Nellie: Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
 
Nellie: Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And… I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
 
Robert: [Erin opens door] Erin. 
Erin: There’s a call for you on line one. 
Robert: Who is it? 
Erin: He says salvation. No last name. 
Robert: Yeah, hello? 
Andy: [in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don’t, and I will find another buyer. 
Robert: You’re blackmailing me. 
Andy: It’s just business. 
Robert: Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You’re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don’t even know my real name. I’m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects] 
Andy: Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house] 
David: [opens door] Andy Bernard. 
Andy: You got a minute? 
David: Um… I’m in the middle of a piano lesson. 
Andy: I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin. 
David: Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now… why would I want that? It’s worth half of what it was three years ago. 
Andy: Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today. 
David: Why don’t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
 
Harry: So what would you do if you weren’t selling paper? 
Jim: Oh, man, I’d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions. 
Dwight: What? 
Jim: Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine. 
Dwight: How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don’t even care about nationals. 
Harry: Nothing? 
Jim: I don’t know. I’ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you? 
Harry: I’d like to sell one big thing, you know? Like… a plane. One sale, I’m out. 
Jim: That sounds lovely. 
Harry: Anyway, Robert’s gonna run this company into the ground, so… We won’t be doing this in six months.

Oscar: [to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um- 
Phyllis: What's he doing? 
Dwight: He's searching out younger gays. 
Phyllis: Oh. 
Oscar: No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead. 
Dwight: ...with you. [chuckles] 
Oscar: No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I- 
Kelly: Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam. 
Oscar: Do you not own a mirror? 
Kelly: Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies. 
Pam: I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things. 
Kelly: I'm throwing out all my mirrors. 
Oscar: Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple- 
Robert: No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist- 
Oscar: It's not misleading. 
Robert: -pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as "normal." It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated. 
Kevin: Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers] 
Robert: Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God! 
Dwight: You okay, Robert? 
Robert: Fine. 
Dwight: Put some ice on it. 
Oscar: In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
 
Sasha: One, two, three!
 
Dwight: I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, "muffin basket." Then I thought, "What’s even more precious to people than muffins?"
 
Jake: Can you just smile, please? 
Meredith: I don't want to!
 
Dwight: ...their own children.
 
Dwight: Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel? 
Angela: No thank you. 
Dwight: Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them. 
Jim: I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
 
Jim: Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
 
Dwight: [Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
 
Jim: Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
 
Darryl: Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
Hide: Bad economy. Bad investment. 
Darryl: You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals? 
Calvin: They did not. 
Darryl: And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it. 
Calvin: I wouldn't. 
Darryl: Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that? 
Hide: Coconut penis. 
Darryl: The coconut's pretty subtle. 
Calvin: Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no? 
Darryl: I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
 
Darryl: If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
 
Andy: [wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys. 
Jim: How's it going, man? 
Andy: [whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you? 
Jim: Great, yeah, good. 
Gabe: Oh, how the mediocre have fallen. 
Nellie: Oh God. 
Andy: Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants... 
Nellie: No, you don't understand- 
Andy: Clean the toilets. 
Nellie: I don't need anyone to- 
Andy: Pull the poop out of the toilets. 
Nellie: That's not even a thing. 
Andy: Just, please... 
Nellie: Andy. 
Andy: Please! 
Nellie: Andy. 
Andy: Give me something! 
Nellie: Why don't you clean the carpets for today? 
Andy: Thank you. 
Nellie: You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is. 
Andy: Thank you. 
Nellie: You don't need to-
 
Andy: I have a delicious secret.
 
Creed: Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping. 
Jim: Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet? 
Andy: Yeah, it is actually.
 
Andy: Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
 
Pam: [enters with the kids] Family picture! 
Jim: Pam? No! 
Pam: What? Honey, we talked about this. 
Jim: No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap. 
Pam: Yes, and then we decided that was crazy. 
Jim: No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it. 
Pam: No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember? 
Jim: Nope. 
Pam: We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child. 
Jim: But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are. 
Pam: No, no. 
Jim: Nope. 
Pam: But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them. 
Jim: That's- 
Pam: Yes! 
Jim: That's- 
Pam: And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y. 
Jim: Okay. 
Kevin: Wait, C-R-A-Z...
 
Dwight: Great, right up there. 
Pam: Yeah? 
Jim: Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go. 
Pam: Okay. 
Jim: Alright. Why don't you just- 
Pam: Oh, great. Thank you. 
Jim: -give him to me and... perfect. 
Pam: Okay. 
Jim: This is great. 
Pam: You ready? 
Jim: Excuse me. 
Pam: There we go. 
Jim: Just do it. 
Pam: I'll just stand here? 
Jim: Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great. 
Photographer: Sir, could you look into the camera? 
Jim: Let's do it, shoot it. 
Photographer: Sir. 
Jim: Great. 
Dwight: Up here. [whistles] 
Jim: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Dwight: Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good. 
Jim: Oh, so that's it? 
Dwight: That's it. 
Pam: See? That wasn't so hard. 
Dwight: Cute kids, thanks for coming.
 
Senator Lipton: Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody. 
Angela: Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing? 
Senator Lipton: Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op. 
Phyllis: [laughs] Yeah. 
Angela: Heh. 
Erin: Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor] 
Senator Lipton: Thanks.
 
Dwight: Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela. 
Angela: Dwight. 
Dwight: Nice to see you. May I hold him? 
Senator Lipton: Sure. 
Angela: No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
 
Angela: I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
 
Angela: [Phillip cries] See the duckie! 
Dwight: Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place. 
Senator Lipton: Oh, thank you. 
Angela: [slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is. 
Dwight: Really?
 
Andy: This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.
 
Andy: Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup. 
Nellie: Well, I don't want any soup. 
Andy: But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh! 
Nellie: Oh come on, Andy!
 
Erin: I know this is going to be a great payoff. 
Andy: A delicious moment. 
Erin: But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake. 
Andy: Well, but it- 
Erin: Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
 
Dwight: Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me- 
Angela: Uh-uh, leave us alone. 
Senator Lipton: I guess we're okay with the fingernails. 
Dwight: Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well? 
Angela: Dwight, we're fine! 
Senator Lipton: Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie? 
Angela: Oh no. [laughs] 
Senator Lipton: I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second. 
Dwight: He defecated, aw. 
Senator Lipton: You're stinky.
 
Darryl: A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that? 
Brandon: That's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that. 
Val: Uh, Brandon? 
Darryl: I would. 
Brandon: You would? 
Darryl: Yeah. 
Brandon: Sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend. 
Val: Calm down, he's not. 
Darryl: Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page. 
Brandon: [scoffs] So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant? 
Val: Brandon! 
Darryl: Good slam. 
Brandon: Thank you, Biggie. 
Darryl: Good luck to you. 
Brandon: Oh, and have a burger for me.
 
Senator Lipton: Okay, shall we take a few more? 
Angela: I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight. 
Senator Lipton: Okay. There we go.
 
Angela: No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
 
Dwight: Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
 
Toby: Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
Nellie: You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably. 
Andy: I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine. 
Jim: No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk... 
Erin: No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me. 
Nellie: What? 
Pam: You hit her? 
Andy: No. That is not the deal. Calibrate. 
Erin: He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me- 
Andy: That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest. 
Gabe: [enters] Happy birthday to Gabe! 
Nellie: Oh, get out, skeleton man! 
Toby: I can refer you to someone to talk to. 
Andy: [his phone rings] Huh? Hold on. 
Toby: Give you a name or- 
Andy: I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back! 
Jim: Oh boy. 
Pam: Oh, Andy. 
Oscar: What? 
Andy: I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back. 
Oscar: David Wallace hasn't worked here in years. 
Andy: Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum "Suck It" to the U.S. military.
Jim: Andy, come on. 
Kevin: Even I know that's weird. 
Andy: I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy. 
Toby: Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy. 
Andy: Stop saying my name. 
Erin: No, he's not making this up. 
Andy: Thank you, Erin. 
Erin: Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time. 
Pam: But have you ever actually seen him yourself? 
Erin: Oh my God. 
Andy: Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace. 
Toby: Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
 
Dwight: [into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
 
Kelly: Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there. 
Ravi: I do adore you.
 
Robert: Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this. 
Andy: Yeah, I know. 
Robert: Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why'd they add coconut? I miss original. 
Jim: Hey. 
Others: Hey! 
David: Hey guys, long time. 
Pam: David, what are you doing here? 
Phyllis: Is it true you're buying the company? 
David: Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy- 
Andy: What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager? 
David: I'll get to that in a second, Andy. 
Andy: But it's- it is- it is me? Right? 
David: Yes, as we've discussed- 
Andy: What? 
David: But it's very possible- 
Andy: Oh my God! 
David: Probable. 
Andy: Wow. From janitor to manager? 
David: Yep. 
Andy: That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P. 
David: There's an official announcement, a few details to be- 
Andy: From total loss to total boss, I mean- 
Stanley: Can we expect any payroll interruptions? 
David: Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
 
Andy: I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
 
Phyllis: So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore? 
David: Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company. 
Robert: Oof. [laughs] Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. [laughs] I'm actually the CEO. 
David: Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there. 
Robert: Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess. 
David: Well, okay. Great to meet you. 
Robert: Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis. 
David: Pleasure. 
Robert: I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place. 
David: That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that. 
Robert: Please. [laughs] 
Andy: Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place. 
Jim: Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy. 
Andy: Gosh, I hope so.
 
Angela: No! God, Mose! God! 
Mose: Hi, Angela. 
Angela: Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he? 
Mose: I'm not supposed to say. 
Angela: Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
 
Darryl: [taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val] 
Val: [stands next to him] Right here? 
Darryl: Cool.
 
Andy: Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
 
Nellie: May I say one thing? 
Andy: It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind. 
Nellie: The quality of mercy is not strained. 
Andy: No. 
Nellie: It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath. 
Andy: Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card? 
Nellie: It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
 
Andy: I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
 
Andy: If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well? 
Nellie: Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want. 
Andy: All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
 
David: Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him. 
Meredith: Ouch. That's gotta hurt! 
David: But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important. 
Robert: David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women. 
David: I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me. 
Robert: Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom. 
Andy: Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts? 
Robert: Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun. 
Andy: Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips] 
Robert: It's been a great year.
 
Dwight: Hello. 
Angela: Where is it? 
Dwight: They're testing it now. 
Angela: How long does it take to get the results? 
Dwight: Seventy-two hours. 
Angela: You're gonna wait here? 
Dwight: Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand] 
Angela: [Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
 
Senator Lipton: Hey. 
Oscar: Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you? 
Senator Lipton: You didn't call. 
Oscar: Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me... 
Senator Lipton: You know what this is about. [covers Phillip's eyes] Call.
