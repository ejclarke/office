
 .CONFESSION: I don t know what I m doing. 
 Okay. Goodnight, and good luck. 
#1:  You have to go with me. 
#1: But in the big picture... 
#1: But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax... 
#1: By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years. 
#1: Call me. 
#1: Did you say you ve got AIDS? 
#1: I killed it. Businessman 
#1: Senator, were always gay, or did your wife turn you gay? Reporter 
#1: Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world? 
#1: So the workspace looks awesome. 
#1: Stay. Stay, please? 
#1: Uh, we're the Jersey State Varsity Basketball team. Northeast Regional Champs. All 
#1: Yeah? 
#1: Yes, very rude. 
#2: And the graphic designer is going to be sending in some of the logo treatments. I can t wait to see them. Businessman 
#2: But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain? 
#2: Has anyone ever come back? 
#2: I just thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ. 
#2: I thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ. 
#2: I ve also been running the numbers and between our backers and our own investments, we re looking great for a full year on this. 
#2: Question for the Senator s beard. 
#2: Uh sure. No problem. 
#2: We're not going unless we can all go. 
#2: What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain? 
#2: Wow, well what level of investment were you thinking about? 
#2: You re very rude. Parent in audience 
#3: ...What? 
#3: He reminded us today of how much he means to us. And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, here s an old Treble classic. 
#3: How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger? 
#3: I really didn t know that man. I just thought you wanted to hear it. 
#3: I thought you were Adam Lambert. 
#3: It s Mr. Andy Bernard! 
#3: Look, I know it was big with the old guys, but-- 
#3: No. 
#3: Now folks, by special request, we re going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room. 
#3: Oh Jim, I explained everything. So you re all set. 
#3: She said you wanted to hear  Faith . That s Broccoli Rob s signature song. 
#3: We don t know it. 
#3: Welcome aboard! 
#3: Yeah, I got a call from Broccoli Rob. I guess you really are the Boner Champ. 
#3: You guys rock.  Businessman 
:   This close. 
: ) P.S. I finally finished my summer project. 
: Absolutely,  not.  Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job. 
: Alright.  
: Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work? 
: Customer service might be monitoring this conversation. 
: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry. 
: Uh, is that it? 
: When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, "Something Weird is Going On." Colon, "What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute." 
: Yeah? 
: You're just out of business? 
1: All right. Warehouse guy 
1: Do you have any weapons? 
1: Down the hall. VRG 
1: Dude! Your shirt tucked in? 
1: Forget the sandwich. Girls. Girls. 
1: Hey Creed. 
1: Hey, how ya doin'? 
1: Hi, we received a call? 
1: How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv? David 
1: How much longer is this gonna take? 
1: I need a job. 
1: Let's do it, man. 
1: No. 
1: Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance? 
1: Oh, tiny, poor lady is back. Oh, get the baby clipper.  Nail stylist 
1: Okay I can tell that your time is valuable--- 
1: Okay I'm not going to argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck dude. 
1: Or a woman. 
1: Really? Police Officer 
1: Salad dressing? Police Officer 
1: Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America? 
1: Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here? 
1: Sir? 
1: That all sounds really, really ambitious. 
1: That manipulates the secondary shaft. 
1: That sounds great. 
1: That's what we came up with. 
1: The other room? VRG 
1: There's girl in there. Vance Refrigeration Guy 
1: Turn around. 
1: Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we d all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead? 
1: Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit? 
1: We got a fake tip. 
1: We were tipped off about a possible narcotics situation. 
1: Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative. 
1: We're here to bust you out! 
1: What'd I just say? VRG 
1: Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch? 
1: Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we have some leeway. 
1: You wanna press charges? 
1: You would be a great one to buy an auger with. 
17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five.   Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep.   
2:  You take off your glasses. 
2: All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into that  he could do anything. Anything. 
2: All right, next time dude. 
2: Check this out. 
2: Dude, you should review movies.  
2: Hey Michael, nice to meet you 
2: Hey, Michael. 
2: I hear ya. What did it say? 
2: Like a driver's license? 
2: No. 
2: Okay, when should we come back? 
2: Pam, what was in that teapot letter? 
2: See you later. 
2: Sir, can you step away from your desk please? 
2: Sir, please step away from your desk. 
2: Some basil. Salad dressing, I think. Police Officer 
2: The neighbors said they heard some shouting. 
2: There's girls in there? VRG 
2: This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog. 
2: Uh, no. Man 
2: We should buy an auger together. 
2: We were sent here to help out. Ad guy 
2: Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually. Ad guy 
2: What other room? VRG 
2: Where? VRG 
2: Yeah it's, uh, a caprese salad. There's a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there. 
2: Yeah, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. Do you wanna come? Co-Worker 
2: You have another sandwich? VRG 
2: You know you don't have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet. 
2: Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl. 
2: You're the man buddy. 
3: Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody s actually filming you anymore? 
3: I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate? 
3: Really? 
3: We'd love for you to come, Michael. 
3: What's it about? 
4: I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you re soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia? 
4: Like Harry Potter. 
5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school. We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians.. 
A.J.:   
A.J.:   I'm a salesman. That's why I raised my hand. 
A.J.: A.J. 
A.J.: Does what feel good? 
A.J.: Excuse me? 
A.J.: It's pretty serious, yes. 
A.J.: No, what are you talking about? 
A.J.: Yeah. Why, are you interested?   
ABBY: Alright. 
ABBY: Definitely the Aquarium. 
ABBY: Do you want to come over for dinner tonight? 
ABBY: From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. 
ABBY: Mmhmm! 
ABBY: No thanks. 
ABBY: Sure. 
ABBY: That doesn't sound like a show. 
ABBY: That's not fair.  
ABBY: Why not? 
ABBY: Yeah, but I've read it before. 
ABBY: Yeah. 
ABE: Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes.  
ACTOR: Hey, Rach. Redheaded 
ACTOR: Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead? 
ACTOR: I'm not even in the scene! 
ACTRESS: Again!? 
ACTRESS: Hey, Joe. Mike. 
AD:  It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up.  Because ideas spread, they change, grow. They connect us with the world.  And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time , and bad news isn't always what it seems.  Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance.  To score.  Dunder Mifflin. Limitless paper in a paperless world. 
ADVICE: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim? 
AGAINST: a twelve year old female bully. 
AGENDA: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client. 
AGENT: I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe? 
AIKEN: Listen, all right, thank you very much, we re not interested. 
AIKEN: No, we do not want to hear you sing. 
AJ: For us. 
AJ: Great. 
AJ: He smells awful. 
AJ: Hey Michael. 
AJ: Hey, what happened to Woody? 
AJ: Hi. 
AJ: I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist. 
AJ: I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but... 
AJ: I wanted to see you. How are you? 
AJ: I'd love an iced tea, actually. 
AJ: I'm, uh, I'm AJ. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise. 
AJ: Is everyone here kind of mean? 
AJ: Just now. 
AJ: Just now. Hey, Michael. 
AJ: Michael.   
AJ: Oh, God, you look great. 
AJ: Oh. 
AJ: Pleased to see you. Thank you. 
AJ: Surprise. 
AJ: Was I supposed to bring you guys something? 
AJ: We're designing a house. 
AJ: Yeah, it was great. 
AJ: You guys are really gonna do this? 
AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby. 
AL: Nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn't know! 
AL: Oh! 
AL: Oh, I... I don't... I'm not sure. 
AL: Okay, Okay. Where are we going? 
AL: Phyllis and you will be great together. 
AL: The Celtics were a great team. 
AL: Who? 
ALAN:  Freedom fries for the table. 
ALAN: ... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager. 
ALAN: Alright, guys. You ready? 
ALAN: Dunder Mifflin is still a strong company. We are poised to come through this more streamlined and profitable than ever.  
ALAN: In these uncertain times, Michael has managed to maintain steady profits from his Scranton branch. We all thank you, Michael.  Another bright spot in the Dunder Mifflin landscape, our new waste pulp re-purposing plant in Milford.  
ALAN: It's nice to meet you, Michael. 
ALAN: Oh, great. 
ALAN: Ok. We're gonna take a 15 minute break and then we're gonna answer more questions. Third 
ALAN: Okay. 
ALAN: Quiet! Quiet, please! Please, quiet! Quiet, please. We want to hear your questions. 
ALAN: See, this one is great, because it can work on a couple of different levels. 
ALAN: Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions. 
ALAN: The gentleman in the, uh, glasses. 
ALAN: The shareholders need to empower our leadership - Woman in 
ALAN: Well, I just, uh... I kinda think about stuff that I see, or dream them. 
ALAN: Who cares? 
ALAN: Yeah. 
ALAN: Yeah. I mean, people always say, like, "Don't be edgy." But I don't know any other way. Yeah, you get it. 
ALAN: Yeah. Next time bring some of your illustrations, I'll let you pick my brain. 
ALAN: You were supposed to wave. 
ALBA:   I want you to meet my nana. Nana... 
ALBA: This is Sam. 
ALBINY:  And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits. 
ALBINY: Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here. 
ALERT: I'm gonna win. 
ALEX:   Um. 
ALEX: I know. But all I'm saying is, if there's even a teeny, tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist, then I think you should stay here, because you don't want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been. And that is the end of my speech. I planned it all. Anyway ... I will see you tomorrow. 
ALEX: I'm gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton. 
ALEX: It's Pam. Uh, I came to kidnap you. There's free wine and cheese at the Chuck Close retrospective. Let's go. 
ALEX: OK.   
ALEX: Pam Beesley? 
ALEX: Right. And that's why I think that you should stay here. Because I mean, you -- really you just got here, you know? You can't do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. It has -- all the opportunity is here. All the -- the whole art scene is in New York. You know, it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it. 
ALEX: Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee? Jim and 
ALEX: Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it? 
ALEX: Why did you come to New York in the first place? 
ALICE: Because I had to wait-  
ALICE: He is not a very sophisticated man, I mean he can't even use chopsticks, so. Do I need to say anything else? 
ALICE: He worked as a librarian freshman year. 
ALICE: Hi. 
ALICE: Hi. 
ALICE: Hi.  Good. I'd love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing p- 
ALICE: History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years. 
ALICE: How's that P.E. degree coming? That's what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher. 
ALICE: I wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?! 
ALICE: I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard. 
ALICE: Is there like somebody who's in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her. 
ALICE: It's uh, been a while, huh? 
ALICE: Nice to meet you. Cute sweater. 
ALICE: Ok, great. Thanks. 
ALICE: Ok, while we're rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem. 
ALICE: Pete? 
ALICE: So there's no marketing department. 
ALICE: So you're dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete. 
ALICE: Yeah you're also supposed to go to classes, so there's that.

ANDY:   A throne for your highness. 
ANDY:   Are you blind?! Are you blind?!   Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger. 
ANDY:   Consider yourself... at home! 
ANDY:   Dwight. 
ANDY:   Everybody Dance Now", spins in chair] Oww! 
ANDY:   Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just...   No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday. 
ANDY:   Harry and the Henderson's 
ANDY:   Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.   There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance.   
ANDY:   Hey-oh!

ANDY:   What about a nice sushi place? Maybe a place with a view? 
ANDY:   What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.

ANDY:  Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us. 
ANDY:  Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please. 
ANDY:  Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following 
ANDY:  Giddy up, let's do this. 
ANDY:  Good luck, Darryl. 
ANDY:  Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy! 
ANDY:  Got any hot leads? 
ANDY:  Great job everyone, that was fantastic.  
ANDY:  Halvsies? 
ANDY:  Hand roll. 
ANDY:  Handbag. 
ANDY:  Hardcore Parkour! 
ANDY:  Hate the twirl! 
ANDY:  Have a seat yourself. 
ANDY:  Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball!  You throw a lovely party ma lady... 
ANDY:  Hello, hey hang on a second. Hello, hang on. 
ANDY:  Hello. 
ANDY:  Hello? 
ANDY:  Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello? 
ANDY:  Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours! 
ANDY:  Hey Creed, would you read Chinese? 
ANDY:  Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here.  
ANDY:  Hey Robert, are we meeting early? 
ANDY:  Hey there young lady. 
ANDY:  Hey!  Good job boss! 
ANDY:  Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around!  Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach.  They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh.  This computer's a hunk of jjunk. 
ANDY:  Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out.  
ANDY:  Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to? It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know. 
ANDY:  Hey, do you need a lozenge? 
ANDY:  Hey, everybody, great job.  Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks. 
ANDY:  Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you re never fully dressed without a smile.  Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly  
ANDY:  Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away. 
ANDY:  Hey. 
ANDY:  Hi Dad!...... Ahhh .oh boy. 
ANDY:  Hi Dwight. 
ANDY:  Hi guys. 
ANDY:  Hi Tuna. 
ANDY:  Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you. 
ANDY:  Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of  95. Hey there, um, I m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations.   
ANDY:  Hi. Girl at 
ANDY:  Hi. You re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You re like, my three favorite people ever. 
ANDY:  Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card . 
ANDY:  How may I be of service to you? 
ANDY:  Huh? Hold on. 
ANDY:  I  it s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him,  I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.  Smart, right? 
ANDY:  I am so horny. 
ANDY:  I am so hungry!  
ANDY:  I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire. David 
ANDY:  I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!! 
ANDY:  I did it. 
ANDY:  I didn't do it! 
ANDY:  I don't even know what the truth is anymore. 
ANDY:  I don't trust you, Phyllis! 
ANDY:  I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That s final. 
ANDY:  I have been dreaming of this moment. 
ANDY:  I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation... 
ANDY:  I like tea! 
ANDY:  I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan. 
ANDY:  I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain. Andy and 
ANDY:  I m gonna miss you too. Mmm! 
ANDY:  I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom. 
ANDY:  I think he's got it! 
ANDY:  I think we've got ourselves an answer. 
ANDY:  I think you guys might have the wrong Office. 
ANDY:  I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day. 
ANDY:  I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where-  
ANDY:  I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children... 
ANDY:  I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains. 
ANDY:  I will see you at the inter-view. 
ANDY:  Idiot! 
ANDY:  If you change your mind, I'll be first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me let me know, gonna be around. If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down. If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me. Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try. Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela. Take a chance on me. Voice #1 on 
ANDY:  I'll be your croak madame. 
ANDY:  I'll see you in three weeks! 
ANDY:  I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you? 
ANDY:  I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions.  
ANDY:  In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed. 
ANDY:  It s a Nard Dog!  That s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it! 
ANDY:  It's freezing out here. 
ANDY:  It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed. 
ANDY:  Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute? 
ANDY:  Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott.  
ANDY:  Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance!  Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor? 
ANDY:  Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better. 
ANDY:  Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here...  
ANDY:  Listen, I don t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day. 
ANDY:  Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies. 
ANDY:  Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper? 
ANDY:  May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger...  ah!  It's working.  It's... I knew it! 
ANDY:  Michael & 
ANDY:  Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there.  What?  
ANDY:  My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble- Andy & 
ANDY:  Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here. 
ANDY:  Nice comeback! 
ANDY:  Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math. 
ANDY:  No it's a... hump. There's a hump. 
ANDY:  No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent,  I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like. 
ANDY:  No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah. 
ANDY:  No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna! 
ANDY:  No. 
ANDY:  Nothing is impossible to him who will try.  Alexander the Great, if he were cockney. 
ANDY:  Now, carefully... open the box. 
ANDY:  Oh man. 
ANDY:  Oh my god. I forgive him so much.  Whoa, is he choking? 
ANDY:  Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you. 
ANDY:  Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody! 
ANDY:  Oh, yes indeed... When!  Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads!  When! 
ANDY:  Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one. 
ANDY:  Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels... 
ANDY:  Ok, we ready?  Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up. 
ANDY:  Okay, adjective... 
ANDY:  Okay. 
ANDY:  Okay. 
ANDY:  Okay. 
ANDY:  Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour. 
ANDY:  Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis. 
ANDY:  Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar? 
ANDY:  One for you. 
ANDY:  Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! 
ANDY:  Ow, ow! 
ANDY:  Ow. 
ANDY:  Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer? 
ANDY:  Parkour! 
ANDY:  Parkour! Parkour! 
ANDY:  Pfft. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is a bitch. 
ANDY:  Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na- 
ANDY:  Please Mr. President- 
ANDY:  Please Mr. President, if you wanna give hope a whirl, bring our troops home safe and sound, says this little girl. 
ANDY:  Pretty sneaky sis.  
ANDY:  Puts pillow in front of the puke. 
ANDY:  Really uncomfortable situation. 
ANDY:  Right on, brotha. Wurddd. 
ANDY:  Rudit-do-do-do-di-do. 
ANDY:  Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming! 
ANDY:  Saying I love you is not the words... 
ANDY:  She's gonna be so psyched. 
ANDY:  Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper?  
ANDY:  Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call. 
ANDY:  Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray. 
ANDY:  so it just goes on under here like this? 
ANDY:  So this is a single. 
ANDY:  So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee... 
ANDY:  Something's definitely wrong. 
ANDY:  Sorry, not Jim. 
ANDY:  Sorry. 
ANDY:  Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut! 
ANDY:  Stop the bus! Stop the bus! 
ANDY:  Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said? 
ANDY:  Sweetheart, you re amazing, okay? You re obviously gonna be on the show, so it s someone else s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right,  my name is Ezra Cornell and I m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart. Aaron 
ANDY:  Take that, kid. 
ANDY:  Tank you Mr. Elwis. 
ANDY:  That is the stupidest thing you could do right now! 
ANDY:  That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level. 
ANDY:  That's my girlfriend you're talking about. 
ANDY:  That's probably good. That's enough. 
ANDY:  That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter. 
ANDY:  That's the other thing you got to watch out...  Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott. 
ANDY:  The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?" 
ANDY:  The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that s good because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general. But I guess it s really more like they re just people who work in an office and I m their manager. Yeah that s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it. 
ANDY:  These sure are pretty dogs... 
ANDY:  They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding! 
ANDY:  This aurea is a joke. 
ANDY:  This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. 
ANDY:  This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death. 
ANDY:  Time to have a little kiss! 
ANDY:  Toby, how did we do? 
ANDY:  Totally! 
ANDY:  Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit. 
ANDY:  Tuna, how come you never try to set me up? 
ANDY:  Two crazy kids on the journey of life. 
ANDY:  Ugh! Fine. Did you see this?  
ANDY:  Uh, 93 million miles. 
ANDY:  Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes. 
ANDY:  Up she goes! Boat 
ANDY:  Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick.  Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy...  I'm making a sale. Sales. 
ANDY:  Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...  
ANDY:  We had to let a warehouse guy go?! 
ANDY:  We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad. 
ANDY:  Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is- 
ANDY:  Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah. 
ANDY:  Well, what can t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn t noticed, I ve got a pretty good British accent. 
ANDY:  We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress.  
ANDY:  What are you doing? 
ANDY:  What do I know? 
ANDY:  What is going on? 
ANDY:  What is love? 
ANDY:  What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there. 
ANDY:  What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on.  Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy!  All right. Back to work. 
ANDY:  What's up, Josh? 
ANDY:  Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202. 
ANDY:  Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great! 
ANDY:  Where you going? 
ANDY:  Which me am I gonna be today? 
ANDY:  Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school? 
ANDY:  Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil? 
ANDY:  Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop! 
ANDY:  Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God! 
ANDY:  Whoa-oh, traffic jam! 
ANDY:  Whoo! Yeah! 
ANDY:  William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do. 
ANDY:  Wow! 
ANDY:  Wow. 
ANDY:  Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. 
ANDY:  Yeah! 
ANDY:  Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage. 
ANDY:  Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss. 
ANDY:  Yeah. 
ANDY:  Yeah. Hah. Hoo. 
ANDY:  Yes! 
ANDY:  Yes. 
ANDY:  Yes.  I don't know. Mmhmm. 
ANDY:  You are very welcome. 
ANDY:  You know I can, my man. 
ANDY:  You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But... Sweeney 
ANDY:  You know, gabba-gool. 
ANDY:  You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you re about to leave Cornell. So say it with 
ANDY:  You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don t, and I will find another buyer. 
ANDY:  You re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn... 
ANDY:  You're having a party at Gabe's apartment? 
ANDY: "Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid." 
ANDY: "Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character." 
ANDY: "Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations." 
ANDY: "Crazy diarrhea happening right now?" Cause things can get real adult real fast. 
ANDY: "Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog." 
ANDY: "Seriously?" Are you serious? 
ANDY: "Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.'" 
ANDY: "Walk until you hear the beehive." 
ANDY: . Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here? 
ANDY: ... not what I meant. 
ANDY: ...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you. 
ANDY: ...And, Jim. 
ANDY: ...Erin... 
ANDY: ...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock. 
ANDY: ...my girlfriend's back! 
ANDY: ...Ryan... 
ANDY: ...So help us out. 
ANDY: ...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work. 
ANDY: ...That was weird. 
ANDY: ...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!... 
ANDY: ..The camera don't lie! 
ANDY: : Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture. 
ANDY: : Look alive. 
ANDY: 0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat! 
ANDY: 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew!  
ANDY: 250. 
ANDY: 8pm sharp. 
ANDY: A baby what? A human?! 
ANDY: A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail!  Who's this guy? Look at him dance. Fail! 
ANDY: A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in? 
ANDY: A bunch of us are talking about happy hour. 
ANDY: A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch. Mark 
ANDY: A delicious moment. 
ANDY: A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes. 
ANDY: A jitterbug.  You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions? 
ANDY: A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here? 
ANDY: A little frazzled. 
ANDY: A little warm. 
ANDY: A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael. 
ANDY: A madhouse. Sweeney 
ANDY: A minute would be cool. 
ANDY: A year. 
ANDY: Aaah!  So good! 
ANDY: Aah! Aah! It's so loud! 
ANDY: Aah! This ones hot too! 
ANDY: A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how. 
ANDY: Absolutely. 
ANDY: Actor? 
ANDY: Actually, it is. It's Latin for "earth." 
ANDY: Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf! 
ANDY: After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch. 
ANDY: After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group.  Not really my scene. 
ANDY: After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams. 
ANDY: After you. 
ANDY: Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy. 
ANDY: Agh! Son of a bitch! 
ANDY: Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it. 
ANDY: Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched. 
ANDY: Ah! My Santa suit's stuck. 
ANDY: Ah! That s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know?  
ANDY: Ah, come on! 
ANDY: Ah, it's, uh... somebody's already called that. 
ANDY: Ah, OK. 
ANDY: Ah, OK. 
ANDY: Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick.  
ANDY: Ah...  
ANDY: Ah... busted. Yes 
ANDY: Ah... sweet! 
ANDY: Ahh!  Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet. 
ANDY: Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me! 
ANDY: AHHHHH!!!!!!! 
ANDY: All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever. 
ANDY: All good, Santa. 
ANDY: All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said  You can't be a skipper until you're a man.  You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance. 
ANDY: All in! Whoo! 
ANDY: All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation. 
ANDY: All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order-- 
ANDY: All right! 
ANDY: All right! 
ANDY: All right! 
ANDY: All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel. 
ANDY: All right! We're here. Limitless can wait. 
ANDY: All right, all right, all right. 
ANDY: All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except...  
ANDY: All right, everybody's still here. Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on. Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.   Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA. Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo.   
ANDY: All right, fine, just know that you made me do this.  
ANDY: All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War. 
ANDY: All right, race to the next hole!  
ANDY: All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath. 
ANDY: All right, well thank you for my garbage computer.  
ANDY: All right, who s next? Nellie? 
ANDY: All right, yes! It's a deal. 
ANDY: All right, you sly bastard. When can you start? 
ANDY: All right. 
ANDY: All right. 
ANDY: All right. Formative years.  
ANDY: All right. I get it. 
ANDY: All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you. 
ANDY: All right. Thank you very much.  Looking good.  Who's that little fella? 
ANDY: All righty. 
ANDY: All those in favor of selling, say aye.  
ANDY: All those who agree, say aye  All those opposed - 
ANDY: All... righty, let's get started. What is she into? 
ANDY: Already? This, this guy is persistent! 
ANDY: Alright everybody, great season of softball, I'm super proud of you guys and I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together.  
ANDY: Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha. 
ANDY: Alright everybody, you are doing great! 
ANDY: Alright fine. You know what   I guess this place just hasn t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I m still going. And I m not going to ask anymore. I m not even going to look back. I m just going to assume that you re with me. 
ANDY: Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you. Do you realize that? You're the best ever! 
ANDY: Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we? 
ANDY: Alright! Here we go. 
ANDY: Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor. 
ANDY: Alright! The DM Express is pulling out. 
ANDY: Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving. 
ANDY: Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.  
ANDY: Alright, a plan it is. 
ANDY: Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay? 
ANDY: Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal. Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom. 
ANDY: Alright, I'll tell Dwight. 
ANDY: Alright, I've scoped out the joint. Those two dudes are as good as naked. 
ANDY: Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin. 
ANDY: Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat. 
ANDY: Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in?  
ANDY: Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut? 
ANDY: Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better?  Yeah. Yeah, it does. 
ANDY: Alright. 
ANDY: Alright. 
ANDY: Alright. 
ANDY: Alright.  Well hey... 
ANDY: Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work.  
ANDY: Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay. 
ANDY: Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord. 
ANDY: Alright. Well then welcome aboard. 
ANDY: Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe. 
ANDY: Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm. 
ANDY: And 
ANDY: And a high five!  Oh, let's do this again! 
ANDY: And a top of the day to you too, sir. 
ANDY: And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch. 
ANDY: And all was good in Scranton PA that day. 
ANDY: And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all. 
ANDY: And come and tell me. Doesn t matter what it is. 
ANDY: And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes. 
ANDY: And how are you on this fine-  
ANDY: And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here. 
ANDY: And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call Dwight  
ANDY: And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls? 
ANDY: And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too. 
ANDY: And I'm a director. 
ANDY: And it s getting a little more serious. She s never come by. 
ANDY: And it was open. And people saw this. And they re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is. 
ANDY: And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket. 
ANDY: And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain. 
ANDY: And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher. 
ANDY: And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden. 
ANDY: And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area. 
ANDY: And- oh. You missed your head.  There you go. Phyllis, think fast! 
ANDY: And one for you. 
ANDY: And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary. 
ANDY: And the Christmas party. 
ANDY: And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small. 
ANDY: And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done. 
ANDY: And this is where I will record your sales. 
ANDY: And those sand grains are tumbling.. 
ANDY: And where did you go? 
ANDY: And you didn't invite any of us? 
ANDY: And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants.   Ah, what'd you do that for? 
ANDY: And you know what? The guys already know it so it's easy breezy. 
ANDY: And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello. 
ANDY: And you sold it to Jan too. 
ANDY: And you will be hearing from - 
ANDY: And YOU will not be pleased with the result! 
ANDY: And your affiliation with Cornell - 
ANDY: And your stupid face!  And your stupid office!  Ah! 
ANDY: And you're fired... 
ANDY: And, they are collectively my best man. And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out. 
ANDY: And? 
ANDY: Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it s like taking a test, but I know the answers. 
ANDY: Andrew Bernard. 
ANDY: Andy Bernard 
ANDY: Andy Bernard does not lose contests. He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair. 
ANDY: Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales. 
ANDY: Andy have a boo-boo tummy. 
ANDY: Andy. What s yours? 
ANDY: Ang. Ela.   Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay-- 
ANDY: Angela Bernard. 
ANDY: Angela! 
ANDY: Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying? 
ANDY: Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it! 
ANDY: Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage?  
ANDY: Angela? 
ANDY: Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen? 
ANDY: Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge. 
ANDY: Anything. 
ANDY: Anything. You can ask me anything. 
ANDY: Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi. 
ANDY: Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance. 
ANDY: Apology not... accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place.  
ANDY: Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so,  him. 
ANDY: Are they from you? 
ANDY: Are they on their way over? 
ANDY: Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong? 
ANDY: Are we rotating seats, or? 
ANDY: Are we scaring them straight....? 
ANDY: Are we, uh... are we leaving or what?   Ow! 
ANDY: Are you a student here? 
ANDY: Are you blind?! 
ANDY: Are you factoring in the  whole national  economy . declining and all that? 
ANDY: Are you insane? It s the Cornell fight song. Clay 
ANDY: Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing. 
ANDY: Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone.  To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day.  Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys? 
ANDY: Are you kidding? 
ANDY: Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box.  
ANDY: Are you okay? 
ANDY: Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her. 
ANDY: Are you playing for the other team?! 
ANDY: Are you ready? 
ANDY: Are you saying- 
ANDY: Are you serious? 
ANDY: Are you sure that's not the "gay" ear? 
ANDY: Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes. 
ANDY: Are you sure this is the right way? 
ANDY: Are you sure? 
ANDY: Are you taking your med-meds? 
ANDY: Are you volunteering? 
ANDY: Are you... 
ANDY: As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront. 
ANDY: As in... 
ANDY: At least until Stanley calms down. 
ANDY: At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany. David 
ANDY: At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here. 
ANDY: A-team. 
ANDY: Atta boy Clark! 
ANDY: Attaboy. Good. Now, chill. 
ANDY: Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy. 
ANDY: Australian accent... 
ANDY: Aw! 
ANDY: Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go. 
ANDY: Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does. 
ANDY: Aw!! Way better a cappella 
ANDY: Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules. 
ANDY: Aw, that s cute. 
ANDY: Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in. 
ANDY: Awesome. 
ANDY: Awesome. 
ANDY: Awesome.  Plop! 
ANDY: Awkward. 
ANDY: Aww, I mean... 
ANDY: Aww. 
ANDY: Awwhh, wow. 
ANDY: Awww. Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby? 
ANDY: Aye, aye, Cap'n. 
ANDY: B-9. 
ANDY: Baby, don't hurt me! 
ANDY: Baby, don't hurt me. 
ANDY: Bah I think people thought I was kidding when I said that. 
ANDY: Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point!  
ANDY: Baseball! 
ANDY: Baseball! Go talk to him. 
ANDY: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron. 
ANDY: Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5. 
ANDY: Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot. 
ANDY: Because you suck. 
ANDY: Beer me! 
ANDY: Best ad ever.  Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing? 
ANDY: Better a cappella! 
ANDY: Better a cappella. 
ANDY: Big 
ANDY: Big day for you. 
ANDY: Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?  I graduated in four years. I never studied once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, "Here Comes Treble." 
ANDY: Birthday punches!  One two three four five sice seven eight! 
ANDY: Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down. 
ANDY: Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut. 
ANDY: Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas? 
ANDY: Books! Excellent, Jim. 
ANDY: Boo-yea!  
ANDY: Boring. Call me if she rolls over. 
ANDY: Brava, brava. 
ANDY: Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car. 
ANDY: Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon. 
ANDY: Bring it on guys. 
ANDY: Bro hug?   Back to basics. I like it. 
ANDY: Bro, I do that all the time. 
ANDY: Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ. 
ANDY: Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there. 
ANDY: Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row? 
ANDY: Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there?   One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather... 
ANDY: Bueno. 
ANDY: Bump! I bumped it! 
ANDY: Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that. Clay 
ANDY: But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down. 
ANDY: But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something? 
ANDY: But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase... 
ANDY: But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot. 
ANDY: But I just it s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn t  
ANDY: But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane. 
ANDY: But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably... 
ANDY: But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime. 
ANDY: But it's- it is- it is me? Right? 
ANDY: But it's really good-  Oh! 
ANDY: But off the record, I'm kinda confused. 
ANDY: But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon! 
ANDY: But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is. 
ANDY: But who was that guy? 
ANDY: But you're calling me a liar. 
ANDY: By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam?  
ANDY: By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work. 
ANDY: By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately. 
ANDY: Bye guys. 
ANDY: C mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously? 
ANDY: Can I inspire?  I don t know!.....I don t know.  
ANDY: Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps? 
ANDY: Can I introduce you around now? 
ANDY: Can I talk to you a minute? 
ANDY: Can I think about it? 
ANDY: Can we do sleight of hand tricks? 
ANDY: Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call. 
ANDY: Can we talk about this in private? 
ANDY: Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late. 
ANDY: can you believe this guy? 
ANDY: Can you do it? 
ANDY: Can you get the phone? 
ANDY: Can you go over those options again? 
ANDY: Can you see things with your eyeballs?! 
ANDY: Can you stand up? And talk to me over there? 
ANDY: Can't argue with that. Dwight ...   You are going to make us so happy.   
ANDY: Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video! 
ANDY: Carla Fern is not just an actor s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate. 
ANDY: Carla! Carla! 
ANDY: Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once. 
ANDY: Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call. 
ANDY: Cause that says, that says... 
ANDY: Cause you re always taking dumps. 
ANDY: 'Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised. 
ANDY: Charge!

ANDY: Come on pam! 
ANDY: Come on! 
ANDY: Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there.   Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait.   Bad decision in a glass. 
ANDY: Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time. 
ANDY: Come on, get over here. 
ANDY: Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back. 
ANDY: Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets? 
ANDY: Come on, just do it. 
ANDY: Come on, you think you can get into Cornell? 
ANDY: Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels? 
ANDY: Congratulations to you. 
ANDY: Congratulations. 
ANDY: Consider it nailed. 
ANDY: Cool! 
ANDY: Cool, thanks. 
ANDY: Cool. 
ANDY: Cool. 
ANDY: Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what I do. 
ANDY: Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee  
ANDY: Coolio. 
ANDY: Correction. It was my idea. 
ANDY: Costume vetoed. 
ANDY: Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it s really stupid, but it s also really, really, really important. Broccoli 
ANDY: Count me in! 
ANDY: Count to twen - count to twenty. 
ANDY: Covered it up. 
ANDY: Creed! Wha-  This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead! 
ANDY: Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this. 
ANDY: Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love. 
ANDY: Crystal.

ANDY: Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon! Who is slacking? 
ANDY: Darryl is a jerk. 
ANDY: Darryl said,  Cool, man.  He called me as cool man. 
ANDY: Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.

ANDY: Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese. 
ANDY: Dave Matthews. 
ANDY: David Walrus, in his native habitat. David 
ANDY: David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it. 
ANDY: David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm. 
ANDY: David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite. David

ANDY: Definition. 
ANDY: Did Donna tell you that? 
ANDY: Did he tell you how I got the name? HCT Member 
ANDY: Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park. 
ANDY: Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying... 
ANDY: Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less. 
ANDY: Did she have any last words or? 
ANDY: Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo!  
ANDY: Did the email go out or  
ANDY: 'Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch. 
ANDY: Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner?  How about now?  How about now?  How about now? 
ANDY: Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the "F" word? 
ANDY: Did you check the vending machine? 
ANDY: Did you check your... butt? 
ANDY: Did you even hear the music I just played for you? 
ANDY: Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night? 
ANDY: Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan? 
ANDY: Did you maybe tell them that or...? Broccoli 
ANDY: Did you mean a real date? 
ANDY: Did you see who did it? 
ANDY: Did you tell them? 
ANDY: Did you think I was going to fire you? No I wasn t.  I m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you. 
ANDY: Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose? 
ANDY: Didn t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo? 
ANDY: Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table. 
ANDY: Dijonnaise. 
ANDY: Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you.  Pardon moi, Messieurs. I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room. 
ANDY: Divorced? 
ANDY: Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes. Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across? Well if I do, Andy's sowwy. 
ANDY: Do it. 
ANDY: Do me! Do me! 
ANDY: Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?

ANDY: Do you know the other state? 
ANDY: Do you know why you never heard of it? 
ANDY: Do you like apples? Guy at 
ANDY: Do you like it? 
ANDY: Do you love him? 
ANDY: Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese? 
ANDY: Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay? 
ANDY: Do you think that they've ever... 
ANDY: Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends? 
ANDY: Do you think...  so you think...  Sweeney 
ANDY: Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to. 
ANDY: Do you, do you want a drawbridge? 
ANDY: Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-? 
ANDY: Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?  
ANDY: Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist? 
ANDY: Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap?  You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um... Male Applicant 
ANDY: Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system? Male Applicant 
ANDY: Does anything go on top of the mouse? 
ANDY: Does it hurt? 
ANDY: Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.

ANDY: Don't worry. There is a surefire cure. Employee of the Month. Every awesome place I've worked has had one. 
ANDY: Don't worry. You're not...

ANDY: Dr--- You can call me Drew. 
ANDY: Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news. 
ANDY: Drew.  Dwight. How's it goin' man? 
ANDY: Drew. I'm Drew now. 
ANDY: Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine. 
ANDY: Dude, that is my face! 
ANDY: Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do. 
ANDY: Dude, you struck out. They're totally stuck up. Here... drink up. 
ANDY: Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me. 
ANDY: Duh. 
ANDY: Duh. I know. That would be insane. 
ANDY: Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that. 
ANDY: Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve!  Ah OK, now a serious one. 
ANDY: Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy.  I put out some new magazines, check it out. 
ANDY: Duuudes, stop. 
ANDY: Dwight has defeated the computer. 
ANDY: Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed. 
ANDY: Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle. 
ANDY: Dwight we got five strikes. 
ANDY: Dwight why don t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals. 
ANDY: Dwight! 
ANDY: Dwight! 
ANDY: Dwight, anything? 
ANDY: Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim. 
ANDY: Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable. 
ANDY: Dwight, I have exciting news for you. 
ANDY: Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms... 
ANDY: Dwight, Jr!  
ANDY: Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory. 
ANDY: Dwight, there's just a small matter of a- 
ANDY: Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here. 
ANDY: Dwight. 
ANDY: Dwight. 
ANDY: Dwight... 
ANDY: Dwight? 
ANDY: Dwight? 
ANDY: Dwight's grandfather was a . 
ANDY: Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I  
ANDY: Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. 
ANDY: Edgy impressions. 
ANDY: EEEHHH!! No. Hehe. 
ANDY: Eh, cool. We'll figure that out. 
ANDY: Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good! 
ANDY: Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go. 
ANDY: Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is? 
ANDY: Ehh. 
ANDY: Ehh...   well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm..  Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that? 
ANDY: Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk. I saw some email. I got peepers of an eagle. 
ANDY: Eight dollars? 
ANDY: Eleanor Roosevelt once said  the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.   I think she s right.  I feel calm now.  I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I m doing the right thing. 
ANDY: End the mistakes, easy- 
ANDY: Engaging wings   
ANDY: Enngh- 
ANDY: Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to "How I Met Your Mother" that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them. 
ANDY: Erin go braugh! 
ANDY: Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one. 
ANDY: Erin I gotta go! Them's my chords! 
ANDY: Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard. 
ANDY: Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches". 
ANDY: Erin likes Gabe. 
ANDY: Erin! 
ANDY: Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist. 
ANDY: Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace. 
ANDY: Erin, how long did we order those billboards for? 
ANDY: Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto.  Are you going later? 
ANDY: Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation. 
ANDY: Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee? 
ANDY: Erin. 
ANDY: Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That s something you can t take back. 
ANDY: Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know?  Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football...  Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry.  I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though. 
ANDY: Even the fact that I'm gay? 
ANDY: Even without an audience you re still at it. 
ANDY: Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog? 
ANDY: Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding. 
ANDY: Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense. David 
ANDY: Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over. Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day. It's weird. 
ANDY: Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do? 
ANDY: Everybody out. 
ANDY: Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here. 
ANDY: Everyone please, just- 
ANDY: Everyone! Changed my mind again. 
ANDY: Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever. 
ANDY: Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices. 
ANDY: Everyone. 
ANDY: Evil!  although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants. 
ANDY: Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life.  I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one. Party 
ANDY: Exactly. 
ANDY: Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today. 
ANDY: Exactly. Help me po  mouth, Darryl. 
ANDY: Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys?  I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars. 
ANDY: Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why  Toby is giving us self defense training. 
ANDY: Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere. 
ANDY: Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer. 
ANDY: Except for one flower, which is for... my flower. 
ANDY: Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling.  Suite 401. 
ANDY: Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please? 
ANDY: Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now. 
ANDY: Excuse me, dirty birdie  
ANDY: Excuse me. 
ANDY: Excuse me. 
ANDY: Excuse me? 
ANDY: Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights. 
ANDY: Express love, magical. 
ANDY: Fail. 
ANDY: Fart .. good Sesh.  That leg s asleep. 
ANDY: Fascinating. 
ANDY: Feel it against your cheek. 
ANDY: Feel ya, dawg. 
ANDY: Few other super simple reminders   no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl? 
ANDY: Fifty-two reams! 
ANDY: Fine! 
ANDY: Fine!  Please make sure no one is humping me! 
ANDY: Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes. Broccoli 
ANDY: Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy? 
ANDY: Fine. 
ANDY: Fine. But I could have. 
ANDY: Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater? 
ANDY: Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin.  Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service? 
ANDY: Fine. I will give you one minute. 
ANDY: Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.  Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD.  That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good? 
ANDY: Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading. 
ANDY: Fire guy  
ANDY: First item on the 
ANDY: Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river. 
ANDY: Five to six hours? 
ANDY: Focus on the horizon.  Whoa! Look at this guy. 
ANDY: Football cream. Grr! 
ANDY: For four more days. 
ANDY: For happy hour? 
ANDY: For Madame et monsieur.   
ANDY: For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here...  
ANDY: For two hours? Really? 
ANDY: For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women. 
ANDY: Four! Three! Two! One! 
ANDY: Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese. 
ANDY: From 'Cheers'. 
ANDY: From total loss to total boss, I mean- 
ANDY: Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required. 
ANDY: Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes. 
ANDY: Gabe, I told you all about the printers. 
ANDY: Gahhh. That's five strikes. 
ANDY: G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me? 
ANDY: Geez, a little bit.  How you doing old buddy? Missed you. 
ANDY: Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone. 
ANDY: Gentleman.   
ANDY: Get back to normalcy. 
ANDY: Get excited! 
ANDY: Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach. 
ANDY: Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim.   
ANDY: Get in here.  Where did you learn to talk like that? 
ANDY: Get out of the way! 
ANDY: Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo! 
ANDY: Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce? 
ANDY: Give me something! 
ANDY: Give me that  
ANDY: Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this! 
ANDY: Go away, we're running lines. 
ANDY: Go do the voodoo that you do so well. 
ANDY: Go Einsteins! 
ANDY: Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous. 
ANDY: Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously! 
ANDY: Go, go, go, go! 
ANDY: Go, go, go, go, go!!   
ANDY: Goat  
ANDY: God, Toby, don t stop blocking my hand. 
ANDY: Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this... 
ANDY: Golf. 
ANDY: Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my "Lost" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out? 
ANDY: Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life. 
ANDY: Good morning, Pam. 
ANDY: Good morning. 
ANDY: Good one. Okay, you ready? 
ANDY: Good stuff. Nice stuff.   Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah. 
ANDY: Good! 
ANDY: Good, good. What else? 
ANDY: Good. Drew. 
ANDY: Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about. 
ANDY: Good. Keepin' 'em honest. 
ANDY: Good-bye, Lackawana County. 
ANDY: Gosh, I hope so. 
ANDY: Got it.  
ANDY: Got it. Dually noted. You!  Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that? 
ANDY: Got it. Then I will call you. 
ANDY: Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers. 
ANDY: Gotcha something.  And, uh, I just really want to talk to you- 
ANDY: Gotta get my goin' out on. 
ANDY: Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now. 
ANDY: Great game, coach. 
ANDY: Great group! Pizza party! 
ANDY: Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL. 
ANDY: Great! 
ANDY: Great!  
ANDY: Great! David 
ANDY: Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you. 
ANDY: Great. 
ANDY: Great. And Kevin. 
ANDY: Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela? 
ANDY: Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum! 
ANDY: Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse. 
ANDY: Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place. 
ANDY: Guess what? Not happening at work. 
ANDY: Guys! Guys! Guys! 
ANDY: Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing.  Banjo at 0:19 is aight  Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy. I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler? 
ANDY: guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser. 
ANDY: Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just... 
ANDY: Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet.  
ANDY: Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking. 
ANDY: Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born. 
ANDY: Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys! 
ANDY: Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds. 
ANDY: Guys.. 
ANDY: Guys? 
ANDY: Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts? 
ANDY: Ha ha ha. That's funny.   Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy. 
ANDY: Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be . Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was  Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes  by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith African American Mambazo. 
ANDY: Ha! Knew it! 
ANDY: Ha! Tuna...  Tuna Tuna Tuna.

ANDY: Haha, what? 
ANDY: Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea! 
ANDY: Hail to the chief! 
ANDY: Hand me that water. I always say "Beer me." Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name? 
ANDY: Hang on. 
ANDY: Have a good meeting! 
ANDY: Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out. 
ANDY: Have we heard of it? 
ANDY: Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes? 
ANDY: Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here? 
ANDY: He beat the computer. 
ANDY: He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it? 
ANDY: He does your laundry? 
ANDY: He drives an SUV! 
ANDY: He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes. 
ANDY: He ll know that we looked at his private notebook. 
ANDY: He sure did. 
ANDY: Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow. Carla Fern got me a gig. 
ANDY: Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories? HCT Member 
ANDY: Hello Kitty's for girls. 
ANDY: Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy? 
ANDY: Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call.

ANDY: Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call...  
ANDY: Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice. 
ANDY: Here, right there.  Down the hatch. 
ANDY: Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we re talking about is basically the speech equivalent  to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use but need need for talk talk. 
ANDY: Here... 
ANDY: Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time. Good luck with your impossible dream. 
ANDY: Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences? 
ANDY: He's alive. So you're welcome. 
ANDY: He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever. 
ANDY: He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman. 
ANDY: Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat.  
ANDY: Hey boss. Got a minute? 
ANDY: Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to "play ball." Those were his words.

ANDY: Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack! 
ANDY: Hey! Where did you go?

ANDY: Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick. 
ANDY: Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning. 
ANDY: Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants? 
ANDY: Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great. 
ANDY: Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink. 
ANDY: Hey, we'll be just fine. 
ANDY: Hey, what s goin  on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young uns? 
ANDY: Hey, what's the haps?  
ANDY: Hey, yes. 
ANDY: Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back. 
ANDY: Hey. 
ANDY: Hey. 
ANDY: Hey. 
ANDY: Hey. 
ANDY: Hey.  We're back. 
ANDY: Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself. 
ANDY: Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed.  
ANDY: Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch.  C'mon, my treat. 
ANDY: Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed.  
ANDY: Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman. 
ANDY: Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding 
ANDY: Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in.

ANDY: Hi! 
ANDY: Hi, how's it going? 
ANDY: Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let s say top-tier and others would be second-tier. 
ANDY: Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right? 
ANDY: Hi. 
ANDY: Hi. 
ANDY: Hi. 
ANDY: Hi. 
ANDY: Hi. Darryl:It s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died. 
ANDY: Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back.  Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on? 
ANDY: Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material. 
ANDY: Higher? Okay.  Recently certain events have come to my attention... 
ANDY: His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse. 
ANDY: Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender.  It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful. 
ANDY: Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview. 
ANDY: Hm? 
ANDY: Hmm. 
ANDY: Hmm. 
ANDY: Hmm. 
ANDY: Hmm.  
ANDY: Hmm. Very true. 
ANDY: Hmm... mm, what's that smell? 
ANDY: Hmm? 
ANDY: Hmm? 
ANDY: Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener.  
ANDY: Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440. 
ANDY: Hmm? Who? Sam? 
ANDY: Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott. 
ANDY: Hobos live in trains. 
ANDY: Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing! 
ANDY: Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you. 
ANDY: Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for. 
ANDY: Hoo hoo hoo-hoo! 
ANDY: Hope you brought your appetitos. My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn.   Uh, damn it. This movie, a lot of buzz. Not coming out for another six months. Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges. 
ANDY: Hour forty-five. 
ANDY: How about a little bit of this. 
ANDY: How are my sales doin'? Busted. My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy. You're not buying it, you're good. Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately. I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer. 
ANDY: How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day. 
ANDY: How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke  of good fortune and he is now in a better place. 
ANDY: How could I not see it? You're so right. 
ANDY: How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It s cause I had a fallback. That s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself. 
ANDY: How did Meredith get put at the young people's table? 
ANDY: How do you not have a toothbrush? 
ANDY: How does he feel about it? 
ANDY: How does that work? 
ANDY: How is that relevant to anything? 
ANDY: How long has it been going on? 
ANDY: How many dates have you been on? 
ANDY: How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home. 
ANDY: How next to? 
ANDY: How romantic is this? 
ANDY: How? 
ANDY: How'd it look? 
ANDY: How's it going over here, guys? 
ANDY: Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now. 
ANDY: Huh! 
ANDY: Huh, yeah.  I mean, I m happy Angela s the first one getting famous, but it s a little weird, no? I mean, she can t sing or act, so it s actually kind of insane, if you think about it. 
ANDY: Huh.  
ANDY: Huh... We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends. 
ANDY: Huh? 
ANDY: Huh? Yeah, see ya.  Oh! What?!  Promo 
ANDY: Hundred and twenty points. 
ANDY: Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride. 
ANDY: I accidentally ate some seahorses. 
ANDY: I actually had that down in the cons column, but... 
ANDY: I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say? 
ANDY: I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else 
ANDY: I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle. 
ANDY: I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance! 
ANDY: I am about to die.   Will you wait here while I go get my jacket? 
ANDY: I am calm. 
ANDY: I am gay, and I prefer men. 
ANDY: I am going in there! Don t  Check-in 
ANDY: I am lying. I am a compulsive liar. 
ANDY: I am not asking, I am ordering. 
ANDY: I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad. 
ANDY: I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in! 
ANDY: I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard!  
ANDY: I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic. 
ANDY: I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win. 
ANDY: I am so great! 
ANDY: I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog had to pull rank. 
ANDY: I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here. 
ANDY: I am the captain. 
ANDY: I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges. 
ANDY: I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds?  
ANDY: I believe in that. 
ANDY: I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city. 
ANDY: I bought these. 
ANDY: I call foul, sir. 
ANDY: I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring. 
ANDY: I can do a better one. 
ANDY: I can do the evolution of dance-dance. 
ANDY: I can make myself cry. 
ANDY: I can t. 
ANDY: I cannot believe you're still up! 
ANDY: I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all? 
ANDY: I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive. 
ANDY: I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at. 
ANDY: I can't hear you through the glass 
ANDY: I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do. 
ANDY: I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball. I've never even used an eye dropper. Production 
ANDY: I can't tell if he's mocking me. 
ANDY: I changed my mind.  
ANDY: I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper. 
ANDY: I did stand up comedy once. 
ANDY: I did, I felt it. 
ANDY: I didn t do anything any of you wouldn t have done. 
ANDY: I didn't even say what it is. 
ANDY: I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know. 
ANDY: I didn't know you had a brother. 
ANDY: I didn't know you were going to be here. Walter 
ANDY: I didn't see that movie. 
ANDY: I didn't tell you. 
ANDY: I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words. 
ANDY: I didn't. I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat. But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda. 
ANDY: I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup. 
ANDY: I do. 
ANDY: I do. 
ANDY: I don t care.  
ANDY: I don t know where it came from. 
ANDY: I don t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming,  Red Alert.  
ANDY: I don t think she s dead. 
ANDY: I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you. 
ANDY: I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys? 
ANDY: I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse. 
ANDY: I don't care, that's how much I swear! 
ANDY: I don't care. 
ANDY: I don't do drugs! 
ANDY: I don't even know what that card said. 
ANDY: I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice? 
ANDY: I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself. 
ANDY: I don't know how you got there. 
ANDY: I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things. 
ANDY: I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me. 
ANDY: I don't know yet, I have to call you back. Voice #1 on 
ANDY: I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me. 
ANDY: I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith. 
ANDY: I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or... 
ANDY: I don't know. 
ANDY: I don't know.  
ANDY: I don't know.  Just let it vibrate. It's fine. 
ANDY: I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties. 
ANDY: I don't mean to go into a rant here, but... 
ANDY: I don't normally do this, but... Girl at 
ANDY: I don't think it does that. 
ANDY: I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing. 
ANDY: I don't want to have said that. But I think it's important that you know it. 
ANDY: I don't want to talk about work right now. 
ANDY: I don't-just people. For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic. 
ANDY: I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna.  Andy and the tuna... 
ANDY: I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics. 
ANDY: I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before. 
ANDY: I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning? 
ANDY: I forgot, a  a pan, uh   
ANDY: I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms. 
ANDY: I found my calling. 
ANDY: I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him.   I got him! 
ANDY: I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me. 
ANDY: I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up. 
ANDY: I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife. 
ANDY: I get to kiss her forehead.   I had a good time hanging out this weekend. 
ANDY: I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago. 
ANDY: I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it. 
ANDY: I got it, try, um-- 
ANDY: I got mine. They were really good. 
ANDY: I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion  
ANDY: I gotcha covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself.  Got some extra balls!  Hey-hey-hey-ho! 
ANDY: I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me? 
ANDY: I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated. 
ANDY: I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam. 
ANDY: I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back. Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  So look out Dunder Mifflin!   I mean, look out... in a fun way! You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you... 
ANDY: I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived. 
ANDY: I guess it's starting. Um, yeah. Of course. Yeah sure. Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it- 
ANDY: I guess this is my life now. 
ANDY: I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview. 
ANDY: I had a salmon salad. With water, no ice. I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it. Her name was Flo, she had black hair. 
ANDY: I had no idea. 
ANDY: I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me. And he's delightful!   David 
ANDY: I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life! 
ANDY: I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner. 
ANDY: I have a delicious secret. 
ANDY: I have everything I need-   
ANDY: I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times. 
ANDY: I have needs. 
ANDY: I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe. 
ANDY: I have some good ideas... 
ANDY: I have to pick one of those? 
ANDY: I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right? 
ANDY: I heard it from Erin. 
ANDY: I hope I get to work with you someday again. 
ANDY: I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy. 
ANDY: I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man. 
ANDY: I insist. 
ANDY: I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working!  I feel exactly like a seahorse!  Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub. 
ANDY: I just gonna- quick-  Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay.  Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back! 
ANDY: I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - "Boo!" Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - "Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high." Scared the s**t out of me. 
ANDY: I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There s a review of the documentary! 
ANDY: I just gotta do one thing.  
ANDY: I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em! 
ANDY: I just need you to know- 
ANDY: I just stepped in to talk some sense into them. 
ANDY: I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie. 
ANDY: I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all. Anybody? 
ANDY: I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior. 
ANDY: I just want one mother delicious moment. Is that too much to ask? 
ANDY: I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence. 
ANDY: I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine. 
ANDY: I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more?  What do you think, C-SPAN? 
ANDY: I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?   What's that? 
ANDY: I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs. 
ANDY: I knew it! 
ANDY: I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch! Broccoli 
ANDY: I know a few things about love. Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things. 
ANDY: I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite. 
ANDY: I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red. 
ANDY: I know it's like cricket. 
ANDY: I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list. 
ANDY: I know that it s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname "Boner Champ," that is when I became me. 
ANDY: I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye.  
ANDY: I know who did this....Dwight. 
ANDY: I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home.  I know who I want to take me home.  Take me hooo hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing  no traditions! 
ANDY: I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again. 
ANDY: I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen. 
ANDY: I know, I know that you're proud of me. 
ANDY: I know, right? 
ANDY: I know, right? 
ANDY: I know, right? 
ANDY: I know, right? 
ANDY: I know. 
ANDY: I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game. 
ANDY: I left my cell phone in my car. 
ANDY: I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws. 
ANDY: I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay. 
ANDY: I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith. 
ANDY: I ll explore exploring it. 
ANDY: I ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home.  
ANDY: I ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong.  Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard! 
ANDY: I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar. 
ANDY: I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name. 
ANDY: I love to dance- 
ANDY: I m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go? 
ANDY: I m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs. Mr. 
ANDY: I m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time. 
ANDY: I m delivering it from the fridge. It s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza? 
ANDY: I m going in there. 
ANDY: I m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person. 
ANDY: I m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream. David 
ANDY: I m not going to take it. And then he s going to be like  whoa this is a really important meeting . 
ANDY: I m sorry   I m with a very important client. It ll have to wait. 
ANDY: I m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.  Just sit here and cry, just sit here and cry! Oh I can so just sit here and cry. You guys are really mean. It can t end like this you know. Slept in my car last night, quit my job. Burned all my bridges. And I did unspeakable things   You re just not good, you re just not good.   Are you insane?   You re just not good, you re just not good.   Chill out!  Just sit here and cry  
ANDY: I m sorry, what? HCT Member 
ANDY: I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn t help. 
ANDY: I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person. 
ANDY: I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single. 
ANDY: I mean, it's distant, but... 
ANDY: I mean, it's pretty broken already. 
ANDY: I mean, like, "156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left." 
ANDY: I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but... 
ANDY: I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything. 
ANDY: I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun. 
ANDY: I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time? 
ANDY: I mean...  
ANDY: I mean... I'm impressed. 
ANDY: I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire. 
ANDY: I miss her too. 
ANDY: I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one. 
ANDY: I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base? 
ANDY: I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business. 
ANDY: I need to talk to you in private. 
ANDY: I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip. 
ANDY: I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous. 
ANDY: I play the banjo. 
ANDY: I promise you that I will. 
ANDY: I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today. 
ANDY: I really 'Schruted' it. 
ANDY: I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind. 
ANDY: I resent that. I, I never lied to you. 
ANDY: I said are you ready TO PARTY! 
ANDY: I said I can do a better one. Darryl... 
ANDY: I said no hits! 
ANDY: I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle. She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that. And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her. 
ANDY: I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you. 
ANDY: I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb. 
ANDY: I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her? 
ANDY: I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup. 
ANDY: I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you re in the good old days before you ve actually left them.  Someone should write a song about that. 
ANDY: I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf. 
ANDY: I started to ask myself, "Do I have big plans here?" I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group? Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School. 
ANDY: I stole it! 
ANDY: I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen. 
ANDY: I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet. 
ANDY: I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree. 
ANDY: I swear... 
ANDY: I think he can hear us. 
ANDY: I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor .vanilla? 
ANDY: I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here.  Whizzzzz.  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh! 
ANDY: I think I should go the hospital. 
ANDY: I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure.  
ANDY: I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important. 
ANDY: I think we should. 
ANDY: I think we ve seen enough. You can turn it off now.  Yeah turn it off now. 
ANDY: I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes.  
ANDY: I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know? 
ANDY: I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well. David 
ANDY: I think you're going to like it. 
ANDY: I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality. 
ANDY: I thought you were at your sister's funeral. 
ANDY: I thought you were in rehab. Walt 
ANDY: I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital. 
ANDY: I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her. 
ANDY: I use the word  guys  a lot when I'm nervous...guys. 
ANDY: I ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee.  Mmm . 
ANDY: I ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear. 
ANDY: I wanna take you to sex school. 
ANDY: I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words--- 
ANDY: I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house.  C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day. 
ANDY: I want you to print that out for me. 
ANDY: I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin. 
ANDY: I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It s going to be terrible. 
ANDY: I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket. 
ANDY: I was going to tell her, just on my own time. 
ANDY: I was gonna say he was a tax evader. 
ANDY: I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour? 
ANDY: I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup. 
ANDY: I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica. 
ANDY: I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you re Boner Champ. Broccoli 
ANDY: I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you.  
ANDY: I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would. 
ANDY: I was telling that... I was telling that. 
ANDY: I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh. 
ANDY: I was too embarrassed!  
ANDY: I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so-- 
ANDY: I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying. 
ANDY: I was... 
ANDY: I wasn t fired. What are you talking about? I m fired up, yes. Guys, I m I m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous. 
ANDY: I wasn't acc-, accusing... 
ANDY: I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted. 
ANDY: I wasn't telling you. 
ANDY: I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot. 
ANDY: I will fight you. 
ANDY: I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis. 
ANDY: I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick. 
ANDY: I will try. 
ANDY: I will! I will take all of those dogs! 
ANDY: I wish you well on your quest. 
ANDY: I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something? 
ANDY: I would agree with that. 
ANDY: I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend. 
ANDY: I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor. 
ANDY: I would like that. 
ANDY: I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We re 100 percent staffed up. 
ANDY: I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish. 
ANDY: I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny. 
ANDY: I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional. 
ANDY: I, I didn't know. I didn't do that! 
ANDY: I, I thought that you would like it. 
ANDY: I... don't know. Help me. 
ANDY: I... Got... It. 
ANDY: I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up. 
ANDY: I'd like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry in the warehouse who passed away this year.  Well, that's all folks.  Ski ya later everybody. Thanks for a great season.  
ANDY: If- 
ANDY: If I am not Boner Champ, I don t know who I am. 
ANDY: If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance. 
ANDY: If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her. 
ANDY: If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come. 
ANDY: If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm. 
ANDY: If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well? 
ANDY: If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer. 
ANDY: If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom. 
ANDY: If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models. 
ANDY: If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how s the sales doubling  project going? 
ANDY: If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you. 
ANDY: If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night. 
ANDY: If the shoe fits.  
ANDY: If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper. 
ANDY: If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway. 
ANDY: If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather. 
ANDY: If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets. 
ANDY: If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell. 
ANDY: I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs. 
ANDY: I'll call you back. 
ANDY: I'll check the web. 
ANDY: I'll drop an ethics bomb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom! 
ANDY: I'll go with you Stanley. 
ANDY: I'll use my hands on it. 
ANDY: I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin. Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone. And she might be a murderer. 
ANDY: I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks.  Oh, there's the phone! 
ANDY: I'm acting my heart out here. 
ANDY: I'm Andy. 
ANDY: I'm doing this for you Meredith! 
ANDY: I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked. 
ANDY: I'm glad you asked   Connecticut Casual. 
ANDY: I'm going in, into the belly of the beast. Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  What's up, mancave!  
ANDY: I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up. 
ANDY: I'm going to Florida to get Erin.  Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so-  'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer! 
ANDY: I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years. 
ANDY: I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car. 
ANDY: I'm gonna lose 'em. 
ANDY: I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me. Like a kind old uncle Remus. I wanna stay in touch. 
ANDY: I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash. 
ANDY: I'm her fiance. 
ANDY: I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right?  Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP. 
ANDY: I'm in it to win. 
ANDY: I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. 
ANDY: I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone. 
ANDY: I'm like a quarter of the way through. 
ANDY: I'm not asking for one, I need it. 
ANDY: I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I- 
ANDY: I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back. 
ANDY: I'm not crying I'm just sweating. 
ANDY: I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling. 
ANDY: I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that. 
ANDY: I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your . 
ANDY: I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen. 
ANDY: I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright! 
ANDY: I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know.  Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um.  Pretty normal night. 
ANDY: I'm pretty good at board games. 
ANDY: I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something. 
ANDY: I'm punishing them. 
ANDY: I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last... 
ANDY: I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight. 
ANDY: I'm saying no. 
ANDY: I'm so jealous right now. 
ANDY: I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, "this sounds really stupid." 
ANDY: I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already. 
ANDY: I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time. 
ANDY: I'm sorry, I meant later. 
ANDY: I'm sorry, I thought you saw me. 
ANDY: I'm sorry, nine days until what? 
ANDY: I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards. 
ANDY: I'm still the boss! 
ANDY: I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home. 
ANDY: I'm taking it over from here. 
ANDY: I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply! 
ANDY: I'm telling you to back down. 
ANDY: I'm the captain.  Hey, charm school. Boat 
ANDY: I'm thinking about it-- 
ANDY: I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today. 
ANDY: I'm willing to pay you. 
ANDY: I'm your wingman. 
ANDY: I'm... I'm asking you out. 
ANDY: In a minute. In a minute. 
ANDY: In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce. 
ANDY: In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey? 
ANDY: In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so... 
ANDY: In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and...  we'll see what Rosa comes back with. 
ANDY: In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down. 
ANDY: In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop. 
ANDY: In this climate? 
ANDY: In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me. 
ANDY: Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence. 
ANDY: Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls. 
ANDY: Into the mic, sweetie. 
ANDY: Invest in softer cotton, sir.  OW! Oh! Oooh!  oh, whoa!! 
ANDY: Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin! 
ANDY: Is everyone licensed? Male Applicant 
ANDY: Is it criminal? 
ANDY: Is it serious?  Wow. Andy's a wittle scared. 
ANDY: Is it true? 
ANDY: Is it true? 
ANDY: Is somebody there? 
ANDY: Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica? 
ANDY: Is that right? 
ANDY: Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing? 
ANDY: Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill? 
ANDY: Is this Robert s attempt to embarrass me? 
ANDY: Isn't that part of the fun? 
ANDY: Isn't that your money? 
ANDY: It could totally work though. I don t know why we wouldn t. Oh my god are we doing this? 
ANDY: It doesn t include headshots. 
ANDY: It doesn't matter. 
ANDY: It has my face on it. 
ANDY: It is 1-3-4, Kev!   
ANDY: It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party. 
ANDY: It is not just coffee. 
ANDY: It is? I'm sorry. 
ANDY: It-- it's warm. 
ANDY: It just was one of those things- 
ANDY: It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing. 
ANDY: It really looks great. You did a great job. 
ANDY: It s a photocopy from your notebook. 
ANDY: It s just business. 
ANDY: It s now or never. 
ANDY: It s okay.  The hell does he know? 
ANDY: It s only 6:00. Come on, everybody s going. 
ANDY: It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything.  Not anything. 
ANDY: It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down. 
ANDY: It sure seems like he is lying. 
ANDY: It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person! 
ANDY: It was before, my tech- my technical training. 
ANDY: It was hilarious. 
ANDY: It was like a security blan- 
ANDY: It was like amateur hour. 
ANDY: It was my scrotum. Um, and it was. Thank you. 
ANDY: It was? 
ANDY: It wasn't either of you. 
ANDY: It will be her name. And you will have to call her that! 
ANDY: It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable. 
ANDY: It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind. 
ANDY: It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight. 
ANDY: It, it's, it's actually just an issue... 
ANDY: It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis? 
ANDY: Its  I mean come on. 
ANDY: It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta  move on . Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm.  
ANDY: It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too. 
ANDY: It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched. 
ANDY: It's got pheromones in it. 
ANDY: It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage. 
ANDY: It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater. 
ANDY: It's John Gotti, you idiot! 
ANDY: It's junk! 
ANDY: It's just a garden party. Sheesh. 
ANDY: It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it. 
ANDY: It's just, I really need a real accountant on this.  What do you say? 
ANDY: It's like a haunted disco. 
ANDY: It's like a little envelope-- there you go. 
ANDY: It's like a ten minute walk. 
ANDY: It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall. 
ANDY: It's literally like- 
ANDY: It's me!  I am related to Michelle Obama. 
ANDY: It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time. 
ANDY: It's my ear. 
ANDY: It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else. 
ANDY: It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's. 
ANDY: It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario. 
ANDY: It's not that, exactly. 
ANDY: It's not... Whether or not, you... 
ANDY: It's on! 
ANDY: It's over. 
ANDY: It's pronounced "Corn-ell!" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League! 
ANDY: It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. . Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago. And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin. 
ANDY: It's so good to meet you! 
ANDY: It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin...  I thought that would be cooler. 
ANDY: It's the new guy.  
ANDY: It's the world's only international sport!  
ANDY: It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster. 
ANDY: It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy . Not! You just got 'Nard dogged! 
ANDY: It's, I mean. 
ANDY: I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose . 
ANDY: I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right. 
ANDY: I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously. 
ANDY: I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol  family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States. 
ANDY: I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it. 
ANDY: I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it. 
ANDY: I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance.  
ANDY: Jackpot. 
ANDY: Jamie! 
ANDY: Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but... 
ANDY: Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee. 
ANDY: Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom. 
ANDY: Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head. 
ANDY: Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office? 
ANDY: Jim! How 'bout you? 
ANDY: Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine. 
ANDY: Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something. 
ANDY: Jim, it s fine. He ll just get you on his cell phone and then that ll go viral. 
ANDY: Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness. 
ANDY: Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right? 
ANDY: Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it. 
ANDY: Jim. 
ANDY: Jim? 
ANDY: Jim? 
ANDY: Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea! 
ANDY: J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money. 
ANDY: Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like," I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me." And the shop girl goes, "ok". And Julia Roberts goes," You girls work on commission, right?" And the girl is like,"Yeah", and Julia Roberts goes... 
ANDY: Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals... 
ANDY: Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight? 
ANDY: Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam. 
ANDY: Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute "break a legs" or "I still love you" type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything. Maybe on my Facebook wall. 
ANDY: Just close it. 
ANDY: Just do it. 
ANDY: Just don t do the song anymore. Broccoli 
ANDY: Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up. 
ANDY: Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own. 
ANDY: Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job. 
ANDY: Just make him stop the freaking bus! 
ANDY: Just make up a phone call. It s not a real call. Make it up. 
ANDY: Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women s soccer, no? 
ANDY: Just need a second outside. 
ANDY: Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people. 
ANDY: Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box. 
ANDY: Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car? David 
ANDY: Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's. It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time. 
ANDY: Just, please... 
ANDY: Just, you sure Clark? 
ANDY: K 
ANDY: Kaaw! 
ANDY: Kay. 
ANDY: Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before? 
ANDY: Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found. 
ANDY: -ket 
ANDY: Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow. 
ANDY: Kevin has that lovability. 
ANDY: Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt. 
ANDY: Kevin, I appreciate what you re trying to do. 
ANDY: Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy. 
ANDY: Kevin, you open it up. 
ANDY: Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. 
ANDY: Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble! 
ANDY: Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement. 
ANDY: Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton.  
ANDY: Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device? 
ANDY: Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me. 
ANDY: Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat. 
ANDY: Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know.  Na, nothing really. Kevin? 
ANDY: Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt. And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two. 
ANDY: Last year, I went to a seminar called "The Ten Secrets of Real Estate". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients. 
ANDY: Later man. 
ANDY: Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight.   It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge. 
ANDY: Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about- 
ANDY: Let me get a picture of you guys. 
ANDY: Let me know what they say. 
ANDY: Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night. 
ANDY: Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale. 
ANDY: Let me think about it-- 
ANDY: Let me think about it-- 
ANDY: Let s ink my stink!  
ANDY: Let us know if you need anything. 
ANDY: Let's do it. 
ANDY: Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, "Don't Just Dream it, do it." Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone.  
ANDY: Let's go before I vomit.  
ANDY: Let's go to the conference room. 
ANDY: Let's go, let's go. 
ANDY: Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast? 
ANDY: Let's just jump in the air! 
ANDY: Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that. 
ANDY: Let's not go crazy. 
ANDY: Let's see how well you know your Big Red history. 
ANDY: Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought. 
ANDY: Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan? 
ANDY: Light side. 
ANDY: Like a month ago. 
ANDY: Like your toothbrush and stuff. 
ANDY: Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should. 
ANDY: Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot. 
ANDY: Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song. 
ANDY: Little raw. Not cool Oscar. 
ANDY: Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you. 
ANDY: Look up here! 
ANDY: Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so- 
ANDY: Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis? 
ANDY: Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I... 
ANDY: Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants... 
ANDY: Look, it's not that I don't want- 
ANDY: Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all. 
ANDY: Lot going on guys. What s happening? 
ANDY: Loud and clear.  
ANDY: Love the belt. 
ANDY: Love you too. Businessman 
ANDY: Mail call!  His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt. 
ANDY: Make a donation. 
ANDY: Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park. 
ANDY: Make it higher? Okay. 
ANDY: May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you.  
ANDY: Maybe it's just more like, "be mine." 
ANDY: Maybe like a year ago... 
ANDY: Maybe we could switch instruments. 
ANDY: Maybe we have a plan for you? 
ANDY: Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe  you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember. 
ANDY: Maybe you're in the ceiling! 
ANDY: Maybe. Only maybe. 
ANDY: Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale. 
ANDY: Me likey! 
ANDY: Me too. Hold my place in line. 
ANDY: Me, I guess.  We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I! 
ANDY: Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body. 
ANDY: Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid. 
ANDY: Megan Fox! Come on! 
ANDY: Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word  no  not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with. 
ANDY: Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now. 
ANDY: Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys!  
ANDY: Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries. 
ANDY: Message received, little soy bean. 
ANDY: Michael 
ANDY: Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp! 
ANDY: Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike. 
ANDY: Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs? 
ANDY: Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II. 
ANDY: Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb. 
ANDY: Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike. 
ANDY: Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what? 
ANDY: Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport. 
ANDY: Michael, you're up. 
ANDY: Michael... am I gay? 
ANDY: Midnight what? 
ANDY: Might've done. And how  do you figure? 
ANDY: Mind if I close the door?  What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool. 
ANDY: Miss no more! What do you play? Join us! 
ANDY: Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins.   Comprehension skills, sub-par. 
ANDY: Mm, then I will make up a cause. 
ANDY: Mm, well, you used to be. 
ANDY: Mm. 
ANDY: Mm. 
ANDY: Mm. Mm-hmm.  
ANDY: Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official. 
ANDY: Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles. 
ANDY: Mm-hmm. 
ANDY: Mm-hmm. 
ANDY: Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy. 
ANDY: Mmhmmm. 
ANDY: Mmhmmm. 
ANDY: Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager. 
ANDY: Mmm, I doubt that very much. 
ANDY: Mmm. 
ANDY: Mmm... bingo!   Follow moi, bro-sieur. 
ANDY: Mmm-hmm. Erin? 
ANDY: Mmmhmmm... 
ANDY: Mmmm. Yeah you're right. 
ANDY: Mmmm.. suck-ah! 
ANDY: Mmmm... 
ANDY: Mm-wah!   
ANDY: Mobsters are! 
ANDY: Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person. 
ANDY: Monsieur. 
ANDY: Mooshie mooshie.  
ANDY: Mornin' Jim. 
ANDY: Morning, everyone. 
ANDY: Morning. 
ANDY: Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots. 
ANDY: Move it! 
ANDY: Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it. 
ANDY: Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her! Sweeney 
ANDY: Mushroom caps. 
ANDY: Must be a tough time to be a family farm. 
ANDY: My ass is only so big, I mean I can t do this everyday. 
ANDY: My bare hands. 
ANDY: My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book. 
ANDY: My Cornell a capella group. 
ANDY: My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it. 
ANDY: My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal s going out on. 
ANDY: My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama. 
ANDY: My first order of 
ANDY: My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.  
ANDY: My maid died. 
ANDY: My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage. 
ANDY: My name is Andy! 
ANDY: My nanny used to wear that. 
ANDY: My new girlfriend. 
ANDY: My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt. 
ANDY: My parents are broke. 
ANDY: My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other? 
ANDY: My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but... 
ANDY: My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could... 
ANDY: My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons. 
ANDY: My whole life is a booger bubble! 
ANDY: Nah, no. We'll be back before that. 
ANDY: Nah. I like my plan better. 
ANDY: Naked. 
ANDY: Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that? 
ANDY: Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother. 
ANDY: Neither am I, it s already done. Hah, I m just kidding, it s going to take some time. 
ANDY: Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge. 
ANDY: Never cry wolf. 
ANDY: New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father. 
ANDY: News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy. 
ANDY: News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later. 
ANDY: Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia! 
ANDY: Next. How about... . Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that. 
ANDY: Nice sweater. 
ANDY: Nice! 
ANDY: Nice. 
ANDY: Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet. 
ANDY: Nifty! 
ANDY: Night. 
ANDY: Night. 
ANDY: Nn no. 
ANDY: Nnnnya. 
ANDY: No !  
ANDY: No drama. Ok. 
ANDY: No games? 
ANDY: No I didn t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings. 
ANDY: No I didn t want her to call because I thought it would be weird. But now it s weird that she s not calling. 
ANDY: No I m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn t, I m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don t like to throw around the b-word, but I m going to be a huge bitch to you. 
ANDY: No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich. 
ANDY: No I'm just sweating. 
ANDY: No kidding? 
ANDY: No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry. 
ANDY: No no no no. 
ANDY: No one expects me to go through with this, right? 
ANDY: No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down. 
ANDY: No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired! 
ANDY: No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there. 
ANDY: No thanks. 
ANDY: No that's... not how it works. 
ANDY: No time to chat. 
ANDY: No way! 
ANDY: No way! Walt 
ANDY: No way!? 
ANDY: No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin. 
ANDY: No way, lady. 
ANDY: No what? 
ANDY: No where near the big rock. 
ANDY: No! 
ANDY: No! 
ANDY: No!  
ANDY: No!  
ANDY: NO! I want names! 
ANDY: No! No! No! 
ANDY: No, best thing that ever happened to me. 
ANDY: No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right. 
ANDY: No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane. 
ANDY: No, got canned last week. 
ANDY: No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook. 
ANDY: No, I- 
ANDY: No, I did not. Was that any good? 
ANDY: No, I do not. 
ANDY: No, I don t have AIDS. That s not what I said. Next question.  
ANDY: No, I insist. 
ANDY: No, I just applied for more overdraft protection. 
ANDY: No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that. 
ANDY: No, I'm good. 
ANDY: No, I'm just testing if he can hear. 
ANDY: No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it s not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it. 
ANDY: No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that? 
ANDY: No, it s me, Andy! 
ANDY: No, it's in New Mexico. 
ANDY: No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there. 
ANDY: No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Se or Loadenstein. 
ANDY: No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean. 
ANDY: No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, "Oh D, oh D." 
ANDY: No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you. 
ANDY: No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference.  This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference  thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends! 
ANDY: No, no, no, no, no, we don t need to call the police. They ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone s business, right, Pam? 
ANDY: No, no, no, no, no. 
ANDY: No, no, no. I m wearing makeup. 
ANDY: No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way. 
ANDY: No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated. 
ANDY: No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up? 
ANDY: No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N. 
ANDY: No, pause longer. 
ANDY: No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef. 
ANDY: No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad. 
ANDY: No, that s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about  
ANDY: No, that's ridiculous. 
ANDY: No, that's... 
ANDY: No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess. 
ANDY: No, this is horrifying. 
ANDY: No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores. 
ANDY: No, this is my time! You don t belt on my time! I belt on my time. 
ANDY: No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes. They re like two flaming meatballs in my skull. 
ANDY: No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. 
ANDY: No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word. 
ANDY: No. Because they all left. 
ANDY: No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too.  
ANDY: No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man... HCT Member 
ANDY: No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill. 
ANDY: No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage. 
ANDY: No. I don't. 
ANDY: No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you? 
ANDY: No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right? 
ANDY: No. I m a rogue. Mr. 
ANDY: No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women. 
ANDY: No. It s a job. Things are going great. 
ANDY: No. It's over between you two. 
ANDY: No. No that was real. 
ANDY: No. No! Nooo!  
ANDY: No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood. 
ANDY: No. No, no. 
ANDY: No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away. 
ANDY: No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time. 
ANDY: No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now. 
ANDY: No. Not that I see here. 
ANDY: No. That is a ridiculous waste of time. 
ANDY: No. That is not the deal. Calibrate. 
ANDY: No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it. 
ANDY: No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us. 
ANDY: No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind. Female 
ANDY: No. What? 
ANDY: No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy, 
ANDY: No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number? 
ANDY: No... I didn't steal your joke. 
ANDY: No...I don't, hmm, I don't know. 
ANDY: Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so... 
ANDY: Nobody wants ...that, to happen. 
ANDY: Nobody. Just say that I'm- Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I m going to refuse to take it. 
ANDY: Noishe! 
ANDY: 'Noishe.' 
ANDY: None of your business. 
ANDY: None, no part of this has anything to do with you. 
ANDY: Nonsense. Get up here. 
ANDY: Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right? 
ANDY: Nope!  
ANDY: Nope! Can t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern. Aaron 
ANDY: Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay...  You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance. 
ANDY: Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing. 
ANDY: Nope. 
ANDY: Nope. I have made up my mind. I m really sorry. David 
ANDY: Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger. 
ANDY: Not a joke. That was not even a joke. 
ANDY: Not a question. 
ANDY: Not at all. 
ANDY: Not cool. 
ANDY: Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves. 
ANDY: Not guy friends? 
ANDY: Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK? David 
ANDY: Not my slaves, my ancestors . Maybe. Probably not. 
ANDY: Not necessary. 
ANDY: Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom. 
ANDY: Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed! 
ANDY: Not this time. 
ANDY: Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com. 
ANDY: Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo! 
ANDY: Now check the style! 
ANDY: Now I know why Michael hated you so much. 
ANDY: Now open your eyes and describe it to me. 
ANDY: Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation s Lisa Loeb. 
ANDY: Now this is called slack lining. 
ANDY: Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m. 
ANDY: Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy. 
ANDY: Now? 
ANDY: Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine. 
ANDY: Number nine, number nine. Jim Halpert. 
ANDY: Obviously I'm going to clean up. 
ANDY: Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart.  But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting. 
ANDY: Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better. 
ANDY: OF course not. There s no magic button. You have to summon that. 
ANDY: Of course there are! 
ANDY: Of course they have. Which is why I m giving you a key to my house.  Whatever you need   anytime, night or day   you just stop on by. Mr. 
ANDY: Of course! 
ANDY: Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it. 
ANDY: Of course. 
ANDY: Of course. I own my toothbrush. 
ANDY: Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire. 
ANDY: Of Flatt & Scruggs! 
ANDY: Of the hourglass.. 
ANDY: Officer. 
ANDY: Oh boy.   
ANDY: Oh cause of last night? No way. Reports have been exaggerated. Weddings make me very emotional. I um--I just have that side to me. 
ANDY: Oh D! 
ANDY: Oh D. 
ANDY: Oh God! My nipples, it's starting. 
ANDY: Oh God. Come on! 
ANDY: Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? . The entire office is being nice to her than they ve ever been to me. What I wouldn t give for one of Phyllis  classic room clearing farts right now. 
ANDY: Oh I can so just sit here and cry! 
ANDY: Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton. 
ANDY: Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow!  
ANDY: Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible. 
ANDY: Oh Man!  
ANDY: Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours. 
ANDY: Oh man, she is so pissed.   
ANDY: Oh man. Talk about your classic "Lame dash O." Do we even want that guy buying our paper? 
ANDY: OH MY GOD! 
ANDY: Oh my God! 
ANDY: Oh my god. 
ANDY: Oh my god. 
ANDY: Oh my gosh, that would be amazing. 
ANDY: Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game? 
ANDY: Oh no! No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir. I am... totally and completely kidding!  Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95. Phil 
ANDY: Oh no. 
ANDY: Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or? 
ANDY: Oh thanks. 
ANDY: Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right.. 
ANDY: Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met.  
ANDY: Oh yeah. 
ANDY: Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow.  Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go. 
ANDY: Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying. 
ANDY: Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay,   you can look the other way. Loo do do! 
ANDY: Oh! 
ANDY: Oh! 
ANDY: Oh!  
ANDY: Oh! Ah, Megan. 
ANDY: Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So. 
ANDY: Oh! God!  
ANDY: Oh! Seven new comments.  The guy at 0:19 is hawt!    Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!   He's not hawt, he's gay.    Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.    He is hawt!  See, thank you, that's more like it.  He is butt.  God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh! 
ANDY: Oh! There we go! Pam? 
ANDY: Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses! 
ANDY: Oh, and I care why? 
ANDY: Oh, baloney. 
ANDY: Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class. 
ANDY: Oh, come on! 
ANDY: Oh, cool. 
ANDY: Oh, cool. 
ANDY: Oh, doggie. 
ANDY: Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you. 
ANDY: Oh, God! 
ANDY: Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax. 
ANDY: Oh, God. 
ANDY: Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company. 
ANDY: Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013.   Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.  Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED! 
ANDY: Oh, he's out there. 
ANDY: Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy! 
ANDY: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry! 
ANDY: Oh, I do! 
ANDY: Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack. 
ANDY: Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade. 
ANDY: Oh, I took out my lifts. 
ANDY: Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay. "Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha." 
ANDY: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty. 
ANDY: Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak.  Sweeney 
ANDY: Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn. 
ANDY: Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me. Boat 
ANDY: Oh, its on. 
ANDY: Oh, just backing up and turning around. 
ANDY: Oh, K. It's only three weeks. 
ANDY: Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble! 
ANDY: Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed. 
ANDY: Oh, look at this.  Tuna wrap. 
ANDY: Oh, man, that is, like, poetry. 
ANDY: Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye. 
ANDY: Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour? 
ANDY: Oh, my gosh. 
ANDY: Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too.  
ANDY: Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me. 
ANDY: Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so... 
ANDY: Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight s meeting. 
ANDY: Oh, no. 
ANDY: Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on.  Oh, there we go. 
ANDY: Oh, oh! 
ANDY: Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark? 
ANDY: Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so. 
ANDY: Oh, okay. I don t want any part of this. 
ANDY: Oh, okay... 
ANDY: Oh, or maybe not.  
ANDY: Oh, probably because of all the nose candy. 
ANDY: Oh, really? 
ANDY: Oh, really? From what, two to four? 
ANDY: Oh, really? I thought you were the boss. 
ANDY: Oh, Scranton Strangler!  
ANDY: Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks. Donna 
ANDY: Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came. 
ANDY: Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal!   
ANDY: Oh, thank you. 
ANDY: Oh, that burns! Golly. Um... 
ANDY: Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University. 
ANDY: Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I m thinking of. Can you clarify that? 
ANDY: Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah. 
ANDY: Oh, this is awkward.   
ANDY: Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body!  I had you, I had you! 
ANDY: Oh, we got this! 
ANDY: Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you. 
ANDY: Oh, whew! 
ANDY: Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night. 
ANDY: Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not. 
ANDY: Oh, yeah! 
ANDY: Oh, yeah, I was just tired. 
ANDY: Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow. 
ANDY: Oh. 
ANDY: Oh. 
ANDY: Oh. 
ANDY: Oh. 
ANDY: Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal. 
ANDY: Oh. Hmm. 
ANDY: Oh. Hmm. 
ANDY: Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession. 
ANDY: Oh. Okay. 
ANDY: Oh... 
ANDY: Oh...  
ANDY: Oh... at least we can kiss now. 
ANDY: Ohh... 
ANDY: Oh-oh, come on!

ANDY: OK what? 
ANDY: OK! 
ANDY: Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password. 
ANDY: OK, bye.  Alright Meredith, 
ANDY: Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous. 
ANDY: OK, fine, yeah. that s one guy s opinion! Broccoli 
ANDY: Ok, fine. Boat 
ANDY: OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out. 
ANDY: OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here. 
ANDY: Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker. But you know what? You're gonna love these guys. Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich. These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for. 
ANDY: OK, keep in mind, it s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions. My car  for a thousand points .or best offer. 
ANDY: OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to 
ANDY: Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I ll tell you how we can beat it. 
ANDY: Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa!  You suck. Alright, who s next? Darryl? 
ANDY: Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York. 
ANDY: Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk. 
ANDY: Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column. 
ANDY: Ok, well we'll see about that.  
ANDY: Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end? 
ANDY: OK. 
ANDY: Ok. 
ANDY: Ok. 
ANDY: Ok.  Andy & 
ANDY: OK.  I'll call you later. 
ANDY: Ok.  thanks. 
ANDY: OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there. 
ANDY: Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote  a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three.. 
ANDY: Ok. Erin I think you know I ve been dating someone. 
ANDY: OK. How do you feel about Maine?   I'm on it. I'll see you later, love.   
ANDY: OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio?  Just say the word 'coolio'. 
ANDY: OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND! 
ANDY: OK. Yeah. Look at my finger. Look. Looook! 
ANDY: OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something. 
ANDY: OK? 
ANDY: Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it? 
ANDY: Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital. 
ANDY: Okay! 
ANDY: Okay! Hope you all learned something! 
ANDY: Okay! That's so weird! Just go away! 
ANDY: Okay, all right, all right, all right. 
ANDY: Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood! 
ANDY: Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins! 
ANDY: Okay, guys! 
ANDY: Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear. 
ANDY: Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know- 
ANDY: Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project. Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles -- 
ANDY: Okay, I was just looking out for you.   You're doing great, by the way. 
ANDY: Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the... 
ANDY: Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot?   Okay. And all those opposed?   
ANDY: Okay, it sounds risky. 
ANDY: Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee. 
ANDY: Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night? 
ANDY: Okay, so I- 
ANDY: Okay, sorry. 
ANDY: Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome. 
ANDY: Okay, thanks. 
ANDY: Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four- 
ANDY: Okay, TMI. 
ANDY: Okay, Tuna. 
ANDY: Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady? 
ANDY: Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses. 
ANDY: Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now? Older 
ANDY: Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum "Suck It" to the U.S. military. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, "in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen."  
ANDY: Okay. Kelly and 
ANDY: Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows? 
ANDY: Okay. Let's do it. 
ANDY: Okay. Robert s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common? 
ANDY: Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza? 
ANDY: Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later. 
ANDY: Okay? I, I... didn't do it. 
ANDY: Okey dokey.  
ANDY: Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you? 
ANDY: Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot  
ANDY: On it! 
ANDY: On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania. 
ANDY: On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time. 
ANDY: One came up. 
ANDY: One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight? 
ANDY: One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer. 
ANDY: One more for the doc.  
ANDY: One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick! Keena 
ANDY: One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal. 
ANDY: One. Two. Three. Shot! 
ANDY: One. Two. Three. Shot! 
ANDY: Oof. What are you gonna do about that? 
ANDY: Ooh I didn t mean to offend you, and I hope you ll forgive me because I am very very  Sari.  Sixteen points. 
ANDY: Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail? 
ANDY: Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday. 
ANDY: Ooh, gosh! 
ANDY: Ooh, she's counting again. 
ANDY: Ooh, that sounds great. 
ANDY: Ooh. It's coming down out there. 
ANDY: Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp. 
ANDY: Oooh, maybe I can.  I got an email... from corporate....that told me that... 
ANDY: Oooh. 
ANDY: Oooohhh. 
ANDY: OooOK. 
ANDY: Oooooo, saucy. 
ANDY: Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! 
ANDY: Oop, got some blisties. Phil 
ANDY: Or both? 
ANDY: Oscar 
ANDY: Oscar says  hi  all the time. He says all kinds of greetings.  Hi   Hello   Hola  You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say  hi ? 
ANDY: Oscar, it's not that hot out. 
ANDY: Oui, Oui, Monsieur. From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar. Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan. Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious. At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing. If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese. Bon appetit. 
ANDY: Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That s what you did with this trip. 
ANDY: Out of my office, turns out you're fired... 
ANDY: Ow! Get off! Get off! 
ANDY: Ow. 
ANDY: Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant.  Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! 
ANDY: Pam! Come on! 
ANDY: Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in.  
ANDY: Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and- 
ANDY: Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us. 
ANDY: Pam. Can I talk to you in private? 
ANDY: Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around. Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay? 
ANDY: Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam. Doesn't matter what Pam looks like. 
ANDY: Parkour! 
ANDY: Partay. Room 639. 
ANDY: Pause after 'news'. 
ANDY: Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy. 
ANDY: People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my "knot" on. 
ANDY: People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon 
ANDY: Perfect. 
ANDY: Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia.  
ANDY: Pffft. 
ANDY: Ph. D. Doctor of Sales. 
ANDY: Phone's ringing. 
ANDY: Phyllis is out. Yes!  Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good.  
ANDY: Phyllis! 
ANDY: Phyllis, no body is handing anything out. 
ANDY: Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you. 
ANDY: Pi... 
ANDY: Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later. 
ANDY: Pizza rolls. 
ANDY: Play it cool, man. She'll come around. 
ANDY: Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you. 
ANDY: Please! 
ANDY: Pretty Woman. 
ANDY: Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton? 
ANDY: Pull the poop out of the toilets. 
ANDY: Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime. 
ANDY: Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here,  we need your help. 
ANDY: Put the game on hold everyone. 
ANDY: Question. Where's Jim? 
ANDY: Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work. 
ANDY: Really? 
ANDY: Really? 
ANDY: Really? 
ANDY: Really? 
ANDY: Really?   
ANDY: Really?   Huh, that's cool. 
ANDY: Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years .and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him. 
ANDY: Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday. 
ANDY: Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item? 
ANDY: Really? That doesn't sound right. 
ANDY: Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain. 
ANDY: Reception. Your classic one-man operation. 
ANDY: Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in. 
ANDY: Ree-De-De-De-Doo! Man 
ANDY: Rehash  
ANDY: Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them. 
ANDY: Reverse snobbery. 
ANDY: Ribbit! 
ANDY: Right on. 
ANDY: Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense? 
ANDY: Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone. 
ANDY: Right, it feels strange. 
ANDY: Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one. 
ANDY: Right. Do you see a clue or... 
ANDY: Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much. 
ANDY: Right. Okay. 
ANDY: Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room- 
ANDY: Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. Hey! There ya go...there he is. 
ANDY: Right? 
ANDY: Right? 
ANDY: Right? 
ANDY: Right? 
ANDY: Right? Rough scene. 
ANDY: Right-o. 
ANDY: Right-o. 
ANDY: Ring her up. 
ANDY: Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage. 
ANDY: Roller derby practice! 
ANDY: Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane. 
ANDY: Rude. And not helpful. 
ANDY: Ruh duh duh da dudes! What s up? 
ANDY: Russell, I m dressed like George Michael. HCT Member 
ANDY: Rut ti doh doh... 
ANDY: Rut ti doh doo doh 
ANDY: Rut tit doh doh... 
ANDY: Ryan, why didn't you tell me? 
ANDY: Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then 
ANDY: Saber.  Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Andy & 
ANDY: Saboteur! 
ANDY: Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. 
ANDY: Safe travels. 
ANDY: Same thing.  Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on. David 
ANDY: Saving the best for first! 
ANDY: Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon? 
ANDY: Say- 
ANDY: Say it. 
ANDY: Say what? 
ANDY: Say what? 
ANDY: Saying I love... Saying I love you... 
ANDY: 'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute? 
ANDY: Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway. 
ANDY: Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage. 
ANDY: See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It s Clark and, um  
ANDY: See what I mean? 
ANDY: See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time. 
ANDY: See you later. 
ANDY: See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here.   ...Darn! Heh. 
ANDY: Seems like... 
ANDY: Seems pretty well liked by the team. 
ANDY: Seriously, Angela? 
ANDY: Seriously? 
ANDY: Seriously? 
ANDY: Seriously? 
ANDY: Seriously?  Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you. 
ANDY: Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident.  But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies. 
ANDY: Sh--- 
ANDY: Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he. 
ANDY: Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh. 
ANDY: Sha-bow. 
ANDY: Shane. Great game man! 
ANDY: She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about? 
ANDY: She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate. 
ANDY: She probably a t-- 
ANDY: She s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls. 
ANDY: She said yes!  And the crowd goes wild! Woo!  
ANDY: She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right? 
ANDY: She works here too, how is that any different? 
ANDY: She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't. 
ANDY: She's babysitting? 
ANDY: She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen. 
ANDY: She's like, probably a tutor. 
ANDY: She's nature's bounty. 
ANDY: She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there. 
ANDY: She's pretty hot huh?  She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters. 
ANDY: She's taking us back to first base. 
ANDY: Shh! Shhh!  
ANDY: Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back. 
ANDY: Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away.  
ANDY: Shortcut! Shortcut!  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap! 
ANDY: Should I change? 
ANDY: Should I-I got it. I got it.  Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view. Bus 
ANDY: Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended. 
ANDY: Shut up, Broccoli. Broccoli 
ANDY: Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you. 
ANDY: Sixty bucks a session. 
ANDY: So bad! 
ANDY: So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to. 
ANDY: So Darryl says to me  fire me . But what he really means is  I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.  So I say  No, you're not fired.  But what I really mean is  I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better. ........I really hope that's what he and I mean. 
ANDY: So how do you want, how should I do it? 
ANDY: So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later? 
ANDY: So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself? 
ANDY: So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful. 
ANDY: So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth. 
ANDY: So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or? 
ANDY: So like, missionary... 
ANDY: So make that error! 
ANDY: So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material.  This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so. 
ANDY: So much more than words... 
ANDY: So no? 
ANDY: So pretty today. 
ANDY: So she looks at me right, and she goes, "I'm sorry, don't I even know you?" After a year, a year of buying lattes from her, do you believe that? 
ANDY: So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today."  Thank you. Michael  Head of the table. 
ANDY: So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no. 
ANDY: So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us.  Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today? 
ANDY: So we're just, like, jamming as friends? 
ANDY: So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines? 
ANDY: So you had a bad day... 
ANDY: So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles.  
ANDY: So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy. 
ANDY: So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested. 
ANDY: So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great. 
ANDY: So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia.  
ANDY: So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-? 
ANDY: So, it's a date. 
ANDY: So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today. 
ANDY: So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons. 
ANDY: So, Stanley, are you really outta here? 
ANDY: So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay? 
ANDY: So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place? 
ANDY: So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is. 
ANDY: So. 
ANDY: So... here's the thing about infidelity. 
ANDY: So... how was lunch? 
ANDY: So? 
ANDY: Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client.  I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all. 
ANDY: Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email. 
ANDY: Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage! 
ANDY: Some people are really popping on screen! 
ANDY: Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot  these. 
ANDY: Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by. 
ANDY: Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day. Oscar's voice from the 
ANDY: Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that. 
ANDY: Sookehhh.  Bill Compton, from True Blood. 
ANDY: Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut. 
ANDY: Sorry, that's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired. 
ANDY: Sorry, when did you get married? 
ANDY: --sorry, you go. 
ANDY: Sorry. 
ANDY: Sorry. 
ANDY: Sorry? Boat 
ANDY: Sounds controversial. 
ANDY: Spangler Springs is a mile this way. 
ANDY: Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend? 
ANDY: Specific shout-out.. 
ANDY: Spring sing  95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way. 
ANDY: Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees! 
ANDY: Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got? 
ANDY: Stanley, you're suppose to close. 
ANDY: Stanley. 
ANDY: Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the 
ANDY: Steven Sondheim. 
ANDY: Stock market. 
ANDY: Stop doing that! 
ANDY: Stop just saying that. 
ANDY: Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once!  Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you! 
ANDY: Stop saying my name. 
ANDY: Stop the bus! Michael and 
ANDY: Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, "Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance," and then you have to be like, "Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!" And then... we dance. Oh how we dance.  Sex also works. 
ANDY: Stupid dog. 
ANDY: Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me. 
ANDY: Such as? 
ANDY: Super romantic. 
ANDY: Sure thing, buddy. 
ANDY: Sure thing, Tuna Boss. 
ANDY: Sure,  Death of a Salesman  by Arthur Miller, it s a great play about crushed dreams. 
ANDY: Sure, I um..I didn't know. Boat 
ANDY: Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk. 
ANDY: Sure. 
ANDY: Sure. 
ANDY: Sure. 
ANDY: Sure. Dooo. Tough room.   Come on. I just learned it. Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. 
ANDY: Sure. I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that. 
ANDY: Sure. What's going on?  
ANDY: Sure? Okay. 
ANDY: Surprise! 
ANDY: Surprise!  It's from everybody. $15 value. 
ANDY: Surprise! Your new crew. 
ANDY: Survey 
ANDY: Swear to God, hope to die. Now let s get to work! 
ANDY: Sweet. 
ANDY: Sweetheart.   Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together. 
ANDY: -take a few breaths, and then I ask 
ANDY: Take care Julia. 
ANDY: Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.   
ANDY: Take that down.   
ANDY: Take. That down. 
ANDY: T-bag bone  
ANDY: Tell me about it, you know? I ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don t know if I m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup. 
ANDY: Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room. 
ANDY: Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed.  and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer, 
ANDY: Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff. 
ANDY: Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day? 
ANDY: Thank you muchly.  
ANDY: Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best. 
ANDY: Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you.  
ANDY: Thank you! 
ANDY: Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend. 
ANDY: Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise. 
ANDY: Thank you, Darryl.  
ANDY: Thank you, David. David 
ANDY: Thank you, Erin. 
ANDY: Thank you, I appreciate that.  Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it. 
ANDY: Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this? 
ANDY: Thank you. 
ANDY: Thank you. 
ANDY: Thank you. 
ANDY: Thank you. 
ANDY: Thank you. 
ANDY: Thank you. 
ANDY: Thank you. 
ANDY: Thank you. 
ANDY: Thank you. 
ANDY: Thank you.   
ANDY: Thank you.  David 
ANDY: Thank you.  David 
ANDY: Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys. 
ANDY: Thank you. David 
ANDY: Thank you. David 
ANDY: Thank you. Great. Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you re talking about? 
ANDY: Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point. 
ANDY: Thank you. Not gonna need it. David 
ANDY: Thank you. That feels good. 
ANDY: Thank you. Yeah, 
ANDY: Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way. 
ANDY: Thanks Dad Darryl. 
ANDY: Thanks for coming in guys. 
ANDY: Thanks, Angela. You too. 
ANDY: Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now. 
ANDY: Thanks, Kevin. 
ANDY: Thanks, man. You, too. Totally. 
ANDY: Thanks, Oscar. 
ANDY: Thanks. 
ANDY: Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt. 
ANDY: That brilliant little bitch. 
ANDY: That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm.  It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it. 
ANDY: That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings. 
ANDY: That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these.  nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself. 
ANDY: That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name? 
ANDY: That is just obnoxious. 
ANDY: That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl. 
ANDY: That is not okay dude. 
ANDY: That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it. Keena 
ANDY: That is so mom. 
ANDY: That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael. 
ANDY: That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day. 
ANDY: That monster of a judge has locked her-. Locked her away.  Sweeney 
ANDY: That really works. 
ANDY: That s a crazy amount of points. 
ANDY: That s how I got my new job in the admissions office. 
ANDY: That s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack. 
ANDY: That s my signature song. HCT Member 
ANDY: That s that s what yeah. Okay, all right, well, here s the song.  Far above Cayuga s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater  
ANDY: That seems a little far-fetched. 
ANDY: That sounds awesome. Can we all do it? 
ANDY: That sounds super inspiring! I'm in! 
ANDY: That sounds weird. 
ANDY: That Swayze sure can dance dirty. 
ANDY: That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It s like a festival of poo. 
ANDY: That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm.  You're all failing right now.  Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail!  
ANDY: That was awful. Robert I apologize. 
ANDY: That was fun last night. 
ANDY: That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like   
ANDY: That was not a fail. 
ANDY: That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question. 
ANDY: That was real?! I thought I dreamed that. Oh, God! 
ANDY: That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain? 
ANDY: That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys. 
ANDY: That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert. 
ANDY: That you re learning a made-up language from HBO s Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out! 
ANDY: That you're sleeping with Dwight. 
ANDY: That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon. 
ANDY: That... you got a promotion!  Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk. 
ANDY: That's a good one. 
ANDY: That's a lie. 
ANDY: That's a racing stripe. 
ANDY: That's actually "Master of Ceremonies" Bernard. 
ANDY: That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment. 
ANDY: That's as hard as I can hint. 
ANDY: That's awesome. 
ANDY: That's clever, Debutante. 
ANDY: That's completely backwards. 
ANDY: That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date. 
ANDY: That's how it works! 
ANDY: That's insane! 
ANDY: That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know? 
ANDY: That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy. 
ANDY: That's it! 
ANDY: That's low, Tuna. 
ANDY: That's mean, come on, that's -   
ANDY: That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too. 
ANDY: That's not different enough. 
ANDY: That's not how that goes. 
ANDY: That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest. 
ANDY: That's not what I had in mind. 
ANDY: That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something. 
ANDY: That's not you. 
ANDY: That's okay, I'm in my "worky-works." You look amazing! 
ANDY: That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P. 
ANDY: That's really good.   
ANDY: That's really nice, thank you. 
ANDY: That's so beautiful. 
ANDY: That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says  action.  Carla 
ANDY: That's the family boat! 
ANDY: That's very generous. 
ANDY: That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something? 
ANDY: That's... 
ANDY: The answer is yes. 
ANDY: The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing. 
ANDY: The bookstore? 
ANDY: The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell. 
ANDY: The conference room! 
ANDY: The cost of doing business. 
ANDY: The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays. 
ANDY: The fax says "Erin, will you have dinner with me?" from Andy, and the number is our office fax number. 
ANDY: The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety. 
ANDY: The fire's shooting at us! 
ANDY: The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts? 
ANDY: The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil. 
ANDY: The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man. 
ANDY: The male is a funny species. We don t just tell each other how we feel, that s chick stuff. So instead of saying,  Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don t want you to leave.  You say something like,  Hey, Andy, you re making the worst mistake of your life. You re not talented.  Well  right back at you, Darryl. 
ANDY: The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace. 
ANDY: The one in the green hoodie. 
ANDY: The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no. 
ANDY: The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly? 
ANDY: The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear!  
ANDY: The temp at night? 
ANDY: The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus.  This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things. 
ANDY: The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes. David 
ANDY: The whole office feels darker, you know? It's just a sad dark day. 
ANDY: Then forget I just told you that. 
ANDY: Then I want my big blue sweater back. 
ANDY: Then I will write it down. 
ANDY: Then I'll get something too. 
ANDY: Then I'll make you. 
ANDY: then I'll take a table! 
ANDY: Then the basil will be fine. 
ANDY: There are lots of considerations. 
ANDY: There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge. 
ANDY: There he is! 
ANDY: There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting. 
ANDY: There is one problem with this plan. 
ANDY: There s a mole? Mark 
ANDY: There s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales  
ANDY: There s lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt. 
ANDY: There was a fire in the warehouse? 
ANDY: There what is? 
ANDY: There you go. Thank you. 
ANDY: There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia. 
ANDY: There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card. 
ANDY: There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old. 
ANDY: There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me.  That is ridiculous. This is how it works.  
ANDY: These are delicious. 
ANDY: These are incentives. It s how we re gonna double growth. Now, you re probably all asking 
ANDY: These cookies are fine. 
ANDY: These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here. 
ANDY: They already have a contract?   Mutually agree to-  Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch. 
ANDY: They are already off, my good sir. Tattoo 
ANDY: They didn t know about the snowman story, and when I told  em, they were not impressed. 
ANDY: They don't know how. 
ANDY: They had, uh  weapons. 
ANDY: They just didn t turn out how I wanted. In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird. 
ANDY: They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates. 
ANDY: They sure do. 
ANDY: They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps. 
ANDY: They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me. 
ANDY: They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene. 
ANDY: They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?' 
ANDY: They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture  
ANDY: They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find. 
ANDY: They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter. 
ANDY: Think we'll find him? 
ANDY: Thinking-- 
ANDY: Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on. 
ANDY: Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that. 
ANDY: Thirty minutes! 
ANDY: Thirty-one. 
ANDY: This branch, I'm the regional manager. 
ANDY: This conversation is over. 
ANDY: This dance competition is not over. 
ANDY: This drink...  
ANDY: This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you! 
ANDY: This guy looks like a real deviant. 
ANDY: This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is. 
ANDY: This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show? 
ANDY: This has been a really tough time. 
ANDY: This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer!  Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them? 
ANDY: This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell? 
ANDY: This is Andy Bernard! 
ANDY: This is awesome! 
ANDY: This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama! 
ANDY: This is for pleasure. 
ANDY: This is getting more and more delicious by the minute.  It's go time. 
ANDY: This is gonna look so awesome! 
ANDY: This is great. 
ANDY: This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy. 
ANDY: This is kinda time sensitive. 
ANDY: This is my solo.   
ANDY: This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party. 
ANDY: This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird.  Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course.  But it makes you wonder. 
ANDY: This is not what I want my relationship to look like.  
ANDY: This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang  I Dreamed a Dream  from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic. 
ANDY: This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us. 
ANDY: This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me 
ANDY: This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life. I haven't had a very hard life. 
ANDY: This is what I was trying to tell you. 
ANDY: This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else? 
ANDY: This is what s under the blanket. 
ANDY: This is where I grin and be-YOW OW! Tattoo 
ANDY: This is where my parents decided not to get divorced. 
ANDY: This is your big day. Come on. 
ANDY: This is your you brought this on. 
ANDY: This kid's costing us sales, Michael. 
ANDY: This man has a gift! 
ANDY: Thornwood Wholesalers. 
ANDY: Those are fully staffed as well. 
ANDY: Thought about it, I'm in. 
ANDY: Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call. 
ANDY: Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad.  
ANDY: Three-oh-five. You my friend are winning handsomely. 
ANDY: Through the use of force. 
ANDY: Time! 
ANDY: Time's up! 
ANDY: To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it. 
ANDY: Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity. 
ANDY: Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all. 
ANDY: Tom Brokaw! 
ANDY: Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip. 
ANDY: Tonight. 
ANDY: Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing.   Shh... 
ANDY: Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete? 
ANDY: Took  em one day. 
ANDY: Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing. 
ANDY: Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam. 
ANDY: Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas.  
ANDY: Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what s up? Back in the small pond? 
ANDY: Totally. 
ANDY: Totally.   What--- Who? 
ANDY: Totally... not.  
ANDY: Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. I just feel good! 
ANDY: Trust me it would only make you mad.  
ANDY: Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing. 
ANDY: Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning. 
ANDY: Try and hide it, I will track this party down! 
ANDY: Try and keep me from coming! 
ANDY: Trying to get a head count. 
ANDY: Tuna! 
ANDY: Tuna!  I'm engaged! 
ANDY: TUNA! Are you kidding me!! 
ANDY: Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party? 
ANDY: Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner?  I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna!  These are for you.  
ANDY: Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok? 
ANDY: Tuna, I m a performer. And perform I shall.  
ANDY: Tuna.  
ANDY: Tuna... You're completely sane. 
ANDY: Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? 
ANDY: Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go. 
ANDY: Twenty points. 
ANDY: Twenty seconds to go time. 
ANDY: Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant. 
ANDY: Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.  Bill 
ANDY: Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time? 
ANDY: Ugh, oh god! 
ANDY: Ugh. 
ANDY: Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car. 
ANDY: Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement. W.B. 
ANDY: Uh oh! Oh! Oh!   
ANDY: Uh yeah, look at that. 
ANDY: Uh you tell me  
ANDY: Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves. 
ANDY: Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember? 
ANDY: Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato. 
ANDY: Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives. 
ANDY: Uh, did you need something? 
ANDY: Uh, dream. Goin  with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn t that right, Jim? 
ANDY: Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before? 
ANDY: Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don t squash my knickety-knacks on top. 
ANDY: Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now? 
ANDY: Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you. 
ANDY: Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die. 
ANDY: Uh, I'll hear the other one. 
ANDY: Uh, maybe we could talk in private? 
ANDY: Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to? 
ANDY: Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now. 
ANDY: Uh, not familiar, what province is he from? 
ANDY: Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something? 
ANDY: Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do. 
ANDY: Uh, that's not what was- 
ANDY: Uh, this has got to stop. 
ANDY: Uh, yeah. Should have said so.  Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa-- 
ANDY: Uh... 
ANDY: Uh... 
ANDY: Uh... 
ANDY: Uh...   
ANDY: Uhh, beg your pardon? 
ANDY: Uh-huh. 
ANDY: Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl. 
ANDY: Uh-huh...  Uh-huh.  Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed. 
ANDY: Um Phyllis, who's that? 
ANDY: Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty...  Hello? Pretty good. 
ANDY: Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through? 
ANDY: Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great.  maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut.  Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing? 
ANDY: Um, cheeseburger. 
ANDY: Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG. 
ANDY: Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here. 
ANDY: Um, nerthing? 
ANDY: Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall? 
ANDY: Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing?  In your face! 
ANDY: Um, what are we talking price wise? 
ANDY: Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um... 
ANDY: Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell... 
ANDY: Um. 
ANDY: Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only. 
ANDY: Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable? 
ANDY: Umm, on the contrary. 
ANDY: Umm... I'm number three. 
ANDY: Umpf that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there. 
ANDY: Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am.  So... we should probably... go. 
ANDY: Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour. 
ANDY: Up high. 
ANDY: Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis. 
ANDY: Val, I need the space. 
ANDY: Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem "too eager," so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit. 
ANDY: Vanilla.  Vanilla Ice. It was a band. 
ANDY: Very cool. 
ANDY: Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that. 
ANDY: Very very smart. 
ANDY: Wahhh... 
ANDY: Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again? 
ANDY: Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you? 
ANDY: Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting. 
ANDY: Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with? 
ANDY: Wait, wait. Andy and 
ANDY: Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff. 
ANDY: Wait, what? 
ANDY: Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay? 
ANDY: Wait. Seriously? 
ANDY: Walk around apple orchards. 
ANDY: Wanted to talk to all of you guys about  importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important. 
ANDY: Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be? 
ANDY: Was that hot or what? 
ANDY: Was the top salesman... 
ANDY: WB! 
ANDY: We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left. 
ANDY: We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off!  Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing. 
ANDY: We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down. 
ANDY: We are going to find out where the action is, my friend. 
ANDY: We called Angela? 
ANDY: We could write a strong-worded letter. 
ANDY: We couldn t crack it. 
ANDY: We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers! 
ANDY: We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho! 
ANDY: We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting.  Hang on. Hello? 
ANDY: We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it. 
ANDY: We had to leave because of creative differences. 
ANDY: We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I. 
ANDY: We have to clean this up now! 
ANDY: We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers. 
ANDY: We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead. 
ANDY: We kinda nailed it. 
ANDY: We lost the account. 
ANDY: We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.  
ANDY: We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot. 
ANDY: We need you, OK? Darryl:OK. 
ANDY: We promised we d never say goodbye. 
ANDY: We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um... but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama. 
ANDY: We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together? 
ANDY: We should still have that talk. Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45?  Cool. 
ANDY: We should think about this does anyone have any better ideas? 
ANDY: We will be team U.S.A. 
ANDY: We will start here at Erinville. 
ANDY: We won't let you down. 
ANDY: Website check please. 
ANDY: We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this. 
ANDY: Welcome back Tuna! 
ANDY: Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog. Older 
ANDY: Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl. What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off? 
ANDY: Welcome. 
ANDY: Well- 
ANDY: Well- 
ANDY: Well- 
ANDY: Well - 
ANDY: Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but... 
ANDY: Well are you? 
ANDY: Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?!  
ANDY: We'll discuss it later naked. I want to see you naked. 
ANDY: Well first of all, I'd just like to say  what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen. W.B. 
ANDY: We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you? 
ANDY: Well girls tell each other things right? 
ANDY: Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me. 
ANDY: Well I don't see that happening. 
ANDY: Well I have the, the blue book value... 
ANDY: Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I m gonna thank people. 
ANDY: Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying. 
ANDY: Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing. 
ANDY: Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it. 
ANDY: Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway. 
ANDY: Well it s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool. 
ANDY: Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in.. 
ANDY: Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so-- 
ANDY: Well it's the thought that counts. 
ANDY: Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go... 
ANDY: Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like,  "Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries." 
ANDY: Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation. 
ANDY: Well now hold on it, it- 
ANDY: Well played. 
ANDY: Well someone could answer if they want to.  Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil.  
ANDY: Well that's Dallas. 
ANDY: Well that's not-- 
ANDY: Well that's not what we agreed on. 
ANDY: Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes  
ANDY: Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it. 
ANDY: Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice? 
ANDY: Well then no Andy Bernard per se.  
ANDY: Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it. 
ANDY: Well there you go. That's muy caliente. 
ANDY: Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago. 
ANDY: Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that. 
ANDY: We'll use code names. 
ANDY: Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes. 
ANDY: Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up. 
ANDY: Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm.   You're supposed to cook these, aren't you? 
ANDY: Well you're gonna have to.  
ANDY: Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000. 
ANDY: Well, ah, ah... 
ANDY: Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard.  
ANDY: Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much. 
ANDY: Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum. 
ANDY: Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It s a really cool show, it s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean! 
ANDY: Well, but it- 
ANDY: Well, Carla knows. 
ANDY: Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends. 
ANDY: Well, hello. 
ANDY: Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets?  
ANDY: Well, how do you like these apples?   Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude?   Guy at 
ANDY: Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal. 
ANDY: Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes. 
ANDY: Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em. 
ANDY: Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat.  But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps. 
ANDY: Well, I know.  Just want... I mean...  
ANDY: Well, I think down s better. Sweating pretty heavily down there. 
ANDY: Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos. 
ANDY: Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say? 
ANDY: Well, I will take that as a maybe.  Where are you going? 
ANDY: Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK? 
ANDY: Well, I... 
ANDY: Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that. 
ANDY: Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale. 
ANDY: Well, I'm not signing away my rights. 
ANDY: Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either. 
ANDY: Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big. 
ANDY: Well, it is very gracious of you to accept. 
ANDY: Well, it s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right? 
ANDY: Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that. 
ANDY: Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh! 
ANDY: Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now. 
ANDY: Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don t it just  I owe it to myself and my future fans. David 
ANDY: Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes. 
ANDY: Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though. 
ANDY: Well, okay then. 
ANDY: Well, please tell Susan we all say hi. 
ANDY: Well, so what? Your body's a ten. 
ANDY: Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing. 
ANDY: Well, technically FOR Andy. 
ANDY: Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board. 
ANDY: Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it. 
ANDY: Well, that went pretty well. 
ANDY: Well, that, what's that one? 
ANDY: Well, that...really bums me out. 
ANDY: Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he s hard to love, but did you know that he s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships? 
ANDY: Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight. 
ANDY: Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more. 
ANDY: Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road. Bus 
ANDY: Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something.  Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this.  Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe.  
ANDY: Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us.  
ANDY: Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight. 
ANDY: Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay! 
ANDY: Well, well, well, look who it is. 
ANDY: Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know. 
ANDY: Well, what do you want? 
ANDY: Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan? 
ANDY: Well, why don t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here. 
ANDY: Well, why don't you just move the M&M's? 
ANDY: Well, you do actually. You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth. 
ANDY: Well, you got it this year too. 
ANDY: Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so... 
ANDY: Well... 
ANDY: Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but- 
ANDY: Well... there's no instructions. 
ANDY: We're done Meredith. 
ANDY: We're done. Erin and I are over. 
ANDY: We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down? 
ANDY: We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit. 
ANDY: We're gonna do it outside. 
ANDY: We're just friends, okay? 
ANDY: We're just like, totally caught in the middle here. 
ANDY: We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio.  
ANDY: We're losing cloud cover. 
ANDY: We're on the German team. Shoot the Brittish. 
ANDY: We're one in a million. 
ANDY: We're taking a picture. 
ANDY: We're the cast of Sweeney 
ANDY: Wet Tuna! 
ANDY: Wha- 
ANDY: Wha, it's- 
ANDY: Wha...? 
ANDY: Wha? Oh, burn.  Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now? 
ANDY: What about a cat eating man food? 
ANDY: What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever. 
ANDY: What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now. 
ANDY: What are we gonna do about this? 
ANDY: What are you doing here? 
ANDY: What are you doing? It's 5 to 5. 
ANDY: What are you going to see? 
ANDY: What are you gonna do with all this time? 
ANDY: What are you gonna play mange on faster? 
ANDY: What are you guys talking about? 
ANDY: What are you still doing not at your desk? 
ANDY: What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you. 
ANDY: What are you thinking? 
ANDY: What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention? 
ANDY: What are you... 
ANDY: What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager? 
ANDY: What can I do for ya Hoss? 
ANDY: What can't go on? 
ANDY: What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what? 
ANDY: What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. 
ANDY: What do I put you down for, bro hombre? 
ANDY: What do I see in Angela? 
ANDY: What do you got? 
ANDY: What do you got? 
ANDY: What do you mean again? 
ANDY: What do you mean, take my job? 
ANDY: What do you mean? 
ANDY: What do you think of Angela? 
ANDY: What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool. 
ANDY: What do you think? 
ANDY: What do you think? 
ANDY: What does this say? 
ANDY: What else can I show you? Oh, damn it! 
ANDY: What happened in there? 
ANDY: What happened to old salty? 
ANDY: What happened? What can I do to help? 
ANDY: What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara.  
ANDY: What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it. 
ANDY: What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost. 
ANDY: What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy? 
ANDY: What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company? David 
ANDY: What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush? 
ANDY: What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep? 
ANDY: What if you re being attacked by a   smallish man who happens to not have a groin? 
ANDY: What if you re being attacked by a 4 11  man who is penisless? 
ANDY: What is all that? 
ANDY: What is goin' on?!  
ANDY: What is it, Big Haircut? 
ANDY: What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it-   Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?! 
ANDY: What is wrong with her? 
ANDY: What is wrong with you? 
ANDY: What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right? 
ANDY: What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it. Mark 
ANDY: What re you still doing here? 
ANDY: What s the mouse s name? 
ANDY: What s the story? 
ANDY: What s this? 
ANDY: What s up, guys? Just thought we d have a little rap session, talk about business see how things are going? Ahem  
ANDY: What s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk. 
ANDY: What the heck was that? 
ANDY: What the hell is this all about?  You're flipping my car for profit. 
ANDY: What was that? 
ANDY: What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there? 
ANDY: What we have here is a classic misunderstanding. 
ANDY: What! 
ANDY: What, is it because he's black? 
ANDY: What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state. 
ANDY: WHAT? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What? 
ANDY: What?  Morning, Stanley. 
ANDY: What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.  
ANDY: What? Based on what? 
ANDY: What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday. 
ANDY: What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team. 
ANDY: What? No, why? 
ANDY: What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty. 
ANDY: What? Sorry. 
ANDY: What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy. 
ANDY: What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager? 
ANDY: What? You don't know what it meant? How about "Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?" 
ANDY: What? You stupid idiot!   You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods... 
ANDY: What? You're kid-- That's-- You're-- 
ANDY: What?! 
ANDY: What?! 
ANDY: What?! 
ANDY: What?! 
ANDY: WHAT?? 
ANDY: What?? Walter 
ANDY: Whatever. I won't-I won't stand for it. 
ANDY: Whatever. I'm the one blending in. 
ANDY: What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified. 
ANDY: What's bad? 
ANDY: What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it.  I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! . 
ANDY: What's going on? 
ANDY: What's that, Stanley? 
ANDY: What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry? 
ANDY: What's the occasion? 
ANDY: What's up, gangstas? 
ANDY: What's up, man? 
ANDY: What's up? 
ANDY: What's up? 
ANDY: What's up? I got your e-mail. 
ANDY: When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance. 
ANDY: When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day. Bernard's Regards. 
ANDY: When I was a salesman I could just be like  Not my job, not my prob. I m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.  Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob. 
ANDY: When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke. I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class. Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses. They called me Ace. It was totally awesome. Got straight B's. They called me Buzz. 
ANDY: When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back 
ANDY: When what?   When what? 
ANDY: Where are we in the process? 
ANDY: Where are you going? 
ANDY: Where did you get this?! 
ANDY: Where is my FREAKING phone?! 
ANDY: Where...  
ANDY: Where? 
ANDY: Where? 
ANDY: Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility.  I m all for it. 
ANDY: Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse? 
ANDY: Where'd you learn how to puppet like that? 
ANDY: Where's Dwight? 
ANDY: Where's the concierge? 
ANDY: which I will not be a part of- 
ANDY: Which is insanely painful. 
ANDY: Which is like, "Right on." And Pam was like "blah blah blah" and you were like "Yeah, psht." Nailed it. 
ANDY: Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now   I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime. Mr. 
ANDY: Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film? 
ANDY: Which one did you see? 
ANDY: White, because it contains all other colors. 
ANDY: White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster. 
ANDY: Who are your role models? 
ANDY: Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is? 
ANDY: Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things. 
ANDY: Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice? 
ANDY: Who else knows about it? 
ANDY: Who else? 
ANDY: Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator. 
ANDY: Who is it? 
ANDY: Who is ready for dinner? "oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid". No.  I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves    A Jamaican feast, mon!  
ANDY: Who is the gal in question? 
ANDY: Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire. David 
ANDY: Who knows? 
ANDY: Who says that? 
ANDY: Who was Cornell's eighth president? 
ANDY: Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker. 
ANDY: Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'? 
ANDY: Whoa-- 
ANDY: Whoa-- thank you very much.  Oh boy. 
ANDY: Whoa! 
ANDY: Whoa! 
ANDY: Whoa! And he just goes, "Boom".   Goal! 
ANDY: Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert. 
ANDY: Whoa! Maybe you should take a break. 
ANDY: Whoa! Mind blown. It s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr? 
ANDY: Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay. 
ANDY: Whoa! What is crackin? 
ANDY: Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here? 
ANDY: Whoa! What's the situation? 
ANDY: Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here? HCT Member 
ANDY: Whoa, fire! 
ANDY: Whoa, where you going? 
ANDY: Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this. 
ANDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? Check-in 
ANDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can t do that. You can t do that, we ve all been waiting. Check-in 
ANDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the "Vagina Monologues" called the "Penis Apologies." So I know a thing or two. 
ANDY: Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle? You're in for a spanking my friend. Myself and my lady? - no secrets. 
ANDY: Whoa. 
ANDY: Whoa. 
ANDY: Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night. 
ANDY: Whoa. Okay. 
ANDY: Whoa. Well I gave him a chance.  
ANDY: Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about. 
ANDY: Whoa-oh-oh-oh 
ANDY: Whoa-oh-oh-oh. 
ANDY: Who'd you get? 
ANDY: Whoever it is, I think they should be lame.  Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality. 
ANDY: Whoo! We did it!  
ANDY: Whoo. 
ANDY: Who's excited to get their holiday wishes? 
ANDY: Whose your favorite iron chef? 
ANDY: Why can't I be in the club? 
ANDY: Why did we pretend like we work here? 
ANDY: Why did you do that?! 
ANDY: Why does Erin like Gabe? 
ANDY: Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places. 
ANDY: Why don t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this. 
ANDY: Why don t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man. 
ANDY: Why don't you take a seat, you idiot?  
ANDY: Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting. 
ANDY: Why don't you, uh, stay away from me? 
ANDY: Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that? 
ANDY: Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car. 
ANDY: Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it s a little much?  Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that s what it feels like. 
ANDY: Why is the truck empty? 
ANDY: Why not, dawg? 
ANDY: Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being. 
ANDY: Why should I believe that? 
ANDY: Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like "Oh, this guy's going to fail this class," or, "What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, "Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted." ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous. Hospital 
ANDY: Why would anyone frame you for that? 
ANDY: Why would people say that? 
ANDY: Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day? 
ANDY: Why would that be weird? 
ANDY: Why would that make me a pervert, I - 
ANDY: Why would you say that? 
ANDY: Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up? 
ANDY: Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy? 
ANDY: Why? Everybody's heard it. 
ANDY: Why? Is it employee s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays. 
ANDY: Why? Why?  
ANDY: Will do, boss-man. 
ANDY: Will end completely! 
ANDY: Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill. 
ANDY: Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor? 
ANDY: Wingman for life. W.M.F.L 
ANDY: With fury... 
ANDY: With Hors d'oeuvres we only take one at a time. 
ANDY: Women friends? 
ANDY: Woo! 
ANDY: Woo! 
ANDY: Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back. 
ANDY: Woo-hoo. 
ANDY: Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive? 
ANDY: Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice. 
ANDY: Would you rather me say "Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?" 
ANDY: Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with? 
ANDY: Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so... 
ANDY: Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together? 
ANDY: Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up. 
ANDY: Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder. 
ANDY: Wow, that's wonderful! 
ANDY: Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these? 
ANDY: Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool. 
ANDY: Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that s the show. Let me try a different song, okay? Aaron 
ANDY: Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes. 
ANDY: Wow. 
ANDY: Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too  
ANDY: Wow. From janitor to manager? 
ANDY: Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50. 
ANDY: Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels? 
ANDY: Wow. Prison sounds horrible. 
ANDY: Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird. 
ANDY: W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times. 
ANDY: Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party. 
ANDY: Yay!  Whoa! 
ANDY: Yea? 
ANDY: Yeah and we re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes. 
ANDY: Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else... 
ANDY: Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients. 
ANDY: Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders. 
ANDY: Yeah it does. 
ANDY: Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad. 
ANDY: Yeah Jim, get it out there. 
ANDY: Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road. 
ANDY: Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now. 
ANDY: Yeah um, how is everything? 
ANDY: Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand. 
ANDY: Yeah! 
ANDY: Yeah! 
ANDY: Yeah! 
ANDY: Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and...  333,000 times heavier than the Earth,... 
ANDY: Yeah! I love the vibe down here. 
ANDY: Yeah! I mean it's a great song. I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway. You know? 
ANDY: Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there. 
ANDY: Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me! 
ANDY: Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted! 
ANDY: Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It's me. 
ANDY: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
ANDY: Yeah! Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah, absolutely! 
ANDY: Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall. 
ANDY: Yeah, but  My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool. 
ANDY: Yeah, but here s the thing. I can t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners. 
ANDY: Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So... 
ANDY: Yeah, but I'm number three. 
ANDY: Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto. 
ANDY: Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down! 
ANDY: Yeah, cause when everyone knows-  That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know. 
ANDY: Yeah, come on in. I m just on hold with another talent agency. It s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there s more. 251. 252. I can t even keep up! 
ANDY: Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up. 
ANDY: Yeah, Dwight. 
ANDY: Yeah, even cooler. 
ANDY: Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now? 
ANDY: Yeah, fine. Boat 
ANDY: Yeah, good. Can we---   Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!! 
ANDY: Yeah, how do you play? 
ANDY: Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back. 
ANDY: Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him. 
ANDY: Yeah, I do. I have that. 
ANDY: Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire. 
ANDY: Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck. 
ANDY: Yeah, I gotta go David.  Why is Nellie still here? 
ANDY: Yeah, I guess you could say that. 
ANDY: Yeah, I guess. 
ANDY: Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success. 
ANDY: Yeah, I killed. 
ANDY: Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there. Boat 
ANDY: Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane.  
ANDY: Yeah, I know. 
ANDY: Yeah, I know. Neiche! 
ANDY: Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it. 
ANDY: Yeah, I took intro to philosophy, twice. No big deal. 
ANDY: Yeah, if I had my own-- 
ANDY: Yeah, it is actually. 
ANDY: Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish? 
ANDY: Yeah, it sounds like it. 
ANDY: Yeah, it was. That s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out. Ow! 
ANDY: Yeah, it's a kilt. Night cleaning 
ANDY: Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one. 
ANDY: Yeah, its where they make stuff. 
ANDY: Yeah, me, too. 
ANDY: Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese. 
ANDY: Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate. 
ANDY: Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did.  
ANDY: Yeah, OK. 
ANDY: Yeah, ok. 
ANDY: Yeah, Ok.  Alright. Where were we? 
ANDY: Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here? 
ANDY: Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo!  
ANDY: Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug. 
ANDY: Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped. 
ANDY: Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon!  
ANDY: Yeah, right, I mean-  
ANDY: Yeah, right? 
ANDY: Yeah, right? 
ANDY: Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around? 
ANDY: Yeah, sell. 
ANDY: Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun. 
ANDY: Yeah, so, I ll see you on the red carpet. See, that s how it works. 
ANDY: Yeah, some of that existed before. 
ANDY: Yeah, sure, I ll talk about it. Why not? American s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say  Casey 
ANDY: Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu.  
ANDY: Yeah, sure. What s your question? 
ANDY: Yeah, that's awesome. That's great. 
ANDY: Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like... 
ANDY: Yeah, there it is. You're welcome. 
ANDY: Yeah, uh, excuse me. 
ANDY: Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff. 
ANDY: Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height. 
ANDY: Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin  movie star!  
ANDY: Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock. 
ANDY: Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul. 
ANDY: Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal? 
ANDY: Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists. 
ANDY: Yeah, what day? What day? 
ANDY: Yeah, which one? 
ANDY: Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that? 
ANDY: Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter? 
ANDY: Yeah, yeah, it's great... 
ANDY: Yeah, yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah, yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah, yeah. Put me on that. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Yeah.  
ANDY: Yeah.  That makes sense. OK. Good, alright. 
ANDY: Yeah. All right! 
ANDY: Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in? 
ANDY: Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause  
ANDY: Yeah. D for Andy. 
ANDY: Yeah. David 
ANDY: Yeah. Everyone 
ANDY: Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able. 
ANDY: Yeah. He's in rehab actually. 
ANDY: Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage. 
ANDY: Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all.  
ANDY: Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal. 
ANDY: Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so... two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one. 
ANDY: Yeah. I really like her with all my heart. 
ANDY: Yeah. I was gonna sing that part. 
ANDY: Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to. 
ANDY: Yeah. It's pretty close. 
ANDY: Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of. 
ANDY: Yeah. Name another. 
ANDY: Yeah. No. Well, ok. 
ANDY: Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it.  Well, yeah, whatever. So.  
ANDY: Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine? 
ANDY: Yeah. On Clearview Avenue. Keena 
ANDY: Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis.  Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok,  blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable. 
ANDY: Yeah. Right. 
ANDY: Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. . 
ANDY: Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful. 
ANDY: Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out. 
ANDY: Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just- 
ANDY: Yeah. Um line 1? 
ANDY: Yeah. We are thrilled. 
ANDY: Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering. 
ANDY: Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line. 
ANDY: Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  Walt? Walt 
ANDY: Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny. 
ANDY: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up. 
ANDY: Yeah. You don't have to ask me.  
ANDY: Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim. 
ANDY: Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook- 
ANDY: Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry.  So you had a bad day- 
ANDY: Yeah... 
ANDY: Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast? 
ANDY: Yeah? 
ANDY: Yeah? 
ANDY: Yeah? 
ANDY: Yeah? 
ANDY: Yeah? Pretty cool, huh? 
ANDY: Yeah? You like it? 
ANDY: Yeeeeah. 
ANDY: Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness. 
ANDY: Yep. 
ANDY: Yep.  Hey! 
ANDY: Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera. 
ANDY: Yep. This is Erin. 
ANDY: Yes I am, as a matter of fact. 
ANDY: Yes I can. 
ANDY: Yes I will. 
ANDY: Yes like a chime or a bell... 
ANDY: Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it. What are you gonna do? Cry about it?  Excuse me. 
ANDY: Yes! 
ANDY: Yes! 
ANDY: Yes! 
ANDY: Yes! 
ANDY: Yes! 
ANDY: Yes! 
ANDY: Yes!   Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram! Phyllis and 
ANDY: Yes!  And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory. 
ANDY: Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on! 
ANDY: Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else?  Sold! Anybody else?  Yes! All right! 
ANDY: Yes! Can anyone do those? 
ANDY: Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna. 
ANDY: Yes! I m sorry I m being curt, it s just I m about to land a top talent agent. 
ANDY: Yes! I'm in. 
ANDY: Yes! Thank you! Such as? 
ANDY: Yes! The dude is an enigma. 
ANDY: Yes! Yeah.   Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! 
ANDY: Yes! Yes. 
ANDY: Yes, a madhouse. Sweeney 
ANDY: Yes, but one good text away from a high five. 
ANDY: Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev! 
ANDY: Yes, I do. 
ANDY: Yes, I do. Phyllis. 
ANDY: Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible. 
ANDY: Yes, it's Eddie. 
ANDY: Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow.  In the trash. 
ANDY: Yes, unplanned pregnancy. 
ANDY: Yes, yes, yes! 
ANDY: Yes. 
ANDY: Yes. 
ANDY: Yes. 
ANDY: Yes. 
ANDY: Yes. 
ANDY: Yes. 
ANDY: Yes. 
ANDY: Yes. 
ANDY: Yes.  Come on. Totally. 
ANDY: Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom. 
ANDY: Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend. 
ANDY: Yes? 
ANDY: Yikes! 
ANDY: Yo! Bad boys of a capella. 
ANDY: Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had. 
ANDY: Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike. 
ANDY: Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet? 
ANDY: Yo. 
ANDY: Yo. Dudeces. 
ANDY: Yo. I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here? 
ANDY: You all made it, thank you so much. 
ANDY: You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa! 
ANDY: You are murdering the Nard-dog! 
ANDY: You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit. 
ANDY: You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me. 
ANDY: You bet. 
ANDY: You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone. 
ANDY: You broke my heart too. 
ANDY: You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this. 
ANDY: You can have this back at the end of the day.  Oh!! 
ANDY: You can't call a meeting.  But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting. 
ANDY: You can't dock my pay- 
ANDY: You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago. 
ANDY: You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.' 
ANDY: You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once. 
ANDY: You can't. You can't. 
ANDY: You did not, Kenny! 
ANDY: You didn t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now s your chance! I m here. You got Qs; I got As. HCT Member 
ANDY: You didn t let me finish. That s not fair. Aaron 
ANDY: You didn't have to do that. 
ANDY: You do have a fantastic basement. 
ANDY: You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players. 
ANDY: You don t have any-- Any questions about the old days?  You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ? HCT Member 
ANDY: You don t like the hats? 
ANDY: You don't have a toothbrush? 
ANDY: You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason. 
ANDY: You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki. 
ANDY: You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A. 
ANDY: You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness. 
ANDY: You give up? 
ANDY: You go first. 
ANDY: You got a minute? 
ANDY: You got it. 
ANDY: You got it. 
ANDY: You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor.  Boat 
ANDY: You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control. 
ANDY: You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life. 
ANDY: You guys came. Where s everyone else? 
ANDY: You guys ready to party? 
ANDY: You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying. 
ANDY: You guys, they're making out. 
ANDY: You guys... 
ANDY: You guys... 
ANDY: You hadn't noticed she's a woman? 
ANDY: You have his email? 
ANDY: You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase. 
ANDY: You have to. 
ANDY: You have your team. 
ANDY: You humiliated me in front of every body! 
ANDY: You just use whichever one is sitting there? 
ANDY: You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards.   
ANDY: You know Darryl? 
ANDY: You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died. 
ANDY: You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute. 
ANDY: You know I'm the worst salesman here right? 
ANDY: You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone. 
ANDY: You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends? 
ANDY: You know what else?  The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties.  
ANDY: You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance. 
ANDY: You know what--- I don't--- 
ANDY: You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I m so not prepared. 
ANDY: You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund. 
ANDY: You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too. 
ANDY: You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just-  wow. Boat 
ANDY: You know what? Go. Have fun. 
ANDY: You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much. 
ANDY: You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be?  Tuna. 
ANDY: You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. I stepped in and I didn t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves,  Where were you when the girls came?  
ANDY: You know your soccer, man. 
ANDY: You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me. 
ANDY: You know, I don t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog s outta here, so letting it all hang out! 
ANDY: You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go. 
ANDY: You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me? 
ANDY: You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada. 
ANDY: You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time. 
ANDY: You know, the marmalade sounds great. 
ANDY: You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.  Okay, Kevin did that. I do not wish I was in Dixie.  Hey mom, how are ya? Did any Bernards ever own a plantation in the south?  She said no! Take that!  Follow up question. Did any Bernards, ever, make money, in an unsavory way?  I just asked you! Why didn't you just say that?  Oh, stop! Stop! Stop talking! Stop taking! That's no! I don't wanna know that. Ok. You're interrupting a meeting I have to go. Love you. Bye.  Well, turns out the Bernard's of yore did not own slaves. 
ANDY: You know, we ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we re in this weird dance . 
ANDY: You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused. 
ANDY: You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you. 
ANDY: You look awesome. 
ANDY: You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us.  Watch, watch, watch, watch.  Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya? 
ANDY: You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite! 
ANDY: You make a chair, but you don't sit on it. 
ANDY: You mean a moon bounce. 
ANDY: You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon! 
ANDY: You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker. 
ANDY: You my friend are in a very close second. 
ANDY: You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells. 
ANDY: You never told me you were in high-school! 
ANDY: You never update it. 
ANDY: You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here. 
ANDY: You re exactly right and you get a point. 
ANDY: You said your upper back itched. 
ANDY: You said...  
ANDY: You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there.  Don't be a wuss. 
ANDY: You sure it's saber? 
ANDY: You sure? 
ANDY: You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so... 
ANDY: You think I can do better? 
ANDY: You think it has something to do with that incentive program? 
ANDY: You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man s signature solo is his for life, okay? That s group policy and you know it. Broccoli 
ANDY: You up for a chest bump? 
ANDY: You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar? 
ANDY: You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store.  Aaaah! You got a leaky spark tube. 
ANDY: You wanted to see me? 
ANDY: You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you. 
ANDY: You were saying you chose me . There was a reason? 
ANDY: You were? 
ANDY: You would? 
ANDY: You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something. 
ANDY: You? 
ANDY: You'll thank me when they spank thee. 
ANDY: Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc. 
ANDY: Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours. 
ANDY: Your hands. 
ANDY: Your text said 911. 
ANDY: Your wish is my command. 
ANDY: You're a hoarder. My god! 
ANDY: You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind. 
ANDY: You're asking him to give up all of his power. 
ANDY: You're being a Thomas Oregon! 
ANDY: You're being an idiot get.. 
ANDY: You're choking him! 
ANDY: You're four seasons in a day.  You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba-  Put if you put on a blue...  It's Spring Time in the Rockies! 
ANDY: You're going to believe that guy? 
ANDY: You're gonna lose all of our money. 
ANDY: You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless. 
ANDY: You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen. 
ANDY: You're not making any sense. 
ANDY: You're not? 
ANDY: You're right, that is new. 
ANDY: You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe-- 
ANDY: You're running from the problem. 
ANDY: You're welcome. 
ANDY: You're welcome. 
ANDY:: Yes. And yes.  
ANGEL: Please and thank you go a long way. 
ANGELA/PAM: Unbelievable!

ANGELA:   
ANGELA:   
ANGELA:     Has this been on the entire time? 
ANGELA:    Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now. 
ANGELA:   Bandit, No! No no no! 
ANGELA:   Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok? 
ANGELA:   Hello, Charles? Charles! 
ANGELA:   Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good. 
ANGELA:   Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and- 
ANGELA:   Hello? Hello? 
ANGELA:   Hey! 
ANGELA:   Hurry, we have to make this fast. 
ANGELA:   I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest. 
ANGELA:   I can't believe they're gonna fight over me. 
ANGELA:   I will respect the results of the duel. 
ANGELA:   It's okay. Shh shhh. 
ANGELA:   Let me think about it... I, um... there...   
ANGELA:   Let's talk about this later.   
ANGELA:   Now, I have to take care of a legal issue. 
ANGELA:   That's good. Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready? 
ANGELA:   Well, sorry I'm late.   
ANGELA:  ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me... 
ANGELA:  ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum  
ANGELA:  All right! 
ANGELA:  Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator? 
ANGELA:  Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now  
ANGELA:  Amen. 
ANGELA:  And that blue busty gal? What's her story? 
ANGELA:  Copy, Possum. What's your twenty? 
ANGELA:  Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard? 
ANGELA:  Dwight! What the  is your problem! 
ANGELA:  Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight! Senator 
ANGELA:  Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me.  
ANGELA:  For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity. 
ANGELA:  Four, one, seven, one... 
ANGELA:  Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies. 
ANGELA:  Goodness. 
ANGELA:  Hey! 
ANGELA:  I don t get the point of this stupid window! 
ANGELA:  I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing. 
ANGELA:  I love him. 
ANGELA:  I need to know if I can start the party? 
ANGELA:  I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum. 
ANGELA:  I said I didn't want to be on the internet! 
ANGELA:  I think the senator is having an affair. 
ANGELA:  I ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let s go. 
ANGELA:  I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub? 
ANGELA:  I'm not depressed I'm in grief. 
ANGELA:  It explains so much. 
ANGELA:  It s just a really nice song. 
ANGELA:  It was an unfortunate error. We're fixing it. And you already got your money back... 
ANGELA:  It's a man eating cat food. 
ANGELA:  Jazz is stupid! I mean, just play the right notes! 
ANGELA:  Kevin, stop it with that question. 
ANGELA:  Kevin, you can do this. 
ANGELA:  Kitchen. 
ANGELA:  Language. 
ANGELA:  Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum.. 
ANGELA:  My boyfriend can, he's a state senator. 
ANGELA:  No cookie. 
ANGELA:  No! Don't! 
ANGELA:  No, no! 
ANGELA:  No, no. 
ANGELA:  No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is. 
ANGELA:  No. Todd 
ANGELA:  Not now.  Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor. 
ANGELA:  Oh my God! 
ANGELA:  Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn.  Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman? 
ANGELA:  Oh my God. 
ANGELA:  Oh, it is warm. 
ANGELA:  Oh, Robert, you're horrible.  Simon, Maxine.  Who let you guys in here? Athlead 
ANGELA:  Oh. Oh. 
ANGELA:  Oh. Thank you. 
ANGELA:  Okay, we should go now. Let s go. 
ANGELA:  Okay.  How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens. 
ANGELA:  Outside my car in two minutes. 
ANGELA:  Pam, how's your day going? 
ANGELA:  Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now. 
ANGELA:  Really? 
ANGELA:  Really?  
ANGELA:  See the duckie! 
ANGELA:  Slower. Slower. Meredith.  Slow it up. 
ANGELA:  Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350. 
ANGELA:  Thank you. 
ANGELA:  Thank you. 
ANGELA:  This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there s a problem it s clearly on your end. And oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um  what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting!  
ANGELA:  To remind you that our wedding s gonna be wonderful. 
ANGELA:  Ugh! 
ANGELA:  Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change. 
ANGELA:  Uh, no. It s o thank you. You know what? You don t have to oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It s okay. 
ANGELA:  Uhh! 
ANGELA:  We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too. 
ANGELA:  We re very close. We even have our own special language. 
ANGELA:  We should do it right here in the break room.  
ANGELA:  Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely. 
ANGELA:  Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again. 
ANGELA:  Well... good for Dwight. 
ANGELA:  What about the Halloween party? 
ANGELA:  What are you doing? 
ANGELA:  What are you looking at? 
ANGELA:  What is that?  The "Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?" There's no such thing as the "Committee to Plan Parties." 
ANGELA:  Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want?  He's upset about the watermark. 
ANGELA:  Who's this guy by our cars? 
ANGELA:  Will you help me? 
ANGELA:  Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace.  Look at Meredith. She s disgusting. Those feet. They re like the paws of an orangutan. 
ANGELA:  You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood. 
ANGELA: "It could only be you!" Way to go. 
ANGELA: ... doing the work that could be done by two. 
ANGELA: ... that has three people... 
ANGELA: ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not.   I think he had Tourette's or something! 
ANGELA: ...but it's totally inappropriate. 
ANGELA: ...Okay. 
ANGELA: 1434-967, paid. 
ANGELA: A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don t know if I should call social services about it. 
ANGELA: A dead bird should not be in the kitchen! 
ANGELA: A little bit. 
ANGELA: A Purpose Driven Life. 
ANGELA: Absolutely not. 
ANGELA: Agreed. 
ANGELA: Ah! 
ANGELA: Ahh! Dwight! 
ANGELA: All right! 
ANGELA: All right, if I have to be the good wife, I ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I m a better wife than that.  
ANGELA: All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye! 
ANGELA: Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over. 
ANGELA: Allergies. 
ANGELA: Alright, let's go, let's go. 
ANGELA: Alright, see, you don t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It s the wind. Just come and shut  OH! My God! 
ANGELA: Alright. 
ANGELA: Alright. How would you like to celebrate? 
ANGELA: Amen. 
ANGELA: Amen. 
ANGELA: And even if it did, it's just a coincidence. 
ANGELA: And he s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it s Hot Yoga with Blake. 
ANGELA: And I lied to you. 
ANGELA: And I made cookies. Same category. 
ANGELA: And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator? 
ANGELA: And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious. 
ANGELA: And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it? 
ANGELA: And person. 
ANGELA: And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that- 
ANGELA: And they re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone. 
ANGELA: And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods. 
ANGELA: And where do you think you're going? 
ANGELA: And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest. 
ANGELA: Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake... 
ANGELA: Andy, is this you? 
ANGELA: Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together. 
ANGELA: Andy, what are you doing? 
ANGELA: Andy, you want us to buy our own paper? 
ANGELA: Andy. 
ANGELA: Andy? 
ANGELA: Angela.  Michael. 
ANGELA: Another clue, another clue. 
ANGELA: Any problems? 
ANGELA: Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in.  
ANGELA: Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won t forgive. So, hi. 
ANGELA: Apparently. 
ANGELA: Are we out of jobs? 
ANGELA: Are you allowed to have pets? 
ANGELA: Are you authorized to do this? 
ANGELA: Are you drunk? 
ANGELA: Are you drunk? 
ANGELA: Are you enjoying your fiesta? 
ANGELA: Are you going?  
ANGELA: Are you married? 
ANGELA: Are you serious? This is so offensive. 
ANGELA: Are you sure you don t want me to drop him off? 
ANGELA: Are you sure? 
ANGELA: Are you swallowing them whole? You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue? 
ANGELA: Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides! 
ANGELA: At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God. 
ANGELA: Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn t given me a definite yes or no. 
ANGELA: Aw, crap. 
ANGELA: Aw, preemie pajamas! 
ANGELA: Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam? 
ANGELA: Be good. 
ANGELA: Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks. 
ANGELA: Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong. 
ANGELA: Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting? 
ANGELA: Black eye, Meredith. 
ANGELA: Black widow. 
ANGELA: Bless you. 
ANGELA: Bologna? I don't eat bologna. 
ANGELA: Brownies. Cupcakes.  
ANGELA: But-- 
ANGELA: But he's an idiot! 
ANGELA: But I don't see how this is my problem. 
ANGELA: But I don't understand. It's for managers. 
ANGELA: But it's the season of mercy. 
ANGELA: But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom. 
ANGELA: But so far we only have two pictures of him. 
ANGELA: But we don't keep two sets of books. 
ANGELA: But we signed the contract. 
ANGELA: But you said you were in debt.  
ANGELA: But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises? 
ANGELA: But, it... 
ANGELA: But... 
ANGELA: By the end of the day? That's impossible. 
ANGELA: Bye! 
ANGELA: Bye. 
ANGELA: Call him! 
ANGELA: Call him!  
ANGELA: Call him! Call him! 
ANGELA: Can I go back to my desk now? 
ANGELA: Can I please leave? I have a rape flute. 
ANGELA: Can t I just agree without putting my hand in? 
ANGELA: Can we go? I have a lot of work to do. 
ANGELA: Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever? 
ANGELA: Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her? 
ANGELA: Can you arrange a meeting? 
ANGELA: Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine. 
ANGELA: Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go? 
ANGELA: Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves? 
ANGELA: Can you put that down there? 
ANGELA: Can you put that down? 
ANGELA: Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized. 
ANGELA: Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know. 
ANGELA: 'Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business. 
ANGELA: Cecilia....and Phillip. 
ANGELA: Charity. Bake drive. 
ANGELA: Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports. Waste not, want not. 
ANGELA: Charles, where were you born? 
ANGELA: Chocolates? Someone famous? 
ANGELA: Come here, come here. Let's go. 
ANGELA: Come on Clark.  
ANGELA: Come on! 
ANGELA: Come on! 
ANGELA: Come on, Dwight. 
ANGELA: Come on, right now. 
ANGELA: Come on, you're safety partners! 
ANGELA: Come. 
ANGELA: Completely unacceptable. 
ANGELA: Confetti. 
ANGELA: Congratulations Dwight. 
ANGELA: Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning. 
ANGELA: Cool music. 
ANGELA: D, it s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me. 
ANGELA: D? 
ANGELA: Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No. 
ANGELA: Daycare won t take Phillip anymore. 
ANGELA: Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics? 
ANGELA: Decent people everywhere will get offended. 
ANGELA: Did he not tell you that? 
ANGELA: Did Michael give you permission to do this? 
ANGELA: Did Roy ever kill one of your cats? 
ANGELA: Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking? 
ANGELA: Did Toby approve this? 
ANGELA: Did you bring your jerky in again? 
ANGELA: Did you guys figure it out? 
ANGELA: Did you have fun at Benihana's? 
ANGELA: Did you think I stole your baby? 
ANGELA: Did you try the petting zoo? 
ANGELA: Do not panic! 
ANGELA: Do not panic. 
ANGELA: Do they even have a bakery anymore? 
ANGELA: Do you even have a mattress? 
ANGELA: Do you have a gun? 
ANGELA: Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. "Angela..."  "over here, Angela..."  "here. Look here!" 
ANGELA: Do you have any pastries without fruit? 
ANGELA: Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day? 
ANGELA: Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract? 
ANGELA: Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else? 
ANGELA: Do you want to give Michael your urine? 
ANGELA: Don't "Monkey" me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M. 
ANGELA: Don't blame me for something we all forgot. 
ANGELA: Don't encourage him, Dwight. 
ANGELA: Don't go. They eat monkey brains. 
ANGELA: Don't just say things. 
ANGELA: Don't rush me. I'm grieving. 
ANGELA: Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved. 
ANGELA: Don't touch me Dwight!  
ANGELA: Don't you dare tank this.  
ANGELA: Dry. You look like you were having fun. 
ANGELA: Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object.  
ANGELA: Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying. 
ANGELA: Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther. She's coming here this afternoon with her father. Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart!  
ANGELA: Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me. 
ANGELA: Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute. 
ANGELA: Dwight! 
ANGELA: Dwight! 
ANGELA: Dwight! 
ANGELA: Dwight! 
ANGELA: Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight! 
ANGELA: Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight! 
ANGELA: Dwight! That doesn't count! 
ANGELA: Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had. 
ANGELA: Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal. 
ANGELA: Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy. 
ANGELA: Dwight, it s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on. 
ANGELA: Dwight, look at my teeth.  
ANGELA: Dwight, that's awful. 
ANGELA: Dwight, we're fine! Senator 
ANGELA: Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that? 
ANGELA: Dwight, you should be running this office. 
ANGELA: Dwight. 
ANGELA: Dwight. 
ANGELA: Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading. 
ANGELA: Dwight? 
ANGELA: Dwight? 
ANGELA: Dwight? 
ANGELA: Dwight? Senator 
ANGELA: Elevators. 
ANGELA: Email forwards. 
ANGELA: Enough Oscar, enough. 
ANGELA: Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby. 
ANGELA: Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth! 
ANGELA: Everyone put on sunscreen. 
ANGELA: Everything ok?  
ANGELA: Everything. 
ANGELA: Ew! Oh. 
ANGELA: Ew. 
ANGELA: Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband. 
ANGELA: Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you. 
ANGELA: Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house. 
ANGELA: Excuse me? 
ANGELA: Excuse me? 
ANGELA: Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet.   Do your job! 
ANGELA: Extension 128. 
ANGELA: Fifty. 
ANGELA: Fine! It s Oscar. So what? 
ANGELA: Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired! 
ANGELA: Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago. 
ANGELA: Fine. 
ANGELA: Fine. 
ANGELA: Fine. 
ANGELA: Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I m fine with either, but not both.  Listen, you re in this, but you need to wow me, ok? 
ANGELA: For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin. 
ANGELA: Gah. 
ANGELA: Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he? 
ANGELA: Go in single file lines. 
ANGELA: Go, let's go. 
ANGELA: God help you. 
ANGELA: God! 
ANGELA: God! 
ANGELA: God! 
ANGELA: God!  
ANGELA: God! Kevin! 
ANGELA: Go-Go dancers? 
ANGELA: Good afternoon. 
ANGELA: Good evening, Dwight. What is this? 
ANGELA: Good God... 
ANGELA: Good luck, Dwight. 
ANGELA: Good morning. 
ANGELA: Good night, D. 
ANGELA: Good night, Dwight. 
ANGELA: Good point? What is a tub of electricity? 
ANGELA: Good. 
ANGELA: Good. 
ANGELA: Goodbye. 
ANGELA: Goodie. 
ANGELA: Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think? 
ANGELA: Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly. 
ANGELA: Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal. 
ANGELA: Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby. 
ANGELA: Great. 
ANGELA: Guh. 
ANGELA: Has anyone seen the first-aid kit?  How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you. 
ANGELA: Has she done the pageant circuit? 
ANGELA: Have a great day. 
ANGELA: Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you? 
ANGELA: Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue? 
ANGELA: Have you seen this?  
ANGELA: Have you signed the expense reports yet? 
ANGELA: Have you taken any concrete steps? 
ANGELA: He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune. 
ANGELA: He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think that you should go with him. 
ANGELA: He put you right in front of me? Party 
ANGELA: He s always been like that. 
ANGELA: He s here. 
ANGELA: He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady! 
ANGELA: Heh. 
ANGELA: Hello Aunt Shirley. 
ANGELA: Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi! 
ANGELA: Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight? 
ANGELA: Hello, Pam. 
ANGELA: Her name was Sprinkles. 
ANGELA: Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes. 
ANGELA: He's blocking me. 
ANGELA: He's gone. It's just a cupcake now. 
ANGELA: He's hungry. Senator 
ANGELA: He's not weird, he's just individualistic. 
ANGELA: He's out sick. 
ANGELA: Hey D. 
ANGELA: Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton. 
ANGELA: Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up. 
ANGELA: Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee? 
ANGELA: Hey! 
ANGELA: Hey!  Are you sick? 
ANGELA: Hey, come inside and talk to me. 
ANGELA: Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that?  Second 
ANGELA: Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay. 
ANGELA: Hey. 
ANGELA: Hey. 
ANGELA: Hey. Do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man. 
ANGELA: Hey. Senator 
ANGELA: Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here. 
ANGELA: Hey. You wanted to see me? 
ANGELA: Hi, Dwight. 
ANGELA: Hi. 
ANGELA: Hi. 
ANGELA: Hi. 
ANGELA: Hi. 
ANGELA: Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk. 
ANGELA: Hmm, I liked it. 
ANGELA: Hmm. 
ANGELA: Hmm. 
ANGELA: Hmm...  Excuse me. 
ANGELA: Honey! What are you doing here? Senator 
ANGELA: Honey, say something! 
ANGELA: How about, I leave it up? 
ANGELA: How can she make you get back together with her? 
ANGELA: How could you do that without telling me? 
ANGELA: How did you, um, where did you... 
ANGELA: How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary? 
ANGELA: How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business. 
ANGELA: How is that a bad rumor? 
ANGELA: How long does it take to get the results? 
ANGELA: How many gods do you have? 
ANGELA: How thoughtful. 
ANGELA: How tragic. Very sorry to hear that. 
ANGELA: How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions? 
ANGELA: Huh. 
ANGELA: I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny. 
ANGELA: I agree it's unacceptable.  
ANGELA: I already booked a Great Lakes cruise. 
ANGELA: I already did. 
ANGELA: I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman. 
ANGELA: I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas. There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer. 
ANGELA: I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family.   She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive. 
ANGELA: I am sorry he s here today but I had  
ANGELA: I am. 
ANGELA: I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons. These are worthless. 
ANGELA: I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me. 
ANGELA: I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth. 
ANGELA: I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you. 
ANGELA: I called you morons. 
ANGELA: I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car. 
ANGELA: I can play. 
ANGELA: I can't be your monkey, Dwight. 
ANGELA: I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground. 
ANGELA: I can't do it. 
ANGELA: I can't do this. 
ANGELA: I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body. 
ANGELA: I can't, Sprinkles is sick. 
ANGELA: I care! 
ANGELA: I could see enjoying that. 
ANGELA: I did not. Uh-uh. 
ANGELA: I didn't- 
ANGELA: I didn't ask you to do it for me. 
ANGELA: I didn't ask you to scratch it. 
ANGELA: I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day. 
ANGELA: I didn't get mine yet. 
ANGELA: I do like it, actually. 
ANGELA: I do not wanna talk about this. 
ANGELA: I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work. 
ANGELA: I do. 
ANGELA: I don t I don t know why. 
ANGELA: I don t know what you re talking about. 
ANGELA: I don t know. 
ANGELA: I don t like your friend Trevor. 
ANGELA: I don t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something. 
ANGELA: I don't-- 
ANGELA: I don't approve. I don't. 
ANGELA: I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good. 
ANGELA: I don't care, and you won't. 
ANGELA: I don't care, but yes. 
ANGELA: I don't care. 
ANGELA: I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA. 
ANGELA: I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band. 
ANGELA: I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation. 
ANGELA: I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here. 
ANGELA: I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore. 
ANGELA: I don't know. 
ANGELA: I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again. 
ANGELA: I don't like it.  
ANGELA: I don't like my character. 
ANGELA: I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping. 
ANGELA: I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office. 
ANGELA: I don't take any prescription drugs. 
ANGELA: I don't think that this is--- 
ANGELA: I don't think that... 
ANGELA: I don't think that's appropriate. 
ANGELA: I don't understand what you want from me. 
ANGELA: I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles!  
ANGELA: I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo 
ANGELA: I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame. 
ANGELA: I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore. 
ANGELA: I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid. 
ANGELA: I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day. 
ANGELA: I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated. 
ANGELA: I find this incredibly offensive. 
ANGELA: I got sap on me. 
ANGELA: I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor. 
ANGELA: I guess I have. Huh. 
ANGELA: I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys. 
ANGELA: I guess men find Esther attractive. I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing. 
ANGELA: I guess. 
ANGELA: I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer. 
ANGELA: I hate beet salad. 
ANGELA: I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck. 
ANGELA: I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world. 
ANGELA: I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff. 
ANGELA: I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night! 
ANGELA: I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer.. for further regarding your paycheck!  
ANGELA: I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice. And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again. 
ANGELA: I have no information. But I m sure as soon as they know, they ll call you. 
ANGELA: I have one, yes. 
ANGELA: I have some ideas about conservation... 
ANGELA: I have something better than a picture. Come on. 
ANGELA: I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat. 
ANGELA: I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with? 
ANGELA: I have to go clean up after the party. 
ANGELA: I have to hang these. Pizza 
ANGELA: I have to visit the alchy. 
ANGELA: I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting? 
ANGELA: I heard a joke today. 
ANGELA: I heard you.   
ANGELA: I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me. 
ANGELA: I knew it! 
ANGELA: I knew it. You should see their baby. 
ANGELA: I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know. 
ANGELA: I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane. 
ANGELA: I know I haven't made this easy on you.   
ANGELA: I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair. 
ANGELA: I know who this is! 
ANGELA: I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together.  Are you still there? 
ANGELA: I know. 
ANGELA: I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond. 
ANGELA: I know. I'm taking them down. 
ANGELA: I look forward to it. 
ANGELA: I lost it.   
ANGELA: I love you. 
ANGELA: I made a vow. I gave my word. 
ANGELA: I mean, he s gotten worse over the years . 
ANGELA: I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party. 
ANGELA: I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding?  Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford? 
ANGELA: I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour. 
ANGELA: I never felt safe here. 
ANGELA: I normally don't enjoy making people laugh.   
ANGELA: I once reported Oscar to the INS. Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it. 
ANGELA: I only weigh 82 pounds! Uh-- save Bandit!   Oh! 
ANGELA: I said nothing fancy. 
ANGELA: I said you wouldn't be disappointed.  
ANGELA: I said, okay. 
ANGELA: I shredded it. 
ANGELA: I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay. 
ANGELA: I think Andy makes an excellent point. 
ANGELA: I think green is kind of whoreish. 
ANGELA: I think I'd like to go home now. 
ANGELA: I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine.  
ANGELA: I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with. 
ANGELA: I think the senator is having an affair. 
ANGELA: I think the thermostat is acting up again. 
ANGELA: I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight. Senator 
ANGELA: I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk. 
ANGELA: I think we're good. 
ANGELA: I think you have me confused with another person. 
ANGELA: I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way. 
ANGELA: I told you  
ANGELA: I understand. 
ANGELA: I want a butter sculpture of a cat! 
ANGELA: I want eye contact. 
ANGELA: I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave.  
ANGELA: I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me. 
ANGELA: I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok. 
ANGELA: I was. 
ANGELA: I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me? 
ANGELA: I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning.  New Scene 
ANGELA: I will not, it's not- Senator 
ANGELA: I will not. 
ANGELA: I wish some of us still had our shoes on. 
ANGELA: I won't be watching, and I won't. 
ANGELA: I work with Dwight. 
ANGELA: I would like cat. 
ANGELA: I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat. 
ANGELA: I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton! 
ANGELA: I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena. 
ANGELA: I would prefer a public place. See you after work. 
ANGELA: I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code. 
ANGELA: I would very much like that. 
ANGELA: I would watch that. 
ANGELA: I wouldn t know. I never lived with a gay guy. 
ANGELA: I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh. 
ANGELA: I wouldn't put it past her. 
ANGELA: I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator. 
ANGELA: I wrote it out. 
ANGELA: I, barely know him... 
ANGELA: I, I need to get to the paper please.  
ANGELA: If he is your son, that s a great plan. But he s not. He s not your son. 
ANGELA: If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be... 
ANGELA: If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott.   
ANGELA: If you know something Michael... 
ANGELA: If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person. 
ANGELA: I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work  
ANGELA: I'll help you! 
ANGELA: I'll just have some bread. You used your hands. 
ANGELA: I'll take the poster. Some people like these. 
ANGELA: I'm a vegetarian. 
ANGELA: I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat? 
ANGELA: I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting. 
ANGELA: I'm his! His... wife. 
ANGELA: I'm just leaving for the day. 
ANGELA: I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things. 
ANGELA: I'm not dating you. 
ANGELA: I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore. 
ANGELA: I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through. 
ANGELA: I'm not going. You did this, not us. 
ANGELA: I'm not moving the tree. Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell. And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree. 
ANGELA: I'm not some farm animal.  
ANGELA: I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs? 
ANGELA: I'm not voting. 
ANGELA: I'm right here. 
ANGELA: I'm so glad you could come. 
ANGELA: I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone. I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about. Earlier. 
ANGELA: I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor. 
ANGELA: I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could. 
ANGELA: I'm sorry... that you're both morons. 
ANGELA: I'm sure Dwight will protect him. 
ANGELA: I'm sure. 
ANGELA: In mugs with trace amounts of coffee! 
ANGELA: In the Martin family, we like to say, "Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly." That's code for "check out the slut." What is... why are there flies in here? 
ANGELA: In your nose? 
ANGELA: Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin? 
ANGELA: Is it any good? 
ANGELA: Is it called red-vining? 
ANGELA: Is it cool in here to you? 
ANGELA: Is just looks bad. 
ANGELA: Is that all? 
ANGELA: Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you. 
ANGELA: Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy? 
ANGELA: Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights? 
ANGELA: Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles? 
ANGELA: Is this spicy? 
ANGELA: Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence? 
ANGELA: Isn t it amazing, the difference in our sizes? 
ANGELA: It does! 
ANGELA: It doesn't matter, Michael. 
ANGELA: It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them. 
ANGELA: It is awful. You've made this day awful! 
ANGELA: It s just his way of saying,  Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.  
ANGELA: It s the  that lives downstairs. She s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type. 
ANGELA: It s the only thing that will make this right. 
ANGELA: It s too loud. 
ANGELA: It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do. 
ANGELA: It sounds mean. 
ANGELA: It was all my fault. 
ANGELA: It was excellent. 
ANGELA: It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste. 
ANGELA: It was just you... 
ANGELA: It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon.  Dwight, Dwight. 
ANGELA: It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner. 
ANGELA: It would never work here. 
ANGELA: It'll be fun. 
ANGELA: It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose. 
ANGELA: It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter. 
ANGELA: It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd? 
ANGELA: It's a new corporate policy. 
ANGELA: It's after my cat. 
ANGELA: It's alright. 
ANGELA: It's an experiment. 
ANGELA: It's Angela and Oscar. 
ANGELA: It's beautiful. 
ANGELA: It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month.  Michael usually goes with red and white streamers... 
ANGELA: It's fabric! I really wanted this. 
ANGELA: It's fine. 
ANGELA: It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio. 
ANGELA: It's hard. 
ANGELA: It's no worry. 
ANGELA: It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy. 
ANGELA: It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress. 
ANGELA: It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting! 
ANGELA: It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter. 
ANGELA: It's not my problem.   
ANGELA: It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her. 
ANGELA: It's nothing. 
ANGELA: It's ok. 
ANGELA: It's OK. 
ANGELA: It's outside. 
ANGELA: It's really happening! 
ANGELA: It's ridiculous. 
ANGELA: It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him? 
ANGELA: It's so cold. Even with my coat on. 
ANGELA: It's supposed to say launch! 
ANGELA: It's the nativity scene. 
ANGELA: I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it? 
ANGELA: I've already gone up another cup size. The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick? 
ANGELA: I've had the worse day here  
ANGELA: I've noticed how you look at him at the office. 
ANGELA: I've seen some of your spreadsheets. 
ANGELA: Jammed. This day couldn't get worse.  
ANGELA: Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting. 
ANGELA: Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal? 
ANGELA: Jedediah. 
ANGELA: Jedediah. 
ANGELA: Jesus is not your caterer.  But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer?  They don't think. 
ANGELA: Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday. 
ANGELA: Jim. Pam.  And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything.  I wish you both a pleasant day.  And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok. 
ANGELA: Joint custody 
ANGELA: Judges and juries! 
ANGELA: Just a few quick things. 
ANGELA: Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh. 
ANGELA: Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this. 
ANGELA: Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking. 
ANGELA: KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out. 
ANGELA: Kelly's training us? 
ANGELA: Kevin! 
ANGELA: Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! 
ANGELA: Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you? 
ANGELA: Kevin! That's inappropriate. 
ANGELA: Kevin, come. 
ANGELA: Kevin, come. 
ANGELA: Kevin, could you not do that? 
ANGELA: Kevin, Kevin. 
ANGELA: Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project. 
ANGELA: Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more? 
ANGELA: Kevin, what's four plus seven? 
ANGELA: Kevin, where are you going? 
ANGELA: Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top. 
ANGELA: Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it! 
ANGELA: Kevin? 
ANGELA: Last week. 
ANGELA: Let me know. 
ANGELA: Let s go Kelly. 
ANGELA: Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it. 
ANGELA: Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight. 
ANGELA: Little Cici asleep? 
ANGELA: Look, I hate to be "that" person but I just don't like the general spirit of music. 
ANGELA: Look, it s a  Little Pregs   and  Big Pregs   
ANGELA: Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing? 
ANGELA: Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means. 
ANGELA: Love you!  God. 
ANGELA: Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party! What is wrong with you? 
ANGELA: Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10. 
ANGELA: Manure. Get rid of it. 
ANGELA: Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him. 
ANGELA: Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club. 
ANGELA: Maybe. 
ANGELA: Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator. But my new studio apartment is just fine  for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens. 
ANGELA: Meaning what? 
ANGELA: Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you. 
ANGELA: Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry. 
ANGELA: Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead. 
ANGELA: Meredith, too far! 
ANGELA: Meredith's allergic to dairy, so... 
ANGELA: Michael do something about this. 
ANGELA: Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs. 
ANGELA: Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere.  
ANGELA: Michael wrote down "Astird." 
ANGELA: Michael! 
ANGELA: Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy. 
ANGELA: Michael, did you finish yet? 
ANGELA: Michael, do something. 
ANGELA: Michael, I don't like this game. It's scary. 
ANGELA: Michael, there's no way we can do it in time. 
ANGELA: Michael. 
ANGELA: Michael. 
ANGELA: Michael... 
ANGELA: Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day.  
ANGELA: Mmhm. 
ANGELA: Mmhmm. 
ANGELA: Mmhmm. 
ANGELA: Mmhmm. 
ANGELA: Mm-hmm. 
ANGELA: Mm-hmm. 
ANGELA: Mm-Hmm. 
ANGELA: Mm-Hmm. 
ANGELA: Mm-hmm. 
ANGELA: Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together. 
ANGELA: Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery. 
ANGELA: Mmm hmmm. 
ANGELA: Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on. 
ANGELA: Mm-mm 
ANGELA: Murder. 
ANGELA: My baby is not a monster! 
ANGELA: My boyfriend. 
ANGELA: My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district! 
ANGELA: My marriage is in danger. I don t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me. 
ANGELA: My name is Angela. 
ANGELA: My pastor said it can come from breast feeding. 
ANGELA: My Phillip is crawling. 
ANGELA: My place tonight. Wear this.  
ANGELA: My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me. 
ANGELA: Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench. 
ANGELA: Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long. 
ANGELA: Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died.  
ANGELA: Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money. 
ANGELA: Never. Staples 
ANGELA: News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid. 
ANGELA: Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions? 
ANGELA: Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring? 
ANGELA: Nine, eight, five... 
ANGELA: No Dwight! 
ANGELA: No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome. 
ANGELA: No Dwight, I won't-  
ANGELA: No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp. 
ANGELA: No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer. 
ANGELA: No one is more thrilled for them than I am... 
ANGELA: No one said "you must have two" 
ANGELA: No seafood. 
ANGELA: No Star Trek names. 
ANGELA: No thank you, Roy. 
ANGELA: No thank you. 
ANGELA: No thank you. 
ANGELA: No you can't baby!  Good luck. 
ANGELA: No you go. Hi honey! 
ANGELA: No! 
ANGELA: No! 
ANGELA: No! 
ANGELA: No!   
ANGELA: No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight! 
ANGELA: No! God, Mose! God! 
ANGELA: No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker. 
ANGELA: No! No! 
ANGELA: No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating. 
ANGELA: No! Stop it! 
ANGELA: No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted. 
ANGELA: No, don't throw those out! 
ANGELA: No, Dwight! 
ANGELA: No, Dwight. The Senator. 
ANGELA: No, he s fine. 
ANGELA: No, I don t  no. 
ANGELA: No, I meant...  
ANGELA: No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you. 
ANGELA: No, I--I think you should make time for it. Little 
ANGELA: No, I'm not. 
ANGELA: No, it doesn't! 
ANGELA: No, it really seems like something Michael would do. 
ANGELA: No, it wasn t. 
ANGELA: No, it's ah... 
ANGELA: No, it's an invitation. 
ANGELA: No, Kevin, no. 
ANGELA: No, my heels aren't too high. It s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis.  Sorry Phyllis. You didn t know. As long as I can get to the altar. 
ANGELA: No, no! 
ANGELA: No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times. 
ANGELA: No, no, no. 
ANGELA: No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer. 
ANGELA: No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about. 
ANGELA: No, no. I have a fiance I very much like! 
ANGELA: No, none No, stop. It s just  
ANGELA: No, not at all. 
ANGELA: No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside. 
ANGELA: No, not the senator. I love Dwight. 
ANGELA: No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats.   I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh! 
ANGELA: No, orange is whorish. 
ANGELA: No, stop! Just don't. 
ANGELA: No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock. 
ANGELA: No, that s not  
ANGELA: No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness. 
ANGELA: No, the baby. Please, it s my husband s favorite cat. He s broken up about it. It s the only time I ve seen him cry other than our wedding night. 
ANGELA: No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look . He s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants 
ANGELA: No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio. John Mark and John David. 
ANGELA: No, yeah, I think that's a good idea. 
ANGELA: No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover. Senator 
ANGELA: No, you will not. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No. 
ANGELA: No.   
ANGELA: No. Are we supposed to? 
ANGELA: No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable. 
ANGELA: No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats. 
ANGELA: No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day. 
ANGELA: No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these. 
ANGELA: No. I don't want my name attached to this party. 
ANGELA: No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch. 
ANGELA: No. I haven't thought of it. 
ANGELA: No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show. 
ANGELA: No. My doctor wants me to gain weight. 
ANGELA: No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors. 
ANGELA: No. No one wants to see that.   
ANGELA: No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps. 
ANGELA: No. No. 
ANGELA: No. No. 
ANGELA: No. No. 
ANGELA: No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired.  And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations. 
ANGELA: No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs. 
ANGELA: No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves. 
ANGELA: No. This is a closed door meeting. 
ANGELA: No. We heard that about Jim. 
ANGELA: No. You know-no! 
ANGELA: No. You need to sign them all. 
ANGELA: Nobody's named Monday. 
ANGELA: None of them. Especially not Andy. 
ANGELA: Nosy? 
ANGELA: Not here. 
ANGELA: Not now, Kevin. Can t you see we re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks. 
ANGELA: Nothing for me? 
ANGELA: Nothing, Kevin. 
ANGELA: Nothing. Should be fun. 
ANGELA: Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only. 
ANGELA: Now. Come on, up here! 
ANGELA: Obviously. 
ANGELA: Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. Deangelo is a huge sexist. 
ANGELA: Of course. 
ANGELA: Oh geeze. . Oh, my God! 
ANGELA: Oh God! 
ANGELA: Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower? 
ANGELA: Oh God, what did you do? I mean, not that I approve of any of it but... 
ANGELA: Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still. 
ANGELA: Oh my god! 
ANGELA: Oh my god! 
ANGELA: Oh my God!   
ANGELA: Oh my God! Dwight! 
ANGELA: Oh my God! She s so stunningly tiny! She s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they re doing. 
ANGELA: Oh my God. 
ANGELA: Oh my god.  
ANGELA: Oh my God. Jim 
ANGELA: Oh no.  Senator 
ANGELA: Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning! 
ANGELA: Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential. 
ANGELA: Oh! 
ANGELA: Oh!  
ANGELA: Oh!  Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career. 
ANGELA: Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan!  
ANGELA: Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site! 
ANGELA: Oh, Dwight, just move. 
ANGELA: Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD. 
ANGELA: Oh, fine.  
ANGELA: Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come. 
ANGELA: Oh, god, could you just mind your own business? 
ANGELA: Oh, God. 
ANGELA: Oh, God. 
ANGELA: Oh, god. 
ANGELA: Oh, Holly, that is very offensive. 
ANGELA: Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail. 
ANGELA: Oh, I may have seen it somewhere.  Is it this one? 
ANGELA: Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that . 
ANGELA: Oh, it is warm. 
ANGELA: Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up. 
ANGELA: Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin? 
ANGELA: Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame. 
ANGELA: Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky? 
ANGELA: Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'- 
ANGELA: Oh, really? 
ANGELA: Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee. 
ANGELA: Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool. 
ANGELA: Oh, thanks, Oscar. You re such an angel. 
ANGELA: Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide. 
ANGELA: Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again? 
ANGELA: Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends. 
ANGELA: Oh, what is that? 
ANGELA: Oh. 
ANGELA: Oh. 
ANGELA: Oh. 
ANGELA: Oh.  
ANGELA: Oh. Thanks. 
ANGELA: Oh... 
ANGELA: Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here? 
ANGELA: Ohhhh! 
ANGELA: OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field 
ANGELA: Ok, coming. Hi, baby. 
ANGELA: OK, I have one. I have one.  
ANGELA: Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker. 
ANGELA: Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office. 
ANGELA: Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead. 
ANGELA: OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping. 
ANGELA: Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt. 
ANGELA: Ok, you go to the store. 
ANGELA: Ok. 
ANGELA: OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store. 
ANGELA: Okay  
ANGELA: Okay! Everybody! 
ANGELA: Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg. 
ANGELA: Okay, bye. 
ANGELA: Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith. 
ANGELA: Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here. 
ANGELA: Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar. I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim. 
ANGELA: Okay, watch it. 
ANGELA: Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting. 
ANGELA: Okay, yes yes, I will!  I love you! 
ANGELA: Okay. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
ANGELA: Okay. Bye Charles. Well you'll let me know. Good bye. 
ANGELA: Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife? 
ANGELA: Okay. Oh, thank you. 
ANGELA: Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin? What about Pam and Kelly? Also department heads. But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything? 
ANGELA: Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy. 
ANGELA: On it! 
ANGELA: One of the Stamford people is a criminal? 
ANGELA: One thirty.  I'm sorry, are we boring you? 
ANGELA: Ooh! 
ANGELA: Oops. 
ANGELA: Or Mrs. "Outside Hire." 
ANGELA: Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong. 
ANGELA: Oscar! 
ANGELA: Oscar, do you want to be my partner? 
ANGELA: Oscar, don t rub it in. I m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child. 
ANGELA: Oscar, Oscar, will you take him? 
ANGELA: Oscar, use a calculator.  
ANGELA: Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay? 
ANGELA: Oscar. 
ANGELA: Oscar. 
ANGELA: Oscar. 
ANGELA: Oscar...  can I ask you a question? 
ANGELA: Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee? 
ANGELA: Oscar? What is going on? What was that? Senator 
ANGELA: Ow! 
ANGELA: Ow! 
ANGELA: Ow! 
ANGELA: Ow! Dwight! Ow! 
ANGELA: Ow! He pinched me! 
ANGELA: Ow! What are you doing? 
ANGELA: Ow. 
ANGELA: Paid. 
ANGELA: Pam do you think anyone s going to notice I ve worn this costume before? When I wasn t pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits. 
ANGELA: Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend? 
ANGELA: Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis. 
ANGELA: Pam, my bag was there... 
ANGELA: Pam, we have a great idea. 
ANGELA: Pay him whatever he wants. 
ANGELA: People are dressed inappropriately. 
ANGELA: People love it. 
ANGELA: People red vine. 
ANGELA: Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names. This is your boy bowl, with the name "Chevy." And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name "Astird." 
ANGELA: Perfect! 
ANGELA: Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs. 
ANGELA: Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat. 
ANGELA: Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole! 
ANGELA: Phillip s your son. 
ANGELA: Phillip? 
ANGELA: Phyllis wanted red, I didn't. 
ANGELA: Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch. 
ANGELA: Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack. 
ANGELA: Phyllis. These are spoooons. Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top. And we need knives, which have blades. Do you understand me now? 
ANGELA: Phyllis. You're a married woman. 
ANGELA: Phyllis? 
ANGELA: Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak? 
ANGELA: Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still dead. 
ANGELA: Please don t teach the cat French. 
ANGELA: Please just take my name off of everything. 
ANGELA: Please stop making me do these things. 
ANGELA: Please, after the turtle? 
ANGELA: Please. 
ANGELA: Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe. 
ANGELA: Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop! 
ANGELA: Probably. 
ANGELA: Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice. 
ANGELA: Psst. Hey. Erin. 
ANGELA: Pull me up! 
ANGELA: Put your hands in your pockets. 
ANGELA: Rachel, are you all right? 
ANGELA: Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract. 
ANGELA: Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France. 
ANGELA: Really, Pam... 
ANGELA: Really? 
ANGELA: Really? 
ANGELA: Really?  Thank you. 
ANGELA: Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . . 
ANGELA: Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars. 
ANGELA: Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it. 
ANGELA: Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you! 
ANGELA: Really? Well, I hope I do. 
ANGELA: Relax. You'll get your shot at Jim. Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party. 
ANGELA: Right. 
ANGELA: Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone. 
ANGELA: Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock. 
ANGELA: Right? 
ANGELA: Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine. 
ANGELA: Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello. 
ANGELA: Rolph, did you not hear me? 
ANGELA: Rude. 
ANGELA: Safety partners. 
ANGELA: Sales take a long time. 
ANGELA: Same page. Go to the next one. 
ANGELA: See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house. 
ANGELA: Seven thousand dollars. 
ANGELA: Seven, two... 
ANGELA: She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again! 
ANGELA: She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles. 
ANGELA: Shh. 
ANGELA: Shut up! 
ANGELA: Shut up. 
ANGELA: Shut up. 
ANGELA: Side salad, chicken piccata on the side. 
ANGELA: Sign. 
ANGELA: Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight... 
ANGELA: Six-seventy, six-twenty. 
ANGELA: So a child had fallen in? 
ANGELA: So cute. 
ANGELA: So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross? 
ANGELA: So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head? 
ANGELA: So what are your credentials? 
ANGELA: So you fell in? 
ANGELA: So you keep a very tidy house. 
ANGELA: So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you re pregnant? 
ANGELA: So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this. 
ANGELA: So, he's alive. 
ANGELA: So, what happened? 
ANGELA: Some of us got both.  
ANGELA: Someone put them in my bag. 
ANGELA: Something like that. 
ANGELA: Something made of ice? 
ANGELA: Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy. 
ANGELA: Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes. 
ANGELA: Sometimes you talk to us real close. 
ANGELA: Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls. 
ANGELA: Sorry! Bye, Andy! 
ANGELA: Sorry. 
ANGELA: Sounds fun. 
ANGELA: Sparkling cider is very good. 
ANGELA: Spray her down? 
ANGELA: Spring cleaning? 
ANGELA: Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish. 
ANGELA: Sprinkles. 
ANGELA: Standard, you know? Nothing fancy. 
ANGELA: Stop it Kevin! 
ANGELA: Stop it! 
ANGELA: Stop it! Gimme that! Give it! 
ANGELA: Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me! 
ANGELA: Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed. 
ANGELA: Stop it. 
ANGELA: Stop it. 
ANGELA: Stop it. 
ANGELA: Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it. 
ANGELA: Stop! 
ANGELA: Stop... 
ANGELA: Such a precious little angel. 
ANGELA: Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented. 
ANGELA: Sure. 
ANGELA: Sure. 
ANGELA: Sure. 
ANGELA: Sure.  Watch the head, watch the head. 
ANGELA: Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that. 
ANGELA: Take this thing.   
ANGELA: Thank you, Michael. 
ANGELA: Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey.  Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank You. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you.  
ANGELA: Thank you.  
ANGELA: Thank you.  I... I don't want those. 
ANGELA: Thank you.  Oh god! 
ANGELA: Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left! 
ANGELA: Thank you. Sure well first of all I think that we could totally... 
ANGELA: Thanks again, Charles. 
ANGELA: Thanks. 
ANGELA: Thanks. 
ANGELA: Thanks.  Oh. Ouch. 
ANGELA: That didn't happen. 
ANGELA: That doesn't sound like me. 
ANGELA: That doesn't surprise me. 
ANGELA: That is a terrible idea. One of your worst. 
ANGELA: That is completely untrue. 
ANGELA: That is so unnecessary! 
ANGELA: That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it.   
ANGELA: That is where we disagree. 
ANGELA: That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can. 
ANGELA: That town is full of history! 
ANGELA: That was for per diem, for Philadelphia. 
ANGELA: That was interesting.  What was that? 
ANGELA: That was more horrifying than Nunsense. 
ANGELA: That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy. 
ANGELA: That's enough. 
ANGELA: That's never the case. 
ANGELA: That's not happening. 
ANGELA: That's Phyllis. 
ANGELA: That's why we're cursed. 
ANGELA: That's why you're not in charge Meredith. 
ANGELA: That's your toast? 
ANGELA: That's... no... 
ANGELA: The Bible. 
ANGELA: The DaVinci Code! 
ANGELA: The dream team... and Meredith. 
ANGELA: The glitter is blinding. 
ANGELA: The guys? 
ANGELA: The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat. 
ANGELA: The party starts in an hour. 
ANGELA: The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next.  
ANGELA: The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata. 
ANGELA: The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out. 
ANGELA: The senator will be joining us later. 
ANGELA: The senator. 
ANGELA: The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit. 
ANGELA: The very best of luck to you, Dwight. 
ANGELA: The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab. 
ANGELA: Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide.  
ANGELA: Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party? 
ANGELA: Then roll an eight. 
ANGELA: Then what'd he do?  
ANGELA: There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over. 
ANGELA: There should be some .. 
ANGELA: There was much more secret filming than I expected.  But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am. 
ANGELA: There. 
ANGELA: There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail. 
ANGELA: There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques. 
ANGELA: There's still an hour. 
ANGELA: These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas." I think you should leave. 
ANGELA: These are for employees only. 
ANGELA: These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car. 
ANGELA: They arrived this morning. 
ANGELA: They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed.  They use a watch repair kit. 
ANGELA: They lost me when they sang  Monster Mash . That song obviously glorifies the occult. 
ANGELA: They re sleeping with my husband. 
ANGELA: This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot. 
ANGELA: This is a big day for you. 
ANGELA: This is a cold pack... 
ANGELA: This is all pathetic. 
ANGELA: This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book. 
ANGELA: This is from Hooters. 
ANGELA: This is how you make this important decision? 
ANGELA: This is illegal. 
ANGELA: This is just offensive. 
ANGELA: This is my big sister Rachel. 
ANGELA: This is my favorite day. 
ANGELA: This is not work talk. 
ANGELA: This is Sprinkles.  She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year,  just a couple of kittens  out on the town. 
ANGELA: This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse. 
ANGELA: This looks like a hoot. 
ANGELA: This should've been up yesterday.  
ANGELA: This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel. 
ANGELA: Those aren't chips and dip. 
ANGELA: Those aren't helpful. 
ANGELA: Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy. 
ANGELA: Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six... 
ANGELA: To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us. 
ANGELA: Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective. 
ANGELA: Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work? 
ANGELA: Try harder then.  Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some. 
ANGELA: Two hundred dollars. 
ANGELA: Two sacks  worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house. 
ANGELA: Two, one... 
ANGELA: Ugh! 
ANGELA: Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll- 
ANGELA: Ugh. 
ANGELA: Ugh. 
ANGELA: Ugh. 
ANGELA: Ugh. 
ANGELA: Ugh. 
ANGELA: Ugh. 
ANGELA: Ugh. Eww! 
ANGELA: Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin. 
ANGELA: Uh! 
ANGELA: Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing? Senator 
ANGELA: Uh-huh. 
ANGELA: Uh-huh. 
ANGELA: Uh-huh. 
ANGELA: Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time. 
ANGELA: Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading. 
ANGELA: Uh-uh, leave us alone. Senator 
ANGELA: Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller. 
ANGELA: Um, you have diabetes, Stanley.  I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity? 
ANGELA: Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice. 
ANGELA: Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office. 
ANGELA: Very much. How's your meat? 
ANGELA: Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps. I'm not comfortable with this.  
ANGELA: Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem! Senator 
ANGELA: Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed? 
ANGELA: Wait, what is this? 
ANGELA: Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can t get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on fire -- 
ANGELA: Want me to say it again? 
ANGELA: Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed. 
ANGELA: Waste of time. 
ANGELA: Waste of time. The website's going to win. 
ANGELA: Watching some of your friends. 
ANGELA: We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity? 
ANGELA: We are not married. 
ANGELA: We both-you didn't dup- 
ANGELA: We can make a difference here. 
ANGELA: We can save that. 
ANGELA: We can talk right here. 
ANGELA: We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible. 
ANGELA: We get it. 
ANGELA: We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby. 
ANGELA: We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit. 
ANGELA: We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape? 
ANGELA: We really have a lot of work to do right now. 
ANGELA: We think you might kill Robert. 
ANGELA: We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife. 
ANGELA: We will discuss this later. 
ANGELA: Welcome back. 
ANGELA: Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed. 
ANGELA: Well  
ANGELA: Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you. 
ANGELA: We'll see. 
ANGELA: Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out. 
ANGELA: Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster. 
ANGELA: Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it? 
ANGELA: Well, for our profit... 
ANGELA: Well, he didn t fight me hard on it. 
ANGELA: Well, I have an alternative. 
ANGELA: Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department... 
ANGELA: Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption. 
ANGELA: Well, I only ask because he's a senator. 
ANGELA: Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy. 
ANGELA: Well, I ve changed my mind. 
ANGELA: Well, I won't tell if you don't. 
ANGELA: Well, it better work. 
ANGELA: Well, it does. That's me. 
ANGELA: Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us. 
ANGELA: Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about- 
ANGELA: Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it. 
ANGELA: Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead. 
ANGELA: Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate? 
ANGELA: Well, this is intimate. 
ANGELA: Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I m having. 
ANGELA: Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it. 
ANGELA: Well, when you have coffee breath- 
ANGELA: Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead? 
ANGELA: Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent? 
ANGELA: Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding. 
ANGELA: Well, you might be right. But it s too late now. 
ANGELA: Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers. 
ANGELA: We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick. 
ANGELA: We're in the pool! 
ANGELA: Were you? 
ANGELA: Wha - 
ANGELA: Wha? Who gave you that advice? 
ANGELA: Whack. 
ANGELA: What a surprise. 
ANGELA: What about me?  Klokken tre pige  
ANGELA: What about my cherub figurine? 
ANGELA: What about the surprise? 
ANGELA: What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs? 
ANGELA: What am I supposed to do with this? 
ANGELA: What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?' 
ANGELA: What are--- it's... the party planning committee. 
ANGELA: What are you--   What are you doing? 
ANGELA: What are you doing here? 
ANGELA: What are you doing? 
ANGELA: What are you doing? 
ANGELA: What are you doing? 
ANGELA: What are you talking about Michael? 
ANGELA: What color do you guys think? 
ANGELA: What did you do to yourself?  
ANGELA: What do we do about our heads? 
ANGELA: What do you Dwight!  
ANGELA: What do you hear? 
ANGELA: What do you mean by  poisoned ? 
ANGELA: What do you mean? 
ANGELA: What do you want? 
ANGELA: What does that mean? 
ANGELA: What does that mean? 
ANGELA: What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story. 
ANGELA: What have you heard? 
ANGELA: What if it's a girl? 
ANGELA: What if they deserved it? 
ANGELA: What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet? 
ANGELA: What is it? 
ANGELA: What is so funny? 
ANGELA: What is that? 
ANGELA: What is that? What is that? 
ANGELA: What is this? 
ANGELA: What is this? 
ANGELA: What is wrong with you?  
ANGELA: What s going on? 
ANGELA: What the  is your problem you   ?! 
ANGELA: What the hell is happening? 
ANGELA: What!? 
ANGELA: What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them? 
ANGELA: What, Pam? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What? 
ANGELA: What?  Okay. 
ANGELA: What? Kevin! 
ANGELA: What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people. 
ANGELA: What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich? 
ANGELA: What? What is it? 
ANGELA: What? Why did you call me out here? 
ANGELA: What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that?  Oh! I didn't know they were filming then! 
ANGELA: When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile. 
ANGELA: When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds. 
ANGELA: Where have you been?! I've been waiting. 
ANGELA: Where is it? 
ANGELA: Where? 
ANGELA: Where's Dwight? Second 
ANGELA: Where's my car? Come on. 
ANGELA: Which one is the instructor? There all fatties. 
ANGELA: Who drives like that? 
ANGELA: Whoo! 
ANGELA: Why didn t you pack the apple snacks? 
ANGELA: Why do you want this cat? 
ANGELA: Why don t you pack it? 
ANGELA: Why isn't Jim wet? 
ANGELA: Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion? 
ANGELA: Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood? 
ANGELA: Why? 
ANGELA: Why? 
ANGELA: Why? 
ANGELA: Why'd you stop it? 
ANGELA: Will you help me put it over there? 
ANGELA: Will you lock the door? 
ANGELA: Will you marry me? 
ANGELA: With who? 
ANGELA: Would you like to hold Phillip?  Yeah. That s Kevin. 
ANGELA: Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight 
ANGELA: Yeah! 
ANGELA: Yeah! 
ANGELA: Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that. 
ANGELA: Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes. 
ANGELA: Yeah, I can see that. 
ANGELA: Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun. 
ANGELA: Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place.  Don't laugh at me. 
ANGELA: Yeah, it is. So I hope you two are very happy together. Pervert. 
ANGELA: Yeah, neither did I. 
ANGELA: Yeah, okay. That s not what I mean. You don t have to leave because you said you would. Don t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It s not worth it. 
ANGELA: Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam? 
ANGELA: Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid. 
ANGELA: Yeah, that's a good one. 
ANGELA: Yeah, uh no. 
ANGELA: Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form. 
ANGELA: Yeah. 
ANGELA: Yeah. 
ANGELA: Yeah. 
ANGELA: Yeah. 
ANGELA: Yeah. 
ANGELA: Yeah. 
ANGELA: Yeah.  
ANGELA: Yeah.   I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year. 
ANGELA: Yeah. And I said sorry. 
ANGELA: Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it. 
ANGELA: Yes it does! 
ANGELA: Yes it is. 
ANGELA: Yes! 
ANGELA: Yes! 
ANGELA: Yes! 
ANGELA: yes! 
ANGELA: Yes!  Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here! 
ANGELA: Yes, a knee-capping could work. 
ANGELA: Yes, he is. 
ANGELA: Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day. 
ANGELA: Yes, it is.  Hello? 
ANGELA: Yes, it was. 
ANGELA: Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim.  Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me?  
ANGELA: Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000. 
ANGELA: Yes, that's the problem. 
ANGELA: Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays.  
ANGELA: Yes, What are you doing here? 
ANGELA: Yes, yes. He's sleeping. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. And he didn t like it. 
ANGELA: Yes. Congratulations. 
ANGELA: Yes. Don't forget the pipe. 
ANGELA: Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath? 
ANGELA: Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember? 
ANGELA: Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em! 
ANGELA: Yes...  but don't expect any cookie. 
ANGELA: Yes? 
ANGELA: You alone? Because I thought together we could--- 
ANGELA: You already did me. 
ANGELA: You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them. 
ANGELA: You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun? 
ANGELA: You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court. 
ANGELA: You are throwing up for the wrong reasons! 
ANGELA: You are. You make your own drink.  
ANGELA: You can't go in yet! 
ANGELA: You can't have it  I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack. 
ANGELA: You deserved every bit of it! You made my husband gay. 
ANGELA: You did kill her!? 
ANGELA: You don t carry it with you? 
ANGELA: You don t want me at your place. 
ANGELA: You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though. Delivery 
ANGELA: You don't know them all? 
ANGELA: You don't understand. 
ANGELA: You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up? 
ANGELA: You embarrassed me earlier. 
ANGELA: You gave birth in a tub? 
ANGELA: You got it. 
ANGELA: You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization. 
ANGELA: You have to use chains? 
ANGELA: You know I was thinking... 
ANGELA: You know she has it out for him now. 
ANGELA: You know what Pam just save it. 
ANGELA: You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early. 
ANGELA: You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis! Senator 
ANGELA: You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night. 
ANGELA: You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities . 
ANGELA: You know, there s doughnuts in the break room. 
ANGELA: You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic. 
ANGELA: You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero. 
ANGELA: You never told us to close them. 
ANGELA: You never... you don't like them. 
ANGELA: You play that. 
ANGELA: You put her in my freezer. 
ANGELA: You re a dad! 
ANGELA: You said you would be there for me. 
ANGELA: You saw it? Describe it please. 
ANGELA: You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right? 
ANGELA: You shouldn't joke about that. 
ANGELA: You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it. 
ANGELA: You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on.  Please.  Thank you. OK, thank you very much.  
ANGELA: You two are apes. 
ANGELA: You wanna see some pictures? I just got these. 
ANGELA: You were supposed to be my friend. 
ANGELA: You won't see- 
ANGELA: You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you? 
ANGELA: You!  
ANGELA: You'll see me in small claims court! 
ANGELA: Your hand's in it. 
ANGELA: Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer. 
ANGELA: You're a freak! 
ANGELA: You're ahead. 
ANGELA: You're bad at this too! 
ANGELA: You're expanding on your worst idea. 
ANGELA: You're gonna wait here? 
ANGELA: You're in my way! 
ANGELA: You're not going to get my permission on this. 
ANGELA: You're safety partners! 
ANGELA: You're useless. 
ANGELA: You're welcome. Would you like some stew?

ANOTHER: "Hey um, you're poor." "Well hey, you're mama's dead." That's what friends do. It's... you're so white. 
ANSWER: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking.  Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of.

BRANDON:  So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant? 
BRANDON: At midnight? 
BRANDON: Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good? 
BRANDON: Don't play dumb with me. I know what's up. 
BRANDON: Hope you all like goat. 
BRANDON: How you doing, Val?  
BRANDON: I read the text you sent to Val, man. 
BRANDON: Must be doing real good since you're f***ing my girlfriend. 
BRANDON: No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn't find anything, but I did, so- 
BRANDON: Oh no, I'm not actually Jamaican. 
BRANDON: Oh, and have a burger for me. Senator 
BRANDON: See? Yes. Thank you, sister. 
BRANDON: Sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend. 
BRANDON: Thank you, Biggie. 
BRANDON: That's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that. 
BRANDON: With the dots. 
BRANDON: You forgot one. 
BRANDON: You would? 
BREAKROOM:  
BREASTS: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested. 
BRENDA: Really? What? 
BRENDA: When are you going to start the presentation? 
BRENDA: Yeah. Everybody's really nice. 
BRENT:  Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear you're looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they don't see things your way? Then I ain't that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? You've changed your mind? You're now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too.  When do I start? Yeah.  
BRENT: Oh, sorry, mate. 
BRIAN:  Easy!  
BRIAN: Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up. 
BRIAN: Alright, that's for you.  
BRIAN: At least my crying won't get you fired. 
BRIAN: Cheers. 
BRIAN: Give her a minute. Give her a minute. 
BRIAN: Hey, hey, hey!  
BRIAN: Hey, it s just a tough situation, all right? 
BRIAN: Hey, you okay? 
BRIAN: Hey. 
BRIAN: Hi.  
BRIAN: It s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you.  
BRIAN: It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that. 
BRIAN: It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available. 
BRIAN: It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming. 
BRIAN: Let me grab a couple drinks. 
BRIAN: Look, if you give me a chance I can, I-  Pam. 
BRIAN: Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you. 
BRIAN: No no, it's- 
BRIAN: No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this- 
BRIAN: No, you're not crazy. 
BRIAN: No. No, it's... 
BRIAN: No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too. 
BRIAN: Nothing. You re doing the best you can. 
BRIAN: Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better. 
BRIAN: Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment. 
BRIAN: Oh yeah, that's right. 
BRIAN: Oh, hey Meredith. 
BRIAN: Oh, hey! 
BRIAN: Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread. 
BRIAN: Pretty much everything. 
BRIAN: Seeya. 
BRIAN: So... 
BRIAN: Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away? 
BRIAN: Sure. 
BRIAN: That's not really true, I mean- 
BRIAN: That's... OK, great. Does he pay well? 
BRIAN: They want to know how much what? 
BRIAN: They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you. 
BRIAN: Uh, listen, they re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna  I, I ll see you later. 
BRIAN: Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today. 
BRIAN: Um... 
BRIAN: We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb. 
BRIAN: What brings you by? 
BRIAN: Will do. 
BRIAN: Yeah, hold on a sec. 
BRIAN: Yeah, it is. 
BRIAN: Yeah, it was cool. 
BRIAN: Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this.  Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there. 
BRIAN: Yeah. 
BRIAN: Yeah. Let s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough. 
BRIAN: Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over.  I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK.  We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other. 
BRIAN: You're gonna hit a woman? 
BRONTE:  Did, uh, you just interview? 
BROWN: Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission? 
BROWN: Don't worry about dating. 
BROWN: Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember? 
BROWN: Great. We're all set. 
BROWN: Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening. 
BROWN: I can't leave until you do. 
BROWN: Michael, can I talk to you candidly? 
BROWN: Mr. Brown. 
BROWN: No. With more ignorance. 
BROWN: Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge. 
BROWN: Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness. 
BROWN: Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you? 
BROWN: Oh, I'm all set, thanks. 
BROWN: Ok, you're thinking of a superhero. 
BROWN: OK. 
BROWN: OK. Thank you. 
BROWN: Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity. 
BROWN: Right. OK. 
BROWN: So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome. 
BROWN: Stop it! 
BROWN: Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated. 
BROWN: Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out. 
BROWN: Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance. 
BROWN: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great. 
BROWN: That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance. 
BROWN: Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed. 
BROWN: Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind. 
BROWN: Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature. 
BROWN: Um... 
BROWN: Wait a second. 
BROWN: We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made. 
BROWN: Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK. 
BROWN: Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment. 
BROWN: Well, we only have an hour. 
BROWN: Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need. 
BROWN: Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that... 
BRUCE: Made it. 
BUFFALO:   What is he talking about? 
BUFFALO:   You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it.   
BUFFALO: And? 
BUFFALO: Are we losing our jobs or not, David? 
BUFFALO: David, is this true? 
BUFFETT: Can you do any better on salary? 
BUSINESS: accept. 
BUSINESS: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded. 
BUSINESS: make Andrew Bernard my number two. 
BUSINESS: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel. 
BUYER: Okay. We ll take it. 
BUYER: Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past. 
BUYER: We wanna buy your house. 
BUYER: Yep. 
CALIFORNIA:  Bravo, Dwight! Very good!   Shame. 
CALIFORNIA: And yet Todd, it's you who's fired. Todd 
CALIFORNIA: But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim?  They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us. 
CALIFORNIA: I am loving the chemistry between you two. 
CALIFORNIA: I bet. I'm excited. 
CALIFORNIA: I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight. 
CALIFORNIA: I don't see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible. 
CALIFORNIA: If I may,  try holding the putter... yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here. 
CALIFORNIA: I'll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day. 
CALIFORNIA: I'm gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board. 
CALIFORNIA: That was never on the table. Todd 
CALIFORNIA: That's right. Your little finger. 
CALIFORNIA: Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers. 
CALIFORNIA: What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea,  which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution. Todd 
CALIFORNIA: You don't work in sales, do you. 
CALVIN: Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no? 
CALVIN: I wouldn't. 
CALVIN: They did not. 
CAMERAMAN: Brian. 
CAMERON:  Are we gonna eat these today? 
CAMERON:  Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them? 
CAMERON:  That's a cow? 
CAMERON:  What are you doing now? 
CAMERON: I don't know any of that. 
CAMERON: I don't know. 
CAMERON: I never met him. 
CAMERON: I was just asking you something I didn't know. 
CAMERON: Is that a guillotine? 
CARLA: Are you okay, sir? 
CARLA: Can you drive a car? 
CARLA: Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap? 
CARLA: Oh, trying to sleep. 
CARLA: So, what can you do? 
CARLA: Uh, no. We re we re gonna take you on as a client. 
CARLA: We are extremely excited to be working with you too, sir. Pay Todd on your way out. 
CARLA: Well, Mr. Bernard, I m gonna be honest with you. 
CARLA: Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45? 
CARLA: Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kid s party, let  em throw pies at ya? 
CAROL:  Can we talk about this in private? 
CAROL:  Hello, Michael? 
CAROL:  I m so sorry. They were an hour late. 
CAROL:  I thought you said this was a costume party! 
CAROL:  What? 
CAROL: Actually yes. 
CAROL: All right. 
CAROL: An Indian woman in a sari. 
CAROL: And I'll bring the papers, too. 
CAROL: And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow. 
CAROL: Are we ready to sign some papers? 
CAROL: Are you okay? 
CAROL: But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing . And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us. 
CAROL: Bye. 
CAROL: Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive. 
CAROL: Can we talk about this in private? 
CAROL: Drink would be good. 
CAROL: Get outta here. 
CAROL: Goodbye. 
CAROL: Hi, hi. 
CAROL: Hi, is Michael around here? 
CAROL: Hi. 
CAROL: Hi. 
CAROL: I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right? 
CAROL: I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem. 
CAROL: I know.  
CAROL: I really need a moment alone with you.  
CAROL: I think you're a really sweet guy. 
CAROL: I went on a ski trip. 
CAROL: I'd love to go. 
CAROL: I'll see you tonight. 
CAROL: I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance. 
CAROL: I'm sorry. 
CAROL: Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom. 
CAROL: It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood. 
CAROL: Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association. 
CAROL: Michael, this is the unit you saw and... 
CAROL: Michael. 
CAROL: Michael. 
CAROL: Michael... 
CAROL: Michael? 
CAROL: No just the front two. 
CAROL: No problemo. 
CAROL: No, I'm good. 
CAROL: No. See, we never went on a ski trip. 
CAROL: Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later? 
CAROL: Oh, great. 
CAROL: Oh, great. 
CAROL: Oh, Michael. 
CAROL: Oh, no. Michael. 
CAROL: Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess. 
CAROL: Okay, good night, Michael. 
CAROL: Okay. 
CAROL: She seems really nice. 
CAROL: Sure. 
CAROL: Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total. 
CAROL: Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here. 
CAROL: That's some extra income for you. 
CAROL: They're not s'mores. They're samosas. 
CAROL: This is so weird. 
CAROL: This is the ninth date, Michael. 
CAROL: To answer your question... 
CAROL: To the casino thing? 
CAROL: Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband. 
CAROL: Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson. 
CAROL: Well, I'm having a nice time. 
CAROL: Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total. 
CAROL: What are you talking about? 
CAROL: What does that mean? 
CAROL: What is this?  
CAROL: What? 
CAROL: What? 
CAROL: What? Too spicy? 
CAROL: Whenever you're ready, Michael. 
CAROL: Whenever you're ready. 
CAROL: Who told you that? 
CAROL: Wow, bad luck. 
CAROL: Yes. 
CAROL: You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now. 
CAROL: You, too. 
CARROL: Well so do I, but we didn't love each other at first either. I don't know what you were thinking! 
CARROLL: Because the receptionist told me a man called but he only said he was my ex-lover. 
CARROLL: Did the doctor check it out? 
CARROLL: I'm great! How are you? 
CARROLL: It's a family room. 
CARROLL: Michael why are you here? 
CARROLL: Michael. 
CARROLL: No. 
CARROLL: Oh! Oh, that's what you're talking about? 
CARROLL: So this is the chef's kitchen, which makes it perfect for real entertainers. 
CARROLL: What? Did you have that while we were together? 
CARROLL: Yeah. 
CARROLL: Yes, yes Michael. Actually you do make a bigger deal out of things than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date. 
CARROLL: You didn't call my office and ask where I was? 
CARROLL: You know, we all do that. 
CASEY:  Casey Dean! 
CASEY: Ah! It s Mark McGrath! Oh my god! You re gorgeous! Mark 
CASEY: America wants it! 
CASEY: Big time.

CASEY: You re back! 
CATCHPHRASE: "My horn can pierce the sky". Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks. And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit. Isn't that right princess?   
CATHY:  
CATHY:

CATHY: I don't know. He's not picking up. Todd 
CATHY: I haven't seen anything. 
CATHY: I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me? 
CATHY: I think everything is under control. 
CATHY: Is this really nessecary? 
CATHY: It was from a deleted scene so we were both right. 
CATHY: It's almost too warm.

CATHY: Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea. 
CATHY: Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or- 
CATHY: Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one. 
CATHY: Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter. 
CATHY: Well, that's how I played it in college. 
CATHY: What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right? 
CATHY: Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster  Okay, cool. Thanks  I know, I'm a pig, right?

CHARLES: And what is that? 
CHARLES: Any responsibilities come with it? 
CHARLES: As soon as possible. 
CHARLES: Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.

CHARLES: Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me. 
CHARLES: How about I just say hi to everyone at one time? 
CHARLES: How old are you? 
CHARLES: I agree. 
CHARLES: I am aware of the effect I have on woman. 
CHARLES: I can't pretend I haven't seen that. So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk out. And you can't take anything. 
CHARLES: I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office. 
CHARLES: I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning. 
CHARLES: I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over. 
CHARLES: I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault- 
CHARLES: I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken. 
CHARLES: I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David? 
CHARLES: I don't want to hear excuses. I want to see improvements. This is unacceptable. 
CHARLES: I feel like I should be thanking you. 
CHARLES: I guess that's it for you, Jim. 
CHARLES: I know. Yes I do. 
CHARLES: I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals. 
CHARLES: I will walk away. 
CHARLES: I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh-- 
CHARLES: I-I was- 
CHARLES: I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way. 
CHARLES: In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott. 
CHARLES: Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office. 
CHARLES: Is this something you really want to have said? 
CHARLES: It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending. 
CHARLES: It's no big deal. 
CHARLES: I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed. 
CHARLES: Jim. 
CHARLES: Jim. Pam. 
CHARLES: Jim. What do you play? 
CHARLES: Just get it right. 
CHARLES: Just keep it simple. 
CHARLES: Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns.   Yeah. 
CHARLES: Let's see what you got in those legs! 
CHARLES: Look who just woke up!   I've been up for a while. 
CHARLES: Looking good. 
CHARLES: Michael get up! 
CHARLES: Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand? 
CHARLES: Michael, I'm going to stay for the day. 
CHARLES: Michael, no, let's be cool, ok? 
CHARLES: Michael, what are you doing? 
CHARLES: Michael, you're back. 
CHARLES: Miner -   
CHARLES: Mmmhmm. 
CHARLES: Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest.   
CHARLES: Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit.   Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately? 
CHARLES: Nice day, huh? 
CHARLES: No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel. 
CHARLES: No, it is not. 
CHARLES: No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok? 
CHARLES: No, Jim... I think you should go. 
CHARLES: No, Mich-Michael. 
CHARLES: No, no no no. You're done, Michael. 
CHARLES: No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties. 
CHARLES: No, seriously. 
CHARLES: No, they were your client. They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company. 
CHARLES: No. 
CHARLES: No. 
CHARLES: No. 
CHARLES: No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear "yes". 
CHARLES: not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank... 
CHARLES: Number two? 
CHARLES: Oh yeah, take your time. Stanley, pay attention. 
CHARLES: Oh yeah? 
CHARLES: Oh, and Kelly... 
CHARLES: Oh, I didn't know that position existed. 
CHARLES: Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly.   
CHARLES: Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health. 
CHARLES: Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the? 
CHARLES: Oh, okay. 
CHARLES: Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today. 
CHARLES: Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry. 
CHARLES: Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad. Hasn't been that bad. These people are the salt of the earth down here. You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company. 
CHARLES: Oh. 
CHARLES: Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee. 
CHARLES: Ok, Michael, what are you doing? 
CHARLES: Ok, so we're on the same page, great. 
CHARLES: Ok. 
CHARLES: Ok. 
CHARLES: Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. 
CHARLES: Okay, do not go anywhere near the conference room. 
CHARLES: Okay, great. 
CHARLES: Okay, great. Uh, Dwight come on in. Also, Jim. 
CHARLES: Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon. 
CHARLES: Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front. 
CHARLES: Okay, let me know if you find it. 
CHARLES: Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys?   Thank you. So, umm... 
CHARLES: Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week? 
CHARLES: Okay, Michael? 
CHARLES: Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming? 
CHARLES: Okay. 
CHARLES: Okay. 
CHARLES: Okay. 
CHARLES: Okay. After you. 
CHARLES: Okay. Hey, Dwight. Can I talk to you? 
CHARLES: Okay. See you on the field, there, bro. 
CHARLES: Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay? 
CHARLES: Right. 
CHARLES: Right. I mean why work harder than you should. 
CHARLES: Saticoy Steel. 
CHARLES: See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait! 
CHARLES: So how long can they stay viable? 
CHARLES: So you keep this made up position? It's important to you? 
CHARLES: So you're the assistant to the regional manager? 
CHARLES: So, we had a personnel change today. Shouldn't effect our day to day. But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones. 
CHARLES: Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week. 
CHARLES: Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels. 
CHARLES: Thank you. 
CHARLES: That's a great idea, Dwight. 
CHARLES: That's great. 
CHARLES: That's not how I plan on doing things. 
CHARLES: That's not the way it's gonna work. 
CHARLES: That's very kind of you to say, David. 
CHARLES: The conference room is ready if we want to get started. 
CHARLES: There he is. There he is. How was the trip up? 
CHARLES: They don't make them anymore. 
CHARLES: This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time. 
CHARLES: This isn't a good use of company time, Michael. 
CHARLES: Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that. 
CHARLES: Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data. 
CHARLES: Uh, Jim hold on.   You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy. Okay? 
CHARLES: Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours. 
CHARLES: Uh, well said, Angela. 
CHARLES: Uh. 
CHARLES: Um. 
CHARLES: We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info. 
CHARLES: We still have the inventory sitting--   
CHARLES: Well, it's not for everybody I suppose.   
CHARLES: Well, that makes two of us. 
CHARLES: What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game? 
CHARLES: what are you doing? 
CHARLES: What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?

CHARLES: Why'd you duck, Jim? 
CHARLES: Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at. 
CHARLES: Yeah I know. 
CHARLES: Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager. 
CHARLES: Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot. 
CHARLES: Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused. 
CHARLES: Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man. 
CHARLES: Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity. 
CHARLES: Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay? I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good. Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay?   
CHARLES: Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week- 
CHARLES: Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott. 
CHARLES: Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay? 
CHARLES: Yeah, Jim--

CHARLES: Yeah. 
CHARLES: Yeah. 
CHARLES: Yeah. 
CHARLES: Yeah? 
CHARLES: Yep. Yep. That's Pele. 
CHARLES: Yes we are! 
CHARLES: Yes. 
CHARLES: Yes. Yes, I was gonna say the same thing. We should buy him out. 
CHARLES: You a soccer fan? 
CHARLES: You didn't tell them. 
CHARLES: You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history. 
CHARLES: You know, you can run this stuff by Toby. 
CHARLES: You started on that rundown yet?   
CHARLES: You still have that option.   
CHARLES: You two are morons. 
CHARLES: Your name is Jim? 
CHARLES: You're working hard? On this? 
CHEF: Actually, the Usuba's the better knife when you're working with this quantity. 
CHEF: No, it's Usuba. 
CHELSEA:  Are you Lincoln? 
CHET: I want to be on TV! 
CHET: My name's Chet. Edward R.

CHILD: I don't know. 
CHILDREN:  Trick or treat! 
CHRISTIAN:  I want my baby back, baby back, baby back- 
CHRISTIAN: I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they're expecting me to make cuts. 
CHRISTIAN: I have time. 
CHRISTIAN: I know. 
CHRISTIAN: It's not fair. 
CHRISTIAN: It's ok, I like jokes. 
CHRISTIAN: It's terrible. 
CHRISTIAN: No, not long. 
CHRISTIAN: No. 
CHRISTIAN: Ohhh no!  Oh my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose! 
CHRISTIAN: Right down the street? 
CHRISTIAN: Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction- 
CHRISTIAN: So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her. 
CHRISTIAN: Sure. 
CHRISTIAN: Thank you. 
CHRISTIAN: That's right. 
CHRISTIAN: Well, we are out to save money. 
CHRISTIAN: Yes. 
CHRISTIAN: You didn't. 
CHRISTIAN: You said "World, this is my blood! It's red, just like yours. So love me!" 
CHRISTIAN: You were really brave! You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.

CLARK:  Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on.  Erin, do you know anybody that might want...  Oh my gosh. You love the news, right? 
CLARK:  Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is  our relationship is  terr-

CLARK:  Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election  thing is crazy, right? 
CLARK:  You interviewing for the sales job too? 
CLARK:  You re looking good. 
CLARK: A gentleman doesn t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved. 
CLARK: A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours. 
CLARK: Actually, uh, I'm the consultant. Got milk? Ha ha. Alright, let's see what we're working with. 
CLARK: All I m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager s chair. And I thought you wanted that job. 
CLARK: All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And and Wallace is here today. And I don t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here? 
CLARK: All right. 
CLARK: All right. 
CLARK: All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody. 
CLARK: Alright, let s see you do it. 
CLARK: Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh... 
CLARK: Alright, that s enough,  cause I can say some things about him too. 
CLARK: And then what? 
CLARK: And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so- 
CLARK: And you can just... The baby should grab on to that. 
CLARK: Any good weekend plans? 
CLARK: Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds. 
CLARK: Aw, come on. 
CLARK: Blunt? 
CLARK: But I fought for this seat. 
CLARK: Catch? 
CLARK: Come back. 
CLARK: Come in.

CLARK: Congrats, Dwight. 
CLARK: Damn it. 
CLARK: Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get. 
CLARK: Did you?  
CLARK: Do what? Get into sales? That s what I want. 
CLARK: Don't do it.  
CLARK: Driving. 
CLARK: Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam. 
CLARK: Dude, this size of my haunches   
CLARK: Dude, we're being conned. 
CLARK: Dwight, for the last time, she s not a waitress. 
CLARK: God! 
CLARK: God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge. 
CLARK: God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air. 
CLARK: Great, now we got three hours to fill. 
CLARK: He calls me Clarky  cause he s my Dad. 
CLARK: Here we go again, another lecture from the old man. Suit Store 
CLARK: Here we go! 
CLARK: He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape. 
CLARK: Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for? 
CLARK: Hey guys. 
CLARK: Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview? 
CLARK: Hey, can I talk to you for one second? 
CLARK: Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next? 
CLARK: Hey, Dwight. 
CLARK: Hey, how was the singing show audition? 
CLARK: Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark. Todd 
CLARK: Hey, Pam, I m going to the kitchen. You want anything? 
CLARK: Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right? 
CLARK: Hey, so I hear you re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job? 
CLARK: Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out? 
CLARK: Hey, wait, wait, how how are we doing this?

CLARK: I don t either. 
CLARK: I don't even know what an auger is! 
CLARK: I don't want to teach you Power Point. 
CLARK: I ll give it a read. 
CLARK: I love it. 
CLARK: I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That s why his face always breaks out. Suit Store 
CLARK: I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond  and under. 
CLARK: I think I m busy that night. Or I would. 
CLARK: I ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears. 
CLARK: I was thinking about  
CLARK: I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night. 
CLARK: I would love a corn dog. 
CLARK: I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue. 
CLARK: If it ll lead to me being a salesman, I ll pretend to be your friend. 
CLARK: If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission. 
CLARK: I'll get that for you. 
CLARK: I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow. 
CLARK: I'm good. I.. 
CLARK: Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him? 
CLARK: Is this is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that s totally fine. Like, I m fine with it. But you should know that I m into the ladies. 
CLARK: Isn t the client, like, best friends with his sister? 
CLARK: It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful. 
CLARK: It's a medical thing. 
CLARK: It's porn. 
CLARK: It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome. 
CLARK: It's what I do.  
CLARK: Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really?  Yikes. That is awful. 
CLARK: Just clap through it, man. 
CLARK: Just do the tutorial. 
CLARK: Just say  arms  and  legs,  okay? That just that s the vernacular that I m comfortable with. 
CLARK: Kay. 
CLARK: 'Kay.  
CLARK: Learning what? 
CLARK: Let s talk. Suit Store 
CLARK: Like the time that you got drunk and, and then  Killed those kids on their way to prom! 
CLARK: Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now. 
CLARK: Mmm. 
CLARK: Mm-mm. 
CLARK: My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he s like a serial killer  of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick!  
CLARK: My mistake. 
CLARK: Nice. 
CLARK: No! 
CLARK: No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.

CLARK: No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends. Suit Store 
CLARK: No, we got it. We got it. 
CLARK: No, we sure hadn t Pop.

CLARK: Right. Well, I m here to sell paper. 
CLARK: Right. Yeah. But, you know, I ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I ve earned this. I mean, you know? 
CLARK: Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl. 
CLARK: Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way. 
CLARK: She's living a lie. 
CLARK: So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven t had time to pursue yet?

CLARK: So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing. Suit Store 
CLARK: So how d you guys hear about the position? 
CLARK: So I d Kobayashi Maru it. 
CLARK: So if you look at our catalog here  Athlead 
CLARK: So Pete was a librarian? 
CLARK: So we can offer you matte or glossy printing- 
CLARK: So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders. 
CLARK: So you guys all know Dwight already? 
CLARK: So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time. 
CLARK: Stimulate it. 
CLARK: Stretch. Alright. 
CLARK: Sweet. 
CLARK: Terrible. 
CLARK: Thanks, dude. 
CLARK: Thanks, dude. You you sure it s okay?  Cause you re kinda  
CLARK: That s a little weird. 
CLARK: That s actually really smart. 
CLARK: That s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete s beautiful, dead eyes. 
CLARK: That s how you do that! Whoo! 
CLARK: That s just a classic no-win situation. 
CLARK: The same thing that you think. 
CLARK: There he is. 
CLARK: There s obviously a volume discount uh, if you- 
CLARK: There you go, good for you. 
CLARK: These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor. 
CLARK: They got us set up with Windows 95, so you re kind of dreaming here. 
CLARK: They're tasteful. 
CLARK: Think it over.  
CLARK: This interview s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru d the whole process. 
CLARK: This is never gonna work. 
CLARK: This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome. 
CLARK: Uh, I don t know yet. 
CLARK: Uh, I guess I could give it shot. 
CLARK: Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut. 
CLARK: Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where s the band?  Cause there s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths. 
CLARK: Was he like the sexy librarian? 
CLARK: We can t just leave him bubble wrapped like this. 
CLARK: We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something. 
CLARK: We should probably call a doctor or something, dude. 
CLARK: Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind. 
CLARK: Well, I understand, but   
CLARK: Well, I wouldn t be so sure about that. I mean, I ve been working here 12 weeks. That s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we ve seen. 
CLARK: Well, if I may, you re a natural. 
CLARK: Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys. 
CLARK: Well, that s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island. 
CLARK: Well, uh  see, you raised it. 
CLARK: Well, you know, I m also Customer Service. 
CLARK: Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay?

CLARK: Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months? 
CLARK: Wintergreen. 
CLARK: Women don t despise me  
CLARK: Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was  like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh  like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room. 
CLARK: X-Men school? 
CLARK: Yeah yup yup. 
CLARK: Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this? 
CLARK: Yeah, good nose. 
CLARK: Yeah, I ll just give it a glance  
CLARK: Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back. 
CLARK: Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand. 
CLARK: Yeah. 
CLARK: Yeah. 
CLARK: Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.

CLARK: Yep, she's done. 
CLARK: Yep. 
CLARK: Yes! All right! 
CLARK: Yes, congratulations. 
CLARK: Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her. 
CLARK: You didn't actually say that. Todd

CO-WORKER: Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim?

CRAIG: Hey. 
CRAIG: I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal. 
CRAIG: Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know. 
CRAIG: No, I just ignored her. She's the worse. 
CRAIG: Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said "You gotta fire four people," and I was just like, "What?" Ya know? 
CRAIG: Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too.  
CRAIG: She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that bitch. 
CRAIG: That is correct, yes. 
CRAIG: What? You like Jan? How can you like Jan? 
CRAIG: What's up buddy? 
CRAIG: Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot. 
CREED:    
CREED:   I think it's 75 cents. 
CREED:   No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do this, I'm gonna do that. 
CREED:   One more week. 
CREED:   There you go. 
CREED:   You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you. 
CREED:  And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before. 
CREED:  Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this? 
CREED:  BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first "B" stand for? 
CREED:  Can we get another round? 
CREED:  Creed Bratton is the new manager!  
CREED:  Daat! 
CREED:  Find out what language this is.  
CREED:  First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business.  Saving face.  Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this] 
CREED:  For me? 
CREED:  Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant.  
CREED:  Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her. She's got some children. 
CREED:  Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater. 
CREED:  Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet. 
CREED:  Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.

CREED:  Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look!  Hey! It's the temp! Look!  
CREED:  Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed. 
CREED:  How old? 
CREED:  I know. Isn't it something? 
CREED:  I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn t matter.  Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same  
CREED:  I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly. 
CREED:  It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton.  Keep it running. 
CREED:  It's a photo of all of us. 
CREED:  Jim. 
CREED:  New glasses. 
CREED:  Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs! 
CREED:  Oh, come on! 
CREED:  Oh, I m saving a fortune on dry cleaning. 
CREED:  Oh, no. 
CREED:  Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay. 
CREED:  Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy,  and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed... 
CREED:  See ya tomorrow boss! 
CREED:  Sorry I'm late, boss. What's going on? 
CREED:  Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya... 
CREED:  Thank God. 
CREED:  Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god. 
CREED:  The pleasure's all mine. 
CREED:  They've been in there a while. 
CREED:  Uh, boss, we're out of paper. 
CREED:  Uh..ohh! 
CREED:  Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph. 
CREED:  What did you hit me for? 
CREED:  Who do you think did it? 
CREED:  Yo, is this his new chair? 
CREED:  You got Creed. 
CREED:  you!  you! God! 
CREED: $3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen. 
CREED: ...Excuse me. 
CREED: 82 November first. How much is the prize money? 
CREED: A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless. 
CREED: A wheel wants to spin, Pam. 
CREED: About what? 
CREED: Ah, Dwell. 
CREED: Ah, Hillary Swank. 
CREED: Ahhhh!!!   
CREED: All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her. 
CREED: All right, thank you, bye-bye. 
CREED: All right. 
CREED: And a happy holiday to you. 
CREED: Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her.  Creed. 
CREED: Animals can't feel pain. 
CREED: Any time. 
CREED: Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal? 
CREED: Are you gonna add any more? 
CREED: Are you out?  Pumpkin's out, let's go gang!  
CREED: Bald people make me sick. 
CREED: Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate. 
CREED: Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work. Sweeney 
CREED: Because they're lame. 
CREED: Beleniege! 
CREED: Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good. 
CREED: Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, "Have you heard my originals? They're terrible." They said, "Even better." I said, "I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie." 
CREED: Bonnie Hunt is on. 
CREED: Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here. 
CREED: Can I go? 
CREED: Can't be good. 
CREED: Challenge. 
CREED: Come on, boss. 
CREED: Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry. We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there. 
CREED: Cool beans. 
CREED: Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider. 
CREED: Creed Bratton, 75 plus division. 
CREED: Creed! Ha! 
CREED: Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted. 
CREED: Did you start the paperwork yet? 
CREED: Ditto that, my brother. 
CREED: Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate.  I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling. 
CREED: Ed was decapitated. 
CREED: Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens. 
CREED: Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long.  
CREED: Everything's cool, dude. 
CREED: Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him. 
CREED: Exactly. 
CREED: Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon. 
CREED: For a cat? I could get you a kid for that. 
CREED: Fright. Being scared to death. 
CREED: Get her Phyll. 
CREED: Give it up, he's dead. 
CREED: Good night, Mary Beth! 
CREED: Good work, kid. 
CREED: Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping. 
CREED: Great.  
CREED: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three! 
CREED: Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant. 
CREED: Hank, his name is Hank. 
CREED: Have fun!  
CREED: Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim? 
CREED: Have you ever seen a foot with four toes?  
CREED: Have you tried making everything smaller? 
CREED: Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did. 
CREED: He don't give an "F" about nothin'! 
CREED: He has no wallet, I checked. 
CREED: He put some snacks in the freezer for us. 
CREED: He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off. 
CREED: Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma. 
CREED: Hell of an ass. 
CREED: Hello.  
CREED: Here. 
CREED: Here's the $40 you gave me. 
CREED: He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean. 
CREED: Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems. 
CREED: Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man. 
CREED: Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam. 
CREED: Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together.  Pam as "fourth-biggest 
CREED: Hey! 
CREED: Hey! What are you guys doing here? Student 
CREED: Hey, Angela's back with her baby. 
CREED: Hey, boss, did you find Nemo? 
CREED: Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can.  Oh! 
CREED: Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work. 
CREED: Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay? 
CREED: Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age? 
CREED: Hey, why haven't we ever, um... 
CREED: Hi guys. Somebody makin' soup? 
CREED: Hi kids. 
CREED: HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow! 
CREED: Hi, hello. 
CREED: How far along? 
CREED: How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours?  Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours?  Good. 
CREED: How'd I get this long triangle? 
CREED: Huh? 
CREED: I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport. 
CREED: I can bring these to my shelter. 
CREED: I can get you one in an hour. 
CREED: I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat. 
CREED: I did it! 
CREED: I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen. 
CREED: I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site. 
CREED: I don't know, man. I just don't know. 
CREED: I don't know. 
CREED: I don't know. It was so long ago. 
CREED: I don't think I'm there yet, Boss. 
CREED: I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic. 
CREED: I find it offensive. Au natural, baby. That's how I like 'em. Swing low, sweet chariots. 
CREED: I hate devils food. 
CREED: I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'. 
CREED: I hear it, too, Boss. 
CREED: I heard that from... Andy. 
CREED: I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death. 
CREED: I know you don t really exist. 
CREED: I like it! Business! Good, Kevin!  All right! The "O"... 
CREED: I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today. 
CREED: I m sure it ll turn up. Athlead 
CREED: I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless. 
CREED: I miss Clinton. 
CREED: I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant. 
CREED: I pay for that privilege.  
CREED: I really appreciate it, Boss. 
CREED: I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30. Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  Something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter--- 
CREED: I remember. I blogged the whole thing. 
CREED: I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station. 
CREED: I saw the leaves twitch! 
CREED: I still have my medal from that. 
CREED: I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole. 
CREED: I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela.  It's Angela. Get her, boys. 
CREED: I think you two should meet. 
CREED: I thought you might. 
CREED: I thought you were gay. 
CREED: I understand it, I can't speak it. 
CREED: I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes. 
CREED: I want a nice cobbler. 
CREED: I want pie. I want peach pie. 
CREED: I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel. 
CREED: I want to sell your blood! 
CREED: I watch you when you sleep. 
CREED: I'd like to contribute. 
CREED: I'd send you to Hong Kong. 
CREED: If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward? 
CREED: If that's flashing, then lock me up. 
CREED: I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair... 
CREED: I'm having a little trouble motivating. 
CREED: I'm just looking. 
CREED: I'm out. 
CREED: I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy. 
CREED: I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty. 
CREED: I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you. 
CREED: In a minute. 
CREED: In a way you did. 
CREED: In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company. 
CREED: It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But  no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home.  Let s do this. 
CREED: It s Halloween. That is really, really good timing. 
CREED: It's a real shame about Ed, huh? 
CREED: It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh? 
CREED: It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in? 
CREED: It's Kismet!
CREED: It's not cool. 
CREED: It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military. 
CREED: It's the temp!  
CREED: It's thrilling. 
CREED: I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader. 
CREED: Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark. 
CREED: Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me. 
CREED: Jinx. Buy me some Coke. 
CREED: Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave. 
CREED: Let me have a turn. 
CREED: Let s find out what I did. 
CREED: Let s try it out. 
CREED: Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days. 
CREED: Let's fight it. 
CREED: Let's put a smile on that face! 
CREED: Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska? 
CREED: Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China.  
CREED: Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care. 
CREED: Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away. 
CREED: Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good. 
CREED: Me neither. 
CREED: Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students. 
CREED: Michael, undo it! 
CREED: Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that. 
CREED: Mm-hmm. 
CREED: Mmmhm. 
CREED: Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach. 
CREED: My tombstone's already made, thank you. 
CREED: My wife s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps. 
CREED: Night 
CREED: No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now. 
CREED: No, but I still have my medal from that. 
CREED: No, I don't. I wanna stay right here. 
CREED: No, I wanna stay here. 
CREED: No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man. 
CREED: No, you have the power to undo it. 
CREED: No. 
CREED: No. No. No. You re way off on that one. 
CREED: No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch. 
CREED: No... 
CREED: Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name?   Creed Bratton. 
CREED: Not cool man.  
CREED: Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang. 
CREED: Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would have caught this. 
CREED: Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo. 
CREED: Oh ho! Which one is Pam? 
CREED: Oh my goodness. 
CREED: Oh nothing. 
CREED: Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What... 
CREED: Oh, he does. He does. 
CREED: Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things. Billy's 
CREED: Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing. 
CREED: Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis. 
CREED: Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo? 
CREED: Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy? 
CREED: Oh.  
CREED: Oh... Where did you get this stuff? 
CREED: Ok, thirty seconds to showtime! 
CREED: OK. Hang on just a second. Let me just settle in and I'll be right back. 
CREED: Okay. 
CREED: Okay. What about your friend? 
CREED: On the go that's after three. 
CREED: Pirate code, he wants to meet. 
CREED: Psst...  
CREED: Really? I thought you.  
CREED: Remember, you re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this. 
CREED: Right place at the right time. 
CREED: Ryan! 
CREED: Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in? 
CREED: Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday. 
CREED: She's crazy hot. 
CREED: She's looking good. 
CREED: She's messed up man... 
CREED: She's one sassy black lady. 
CREED: So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter. 
CREED: So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this.  Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less. 
CREED: Something's up. That paper was never supposed to arrive. 
CREED: Sometimes it's best just to say out of it. 
CREED: Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand? 
CREED: Sure. 
CREED: Sure. He hired me. How's he doing? 
CREED: Tapas swiss miss. 
CREED: Thank you very much. 
CREED: Thanks mom. 
CREED: Thanks. 
CREED: Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator. 
CREED: That is correct. 
CREED: That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica. 
CREED: That wasn't a tapeworm. 
CREED: That's crazy. It's crazy. 
CREED: That's from me. 
CREED: That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man? 
CREED: That's kinda uncool, man. 
CREED: That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby! 
CREED: That's not why. 
CREED: That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up? 
CREED: The balls on you, man. 
CREED: The feeling of pure risk. 
CREED: The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss? 
CREED: The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap... 
CREED: The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did... when I was a homeless man. 
CREED: The perfect cartwheel. 
CREED: The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though. 
CREED: The tall guy got engaged. 
CREED: Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door?

CREED: There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train? 
CREED: These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly. 
CREED: They make a nice couple. 
CREED: Think they're talking about me? 
CREED: This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.

CREED: Undo it! 
CREED: Us? You and me. The old timers. 
CREED: Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.

CREED: What are you telling me? 
CREED: What did I say? 
CREED: What if you've been bad? 
CREED: What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong? 
CREED: What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. "What do I do?"... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. "Qua" something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close. 
CREED: What size? Business Student

CREED: Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect. 
CREED: Yes, sir. 
CREED: Yes, sir. 
CREED: Yes. 
CREED: You are welcome. 
CREED: You did good. You did good. 
CREED: You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up "get out of jail free" cards, those things cost thousands. 
CREED: You don't have to do this, Michael. 
CREED: You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby. 
CREED: You don't want to do that. 
CREED: You ever notice you can ooze two

CREED: You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client. 
CREED: You shouldn't have hit me, Michael. 
CREED: You shut up! 
CREED: You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means. 
CREED: You think? 
CREED: You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners. 
CREED: You're welcome. 
CREED:: I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain. And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing. 
CRESS: Ohh... God...

DANNY: Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper. 
DANNY: Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you. 
DANNY: Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago? 
DANNY: Exactly. 
DANNY: Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar. 
DANNY: For sure.

DANNY: I'll talk to them. 
DANNY: I'm gonna go.

DANNY: It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you. 
DANNY: I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh? 
DANNY: Jim and Pam really don't want you to go? 
DANNY: Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history. 
DANNY: Michael Scott. 
DANNY: More freedom. 
DANNY: No! Two or three dates. 
DANNY: Obviously. I don't even think she called me back. 
DANNY: Oh, I'm just here for the coffee. 
DANNY: Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey!  Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here. 
DANNY: Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates. 
DANNY: Oh. 
DANNY: Oh. She was not into me. 
DANNY: Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique? 
DANNY: Okay. 
DANNY: Okay. 
DANNY: Okay. 
DANNY: Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky. 
DANNY: Okay. You wanna know? I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you. 
DANNY: Okay...that's different. 
DANNY: Or...crazy. 
DANNY: Public School, at exit 11. 
DANNY: So. You're all on the list! 
DANNY: Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy. 
DANNY: Thank you. 
DANNY: Thanks. 
DANNY: This is some party, huh? 
DANNY: Three of you guys for one sale. 
DANNY: Uh...I mean-yeah. 
DANNY: Was it two? I thought it was three. 
DANNY: We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you? 
DANNY: Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit. 
DANNY: Well, we'll get this... 
DANNY: Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right. 
DANNY: What are you talking about? 
DANNY: What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that!  
DANNY: Yeah, sure. 
DANNY: Yeah. Way ,way, way back. 
DANNY: You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and... 
DANNY: You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so- 
DARRLY:  Merry Christmas.

DARRYL: Damn! 
DARRYL: Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out! 
DARRYL: Darryl is dating Val... still. 
DARRYL: Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers. 
DARRYL: Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I m here. 
DARRYL: Did you hire 'em? 
DARRYL: Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control. 
DARRYL: Do it! 
DARRYL: Do you understand that? 
DARRYL: Don't don't bother Luke. Got it. 
DARRYL: Don't go breaking my scale. 
DARRYL: Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change. 
DARRYL: Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name. 
DARRYL: Dracula. 
DARRYL: Dreaming he's a dog on a island. 
DARRYL: Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow. 
DARRYL: Dude. 
DARRYL: Dunder Mifflin. Andy, Creed, Kevin, 
DARRYL: Dunder Mifflin. Andy, Creed, Kevin, 
DARRYL: Dunder Mifflin. Andy, Creed, Kevin, 
DARRYL: Dwight! 
DARRYL: Dwight, come back and spot me. 
DARRYL: Dwight, look, I m sorry you re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that. 
DARRYL: Dwight. 
DARRYL: Dwight? 
DARRYL: Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years. 
DARRYL: Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about. 
DARRYL: Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am. 
DARRYL: Every day. Andy and 
DARRYL: Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it. 
DARRYL: Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now? 
DARRYL: Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence. 
DARRYL: Exactly like this. Fast Food 
DARRYL: Except my warehouse. 
DARRYL: Excuse me? 
DARRYL: Figured I look presentable.  You?  Went a different way. 
DARRYL: Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call? 
DARRYL: Follow me, I got a space. After you. I ve been thinking about you all mornin . I don t know what you did, I can barely walk today. 
DARRYL: Forget it, man. 
DARRYL: Four hours. Almost halfway there. 
DARRYL: Fourteen years long. 
DARRYL: Fun. 
DARRYL: Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game. 
DARRYL: Get under your chin first. Yeah. 
DARRYL: Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son. 
DARRYL: Getting my sweat on. 
DARRYL: Give me your job. 
DARRYL: Glen, could you excuse us?  
DARRYL: Go ahead. 
DARRYL: Go, Dwight Jr! 
DARRYL: Good luck to you. 
DARRYL: Good luck with that. 
DARRYL: Good morning. 
DARRYL: Good morning. 
DARRYL: Good policy. Sensible. Smart. 
DARRYL: Good slam. 
DARRYL: Good times. 
DARRYL: Goodnight. 
DARRYL: Got it. 
DARRYL: Great. 
DARRYL: Guess I m going upstairs. 
DARRYL: Guys, guys. That s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7. 
DARRYL: Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer.  
DARRYL: Happy hour. My pleasure. 
DARRYL: Has that ever happened? Ever? 
DARRYL: He died. 
DARRYL: He does not like that wall. 
DARRYL: He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with. 
DARRYL: He s been sailing for two days. 
DARRYL: Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim s company. 
DARRYL: Hell yeah! 
DARRYL: Hell yeah. You know why? Because that was my baby. 
DARRYL: Hello, hello. 
DARRYL: Help me! 
DARRYL: Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do. 
DARRYL: Her. Yes, "her" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay? 
DARRYL: Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell. 
DARRYL: Here you go. 
DARRYL: Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you. 
DARRYL: He's got to go, Mike. 
DARRYL: He's not my hire, but I know who he is. 
DARRYL: Hey Andy. 
DARRYL: Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face. 
DARRYL: Hey let's go to Poor Richard's. 
DARRYL: Hey man. 
DARRYL: Hey Michael. This ain't over. 
DARRYL: Hey Mike, do my thing. 
DARRYL: Hey Mike. 
DARRYL: Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking. 
DARRYL: Hey what's up? You called? 
DARRYL: Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio. 
DARRYL: Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  Yeah. 
DARRYL: Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man. 
DARRYL: Hey! Sweeney 
DARRYL: Hey, Andy. 
DARRYL: Hey, are we doing this thing? 
DARRYL: Hey, come here. You guys need to see this. 
DARRYL: Hey, get off. 
DARRYL: Hey, hey, hey. I ll do one thing with y all. 
DARRYL: Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time. 
DARRYL: Hey, how'd you do? 
DARRYL: Hey, I like you. Oh yeah, what's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course. 
DARRYL: Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber. 
DARRYL: Hey, just so you know, me and you  I don't think that's ridiculous  Dot, dot, dot  dot, dot.  
DARRYL: Hey, let's call this what it is. 
DARRYL: Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right? 
DARRYL: Hey, man. Darryl. Ryan 
DARRYL: Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um I didn t call  cause I figured you changed the number. 
DARRYL: Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today. 
DARRYL: Hey, Mike. 
DARRYL: Hey, Pam! How are you? 
DARRYL: Hey, what s up? 
DARRYL: Hey, what's up? 
DARRYL: Hey, why don't you and me play those? 
DARRYL: Hey. 
DARRYL: Hey. 
DARRYL: Hey. 
DARRYL: Hey. 
DARRYL: Hey. 
DARRYL: Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your...  meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party. 
DARRYL: Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that? 
DARRYL: Hey...  You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it. 
DARRYL: Hi. 
DARRYL: Hiding from his momma. Warehouse 
DARRYL: Higher.  
DARRYL: Hmhmm. 
DARRYL: Hmm. Yeah right 
DARRYL: Ho-ho! 
DARRYL: Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope. 
DARRYL: Holy , what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant. 
DARRYL: Hope it's all right. 
DARRYL: How about the sales department is the sails? 
DARRYL: How about you, man. Comfortable? 
DARRYL: How do I do that? 
DARRYL: How far is this place?  
DARRYL: How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler? 
DARRYL: How much did you pay for that? 
DARRYL: How much? 
DARRYL: How would you like it if we booed you? 
DARRYL: Huh? 
DARRYL: Hunger for hamburger. 
DARRYL: I agree. I think it's superb. 
DARRYL: I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want. 
DARRYL: I asked for a list.  ...and a clown. 
DARRYL: I been selling here for five years. This is my spot. 
DARRYL: I believe I want to go home. 
DARRYL: I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there. 
DARRYL: I can go get us some tacos. 
DARRYL: I can hear you. 
DARRYL: I can t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks. 
DARRYL: I can videotape it. 
DARRYL: I can't--- what, Mike? Are you--- 
DARRYL: I can't. You know that. 
DARRYL: I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong. And I ain't that brave. 
DARRYL: I did. 
DARRYL: I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point. 
DARRYL: I didn t realize we were this close. 
DARRYL: I didn't have time because of my daughter. 
DARRYL: I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here. 
DARRYL: I didn't say "a'ight." 
DARRYL: I didn't say anything. 
DARRYL: I don t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though. 
DARRYL: I don t do that anymore. 
DARRYL: I don t think I sh- 
DARRYL: I don't 
DARRYL: I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz.  Andy don't mess with me.  I'll figure something out. 
DARRYL: I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying. 
DARRYL: I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens. 
DARRYL: I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was-  ooh, hold on a second.  Oh. 
DARRYL: I don't know. 
DARRYL: I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak? 
DARRYL: I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter. 
DARRYL: I don't understand the point of a hat. 
DARRYL: I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore. 
DARRYL: I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking. 
DARRYL: I find you absolutely ribbiting! 
DARRYL: I got it. I'm doin' it. 
DARRYL: I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though. 
DARRYL: I got Source Code on the way back. 
DARRYL: I got that cutie behind the counter. Bookstore 
DARRYL: I had no idea. This plumber has pipes! 
DARRYL: I had to. I needed defense. 
DARRYL: I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all. 
DARRYL: I hate myself. 
DARRYL: I hate that too. 
DARRYL: I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process. 
DARRYL: I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation. 
DARRYL: I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm...  bla-aaack! 
DARRYL: I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web. 
DARRYL: I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right? 
DARRYL: I have plans later. 
DARRYL: I haven't been to New York in a long time. 
DARRYL: I haven't hired anyone. 
DARRYL: I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one. 
DARRYL: I included some time saving ideas... 
DARRYL: I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill. 
DARRYL: I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person. 
DARRYL: I just think you re going into this a little fast. 
DARRYL: I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed. 
DARRYL: I know he loves his pick up truck. 
DARRYL: I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt. 
DARRYL: I know who did that. 
DARRYL: I know, I know. It's just hard. 
DARRYL: I know, right. Merry Christmas. 
DARRYL: I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in? 
DARRYL: I like the sound of this.  Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something? 
DARRYL: I ll introduce you. 
DARRYL: I ll take a look. 
DARRYL: I love it. And it s Athleap now. And the city is amazing. 
DARRYL: I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to  soak... He hooked me up with a job. 
DARRYL: I love Philly! 
DARRYL: I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems. 
DARRYL: I loved it. 
DARRYL: I m going for a walk. 
DARRYL: I m lifting. 
DARRYL: I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster. 
DARRYL: I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out. 
DARRYL: I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch. 
DARRYL: I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper. 
DARRYL: I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard. 
DARRYL: I say we have a parade. 
DARRYL: I shall come by at your convenience. 
DARRYL: I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, "Fleece it out." "Going mach five." "Dinkin' flicka." You know, things us Negroes say. 
DARRYL: I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too. 
DARRYL: I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib. 
DARRYL: I thought that was your job. 
DARRYL: I thought you'd wear a sweater. 
DARRYL: I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses. 
DARRYL: I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool? 
DARRYL: I ve been meaning to join a gym.  For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents. 
DARRYL: I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I m gonna miss these guys. 
DARRYL: I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy s job in the bag until my interview. 
DARRYL: I was in The Whiz in high school. 
DARRYL: I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me. 
DARRYL: I was still thinking of going back to school. 
DARRYL: I was talking like this.  I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me. 
DARRYL: I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay. 
DARRYL: I wasn't. 
DARRYL: I worked at a Jiffy Lube. 
DARRYL: I would if I owned it and I went broke. 
DARRYL: I would. 
DARRYL: I wouldn't enjoy that. 
DARRYL: I... I just thought you knew me. 
DARRYL: If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself. 
DARRYL: If this company s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it. 
DARRYL: If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months. 
DARRYL: If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare. 
DARRYL: If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What? 
DARRYL: If you loan me some money. 
DARRYL: If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then. 
DARRYL: If you're going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you're going my way... 
DARRYL: I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions.  
DARRYL: I'll be there. 
DARRYL: I'll be your croak monsieur. 
DARRYL: I'll come with you, show you how it's done. 
DARRYL: I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me. 
DARRYL: I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it. 
DARRYL: I'll put you down for shortbreads. 
DARRYL: I'll take him. 
DARRYL: I'll take one of those pink pouches. 
DARRYL: I'm back together with Val. Yay... 
DARRYL: I'm done. I gotta get out of here. 
DARRYL: I'm gonna tell Jim to go  himself. 
DARRYL: I'm good. 
DARRYL: I'm in. 
DARRYL: I'm just glad we're gonna try it out. 
DARRYL: I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week. 
DARRYL: I'm not mad. Are you mad? 
DARRYL: I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend. 
DARRYL: I'm out. And so is Toby. 
DARRYL: I'm sitting right here. 
DARRYL: I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros. Jim and 
DARRYL: I'm telling you how to do this man. 
DARRYL: I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that. 
DARRYL: I'm very busy here, man. 
DARRYL: I'm very busy with time-sensitive work. 
DARRYL: I'ma call Roy, man. 
DARRYL: Is she sick? How are her poops? 
DARRYL: Is that grease on my floor? 
DARRYL: It can. 
DARRYL: It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point. 
DARRYL: It has been processed. 
DARRYL: It is worth it. 
DARRYL: It s 30 degrees out. You drinkin  a mildshake? 
DARRYL: It s not pizza. 
DARRYL: It s ok E-Dog, just who called? 
DARRYL: It says decaf. You get me decaf? 
DARRYL: It was in the box. 
DARRYL: It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was "Andy," "Problem," "Eliminate," something. I don't know what it meant. 
DARRYL: It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it! 
DARRYL: It's all good, we got this. 
DARRYL: It's bad. 
DARRYL: It's cool really. 
DARRYL: It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions. 
DARRYL: It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes. 
DARRYL: It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out. 
DARRYL: It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this. 
DARRYL: It's defense. 
DARRYL: It's getting bigger. 
DARRYL: It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little  inspiration. 
DARRYL: It's Lejon Brames. 
DARRYL: It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door. 
DARRYL: It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union? 
DARRYL: It's not a race. Warehouse 
DARRYL: It's not a trash compactor! It's a baler! 
DARRYL: It's not even a thought  
DARRYL: It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets. 
DARRYL: It's not my real name. 
DARRYL: It's not real... until your wife is on board. 
DARRYL: It's not safe, you don't have a license. 
DARRYL: It's ok. 
DARRYL: It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good. 
DARRYL: It's real bad. 
DARRYL: It's so strong. Ryan 
DARRYL: It's trivia. 
DARRYL: I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one 
DARRYL: I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage. 
DARRYL: I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything? 
DARRYL: I've seen this, that's not you. 
DARRYL: Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents. 
DARRYL: Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin? 
DARRYL: Jim really doesn t want to come? 
DARRYL: Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom. 
DARRYL: Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse. 
DARRYL: J-j-j-ju... 
DARRYL: Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates. 
DARRYL: Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way. 
DARRYL: Just getting a tea bag. 
DARRYL: Kelly ordered this online. 
DARRYL: Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That s how you do that, baby. It s all good, I m ready. Y all ready for this?  
DARRYL: Kind of embarassing. 
DARRYL: Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
DARRYL: Let me put my shoes on.  
DARRYL: Let me see it! 
DARRYL: Let me see it. 
DARRYL: Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common. 
DARRYL: Let me...  Oh. Cool.  Merv 
DARRYL: Let s get a drink in you, huh? 
DARRYL: Life hacking, man. 
DARRYL: Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay? 
DARRYL: Like a joke? A knock-knock joke? 
DARRYL: Like he was... covering something up? Maybe. 
DARRYL: Like what? 
DARRYL: Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead. 
DARRYL: Look how happy he is. 
DARRYL: Look man this is a bad idea. 
DARRYL: Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self. 
DARRYL: Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird. 
DARRYL: Look, I heard about the office. Tough break. 
DARRYL: Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my  chubby daughter? 
DARRYL: Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself. 
DARRYL: Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me. 
DARRYL: Look, would ya... look. 
DARRYL: Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues. 
DARRYL: Looking good, RC! 
DARRYL: Looks that way. 
DARRYL: Loyalty. 
DARRYL: Make a delivery. 
DARRYL: Make a real gym. 
DARRYL: Make it happen, cap'in. 
DARRYL: Make that face he likes. 
DARRYL: Man, hook you up. 
DARRYL: Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally. 
DARRYL: Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with. 
DARRYL: Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated. 
DARRYL: Maybe forever. Anyhow  
DARRYL: Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there. 
DARRYL: Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold. 
DARRYL: Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, "What are you gonna do, breakup with me?" Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight. 
DARRYL: Me. 
DARRYL: Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.  
DARRYL: Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat. 
DARRYL: Michael. 
DARRYL: Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right? 
DARRYL: Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People. 
DARRYL: Mike you'll drive this every weekend? 
DARRYL: Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse. 
DARRYL: Mike, I'm very busy down here.  
DARRYL: Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog.  
DARRYL: Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself. 
DARRYL: Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind? 
DARRYL: Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest. 
DARRYL: Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean, it takes courage just to be you. To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you. 
DARRYL: Mike. 
DARRYL: Mike. 
DARRYL: Mike. 
DARRYL: Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now. 
DARRYL: Mm, it's not that big. 
DARRYL: Mm-hmm 
DARRYL: Mmhmm.  Caramel soy latte. 
DARRYL: Mmm.  
DARRYL: Mmmmm. 
DARRYL: More universal. 
DARRYL: Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It s very unlikely it would happen again. Mr. 
DARRYL: My bad. 
DARRYL: My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time. 
DARRYL: My daughter. 
DARRYL: My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do. 
DARRYL: My pleasure.  Video 
DARRYL: My priority is safety. 
DARRYL: My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl. 
DARRYL: My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him. 
DARRYL: Nah man, we get along now. Real well. 
DARRYL: Nah, nah... 
DARRYL: Nah. I play for pleasure. 
DARRYL: Nahh!  No. Not Justine. Never Justine. 
DARRYL: Newsies. 
DARRYL: Next exit isn't for five miles. 
DARRYL: Nice scatting, man. 
DARRYL: Nice. 
DARRYL: Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow!  
DARRYL: Nine first. 
DARRYL: No big deal. No big deal. 
DARRYL: No do not touch it! 
DARRYL: No man, we are. 
DARRYL: No no no no. I like her. 
DARRYL: No! No no no no no! I said should you. You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift, you understand? 
DARRYL: No, he doesn't.  I told her Santa would be here. 
DARRYL: No, I'm good. Keep them. 
DARRYL: No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition. 
DARRYL: No, no, I m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn t say goodbye to. 
DARRYL: No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything. 
DARRYL: No, no, no, no. It's not worth it. 
DARRYL: No, no, no. 
DARRYL: No, no, no. Maybe just later. 
DARRYL: No, no, no... 
DARRYL: No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song. 
DARRYL: No, that's not as much fun. You know what? 
DARRYL: No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn. 
DARRYL: No, um... I have. 
DARRYL: No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da na na na na. 
DARRYL: No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time. 
DARRYL: No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what? 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. 
DARRYL: No. Can't let you do that Mike. 
DARRYL: No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company. 
DARRYL: No. I was clearing my throat. 
DARRYL: No. No. 
DARRYL: No. Thank you for your interest in my truck. 
DARRYL: No. You're wrong. 
DARRYL: No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that. 
DARRYL: No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me. 
DARRYL: Nobody told me what people were, alright? So... label yourselves or take what you get. 
DARRYL: Nope. His name is Michael.   
DARRYL: Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers. 
DARRYL: Not really. 
DARRYL: Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That s why I m doing it. 
DARRYL: Nothing.  It's mine.   What happened to my Tavis Smileys? 
DARRYL: Now, this is the forklift. You need---  You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workers can't drive it. ... Quiz! Mike. 
DARRYL: Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym. 
DARRYL: Obviously, so happy for them both. 
DARRYL: Oh  yeah. 
DARRYL: Oh baby I love your way. 
DARRYL: Oh baby I love your way. 
DARRYL: Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop. 
DARRYL: Oh my goodness. 
DARRYL: Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about. 
DARRYL: Oh yeah. 
DARRYL: Oh yeah. 
DARRYL: Oh yeah. 
DARRYL: Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place. 
DARRYL: Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real. 
DARRYL: Oh, don't worry about it. 
DARRYL: Oh, hey Val. 
DARRYL: Oh, hey. 
DARRYL: Oh, hey. Hey, what s up, y all? 
DARRYL: Oh, I never sing with soul. 
DARRYL: Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  Ah.  
DARRYL: Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag. 
DARRYL: Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere.  
DARRYL: Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up. 
DARRYL: Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing.  I banged this girl right here. This is... 
DARRYL: Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody. 
DARRYL: Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do. 
DARRYL: Oh, oh, I m sure we did. 
DARRYL: Oh, ok. 
DARRYL: Oh, thank you. 
DARRYL: Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here. 
DARRYL: Oh, what's up, Roy? 
DARRYL: Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done. 
DARRYL: Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too. 
DARRYL: Oh, yeah? 
DARRYL: Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up  You see that? This is the greatest night of my life. 
DARRYL: Oh? 
DARRYL: Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch! 
DARRYL: Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski!  
DARRYL: OK, don't fire me. 
DARRYL: OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds. 
DARRYL: OK, great. 
DARRYL: Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy! 
DARRYL: Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there. 
DARRYL: OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color. 
DARRYL: OK. 
DARRYL: OK. 
DARRYL: Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you. 
DARRYL: Okay, can you just stand right there?  I gotta send some e-mails. 
DARRYL: Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now. 
DARRYL: Okay, I'm not doing that. 
DARRYL: Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go.  
DARRYL: Okay. 
DARRYL: Okay. I'll keep working. 
DARRYL: Once you read the packet, sign the back. 
DARRYL: One more, yeah.  
DARRYL: One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals.  
DARRYL: One second, one second, one second.  So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl? 
DARRYL: One, two, three, hit it. 
DARRYL: Pam. 
DARRYL: Paper business. 
DARRYL: Paper material, ma'am. 
DARRYL: Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs. 
DARRYL: Perfect. 
DARRYL: Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something? 
DARRYL: Pick it up. 
DARRYL: Please call me back. 
DARRYL: Please... 
DARRYL: Popsicles? 
DARRYL: Presbyterian. 
DARRYL: Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place. 
DARRYL: Processed. 
DARRYL: Put it on, man. 
DARRYL: Rachel from the party? 
DARRYL: Really? 
DARRYL: Really? That is messed up man. 
DARRYL: Right in here? 
DARRYL: Right on, son. 
DARRYL: Right there. 
DARRYL: Right. 
DARRYL: Rosebud? 
DARRYL: Roy left years ago. What's his name? 
DARRYL: Say stuff like, "Good morning, Good Afternoon". People appreciate that. 
DARRYL: Scoopity-splash! 
DARRYL: Send me one too. 
DARRYL: Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going. 
DARRYL: Seriously? 
DARRYL: She did? 
DARRYL: She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon? 
DARRYL: She thought I was McNabb.   
DARRYL: She was about to turn 97. 
DARRYL: She's got a boyfriend. 
DARRYL: She's trying. 
DARRYL: Shh! Movie's almost over. 
DARRYL: Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later. 
DARRYL: Should you drive the forklift? 
DARRYL: Show business is cold. Let s say you get a job, which you probably won t. They re not gonna cut you any slack. You re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack. 
DARRYL: Show them what you brought, Mike. 
DARRYL: Silent. Look, congratulations. Sweeney 
DARRYL: Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here.  Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament. 
DARRYL: Slow down, think it over. 
DARRYL: Snap, for real? 
DARRYL: So how was the drive in? 
DARRYL: So I m like a three year old girl in this scenario  
DARRYL: So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin. 
DARRYL: So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh? 
DARRYL: So this is cool. I think we make a good fit.  
DARRYL: So you still missing Ryan? 
DARRYL: So you sure you remembered everything for your trip? 
DARRYL: So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.'  It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs. 
DARRYL: So, uh... here you go.  
DARRYL: So? 
DARRYL: Sold! To Jim. 
DARRYL: Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things. 
DARRYL: Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public. 
DARRYL: Something full of acid. 
DARRYL: Something wrong with the doll? 
DARRYL: Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know? 
DARRYL: Song's about truth. 
DARRYL: Sounds all right. 
DARRYL: Sounds great. 
DARRYL: Start over. 
DARRYL: Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound. 
DARRYL: Still no plan. 
DARRYL: Stupidest thing I've ever heard. 
DARRYL: Subway sandwiches. 
DARRYL: Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough. 
DARRYL: Sup? 
DARRYL: Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head. 
DARRYL: Sure, sweetie. 
DARRYL: Sure. 
DARRYL: Tacos were on sale, eight for $3! 
DARRYL: Tacos. 
DARRYL: Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah. 
DARRYL: Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out. 
DARRYL: Take them at the same time. 
DARRYL: Take your shot man! 
DARRYL: Taking a load off huh? 
DARRYL: Tell 'em your story, Hide. 
DARRYL: Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them? 
DARRYL: Thank God we only had a baler to deal with. 
DARRYL: Thank you go much. 
DARRYL: Thank you. 
DARRYL: Thank you. 
DARRYL: Thank you. 
DARRYL: Thank you. 
DARRYL: Thank you.  
DARRYL: Thank you. "Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted." "Have fun today, big guy." "Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop." 
DARRYL: Thanks man. 
DARRYL: Thanks T-Man, later.  He's lying. 
DARRYL: Thanks, it's cool. So... 
DARRYL: Thanks, man. 
DARRYL: Thanks, man. 
DARRYL: Thanks, man. 
DARRYL: Thanks.  Nice flowers. 
DARRYL: That bothers me too. 
DARRYL: That could work. 
DARRYL: That doesn't mean anything.  Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me? 
DARRYL: That felt really good, actually. 
DARRYL: That happens a lot? 
DARRYL: That s what I m talkin  about. 
DARRYL: That sounds awesome! 
DARRYL: That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go. 
DARRYL: That stuff can come back to get you. It s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle  
DARRYL: That there's a woman's suit. 
DARRYL: That thing were you softly exhale on her neck. 
DARRYL: That was a good one. 
DARRYL: That was a triple. 
DARRYL: That was cold. 
DARRYL: That was definitely not dancing. 
DARRYL: That was never agreed upon. 
DARRYL: That was you. 
DARRYL: That's a great plan. 
DARRYL: That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage. 
DARRYL: That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss. 
DARRYL: That's crazy money. I'll take forty. 
DARRYL: That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought? Park 
DARRYL: That's good. 
DARRYL: That's it. 
DARRYL: That's my go-to thermos. That's all. 
DARRYL: That's not a good reason. 
DARRYL: That's okay, Mike. 
DARRYL: That's regular text talk. 
DARRYL: That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum. 
DARRYL: That's what I'm talking about! 
DARRYL: That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin' on your biscuit. Never havin' to risk it. 
DARRYL: That's what we gotta do. 
DARRYL: That's what we need. 
DARRYL: That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them. 
DARRYL: That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay? 
DARRYL: That's your new standard. 
DARRYL: The 
DARRYL: The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat. 
DARRYL: The coconut's pretty subtle. 
DARRYL: The experience... 
DARRYL: The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do? 
DARRYL: The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement. 
DARRYL: The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese. 
DARRYL: The space dust does it. 
DARRYL: Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie. 
DARRYL: Then I think you should fire me. 
DARRYL: There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay? 
DARRYL: There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. "I'm coming over baby." And I would text back "BTB", bring that booty. 
DARRYL: There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar. 
DARRYL: There you go. 
DARRYL: There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring. 
DARRYL: There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this. 
DARRYL: There's nothing out here man. 
DARRYL: There's other pencil's in this office. 
DARRYL: These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers, Michael, should not go anywhere near them. 
DARRYL: These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck. 
DARRYL: They have fast food in Philly. 
DARRYL: They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home. 
DARRYL: They smell so bad. 
DARRYL: Things? People?  
DARRYL: Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk. 
DARRYL: Think that through for a sec. 
DARRYL: Thinking about my grandmother a lot. 
DARRYL: This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away. 
DARRYL: This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy. 
DARRYL: This is embarrassing, Michael. 
DARRYL: This is gonna make him feel better. 
DARRYL: This is not a good idea right here. 
DARRYL: This is the last of it. 
DARRYL: This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look.  Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim. 
DARRYL: This is too good. 
DARRYL: This is what you want? 
DARRYL: This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child. 
DARRYL: This party s tight. The fog is cool. 
DARRYL: This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do. 
DARRYL: This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution. 
DARRYL: This trip was longer than I thought. 
DARRYL: This was your freshman year. 
DARRYL: This...  
DARRYL: Three Kings. 
DARRYL: To look good for Val! 
DARRYL: To push this bar up. 
DARRYL: To the arcade. 
DARRYL: Toby! Dwight! Is that them? 
DARRYL: Too late. 
DARRYL: Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross. 
DARRYL: Two thousand one hundred seventy-five.   Sorry guys. 
DARRYL: Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said "Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient."  
DARRYL: Uh  yeah. Depending on traffic. 
DARRYL: Uh huh. 
DARRYL: Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that? 
DARRYL: Uh uh uh. Don't shush me. 
DARRYL: Uh weight lifting yeah. 
DARRYL: Uh, "The moon is huge tonight." 
DARRYL: Uh, no. 
DARRYL: Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman? 
DARRYL: Uh...  yes?! I was.  Little joke! 
DARRYL: Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what. 
DARRYL: Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5. 
DARRYL: Um, where did you get that story? 
DARRYL: Unh! Damn it! 
DARRYL: Union! Union, yeah. 
DARRYL: Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right? 
DARRYL: Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a  we're just friends  beanie or a  I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'  beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie. 
DARRYL: Val. You made it. 
DARRYL: Wade said we could do the whole country in three months. 
DARRYL: Wanna be with you night and day. Darryl and 
DARRYL: Way braver! You Braveheart, man. 
DARRYL: We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this? 
DARRYL: We can look into it. 
DARRYL: We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it s not just a Philly play, so get 
DARRYL: We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled... 
DARRYL: We good. 
DARRYL: We got an offer on the table. 
DARRYL: We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen. 
DARRYL: We livin  like rock stars. I m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities. 
DARRYL: We re in play, baby. 
DARRYL: We should play it. 
DARRYL: We wanted to give you something. 
DARRYL: We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder 
DARRYL: Welcome to the warehouse. Group 
DARRYL: We'll go after Darth then. 
DARRYL: Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers. 
DARRYL: Well you lost zero pounds.   No change. On the bright side you gained zero pounds. 
DARRYL: Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid. 
DARRYL: Well,  those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us? 
DARRYL: Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you. 
DARRYL: Well, it s been great. 
DARRYL: Well, it's effective. 
DARRYL: Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise. 
DARRYL: Well, shall we make it a little interesting? 
DARRYL: Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay, and we're shippin' more now than we ever have. 
DARRYL: Well, yeah, what can I say, a player s gotta play. 
DARRYL: We're friends. We're friends. 
DARRYL: We're going skating. 
DARRYL: We're loading at one. 
DARRYL: Were the boxes near each other? 
DARRYL: We're the ones that got to clean that up! 
DARRYL: What are you doing with my lunch? 
DARRYL: What college did you go to Mike? 
DARRYL: What do we have here? 
DARRYL: What do you mean  they left ? 
DARRYL: What do you say? 
DARRYL: What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies... 
DARRYL: What else could you possibly be forgetting? 
DARRYL: What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time? 
DARRYL: What have you done for me? 
DARRYL: What have you done for me? 
DARRYL: What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel? 
DARRYL: What kind of chicks are you going to meet there? 
DARRYL: What kind of job? 
DARRYL: What the hell is wrong with you? 
DARRYL: What up? 
DARRYL: What you need flour for, Jim? 
DARRYL: WHAT!? 
DARRYL: What, you don't like the blues? 
DARRYL: What? 
DARRYL: What? 
DARRYL: What? 
DARRYL: What? 
DARRYL: What? 
DARRYL: What? 
DARRYL: What?  How about yesterday? 
DARRYL: What? All right! 
DARRYL: What? I can't hear you. 
DARRYL: What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something? 
DARRYL: What? Must ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual. 
DARRYL: What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening? 
DARRYL: What? You making bread? 
DARRYL: What?! Really? 
DARRYL: What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse? 
DARRYL: What's his name? 
DARRYL: What's his name? 
DARRYL: What's it say?

DARRYL: What's up, Roy? 
DARRYL: What's wrong with a level playing field? 
DARRYL: What's wrong with you? 
DARRYL: When did I get so fat? 
DARRYL: When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head. 
DARRYL: When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won   playing my birthday. 
DARRYL: Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind. 
DARRYL: Which me am I gonna be today? 
DARRYL: Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room. 
DARRYL: Who cares?

DARRYL: Who knows? 
DARRYL: Who needs it? 
DARRYL: Who? HCT Member 
DARRYL: Whoa! Hold on. 
DARRYL: Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.

DARRYL: Who's it? 
DARRYL: Why can't I just... tell you? 
DARRYL: Why do you wanna work here? Male Applicant 
DARRYL: Why don t you come along and tell him yourself? 
DARRYL: Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's. 
DARRYL: Why is the forklift in the wall? 
DARRYL: Why would you think a lady is me? 
DARRYL: Why, did you meet someone? 
DARRYL: Why? 
DARRYL: Why? 
DARRYL: Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood? 
DARRYL: Woah-Oh! Haven t been in one of these in forever. 
DARRYL: Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby? 
DARRYL: Would you just fire me, man? 
DARRYL: Wow. Man. I hope he doesn t regret it. 
DARRYL: Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it. 
DARRYL: Wrap it up, Gabe. 
DARRYL: Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen. 
DARRYL: Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship. 
DARRYL: Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors... 
DARRYL: Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing. 
DARRYL: Yeah where is it? 
DARRYL: Yeah! Da na na na na. 
DARRYL: YEAH! Da na na na na. 
DARRYL: Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone. 
DARRYL: Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for. 
DARRYL: Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet. 
DARRYL: Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton. 
DARRYL: Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar. 
DARRYL: Yeah, I guess  
DARRYL: Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame.  No offense. You going, Toby? 
DARRYL: Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself. 
DARRYL: Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin  much better. This soda. This is mine. 
DARRYL: Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California!  
DARRYL: Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say. 
DARRYL: Yeah, it's a little much. 
DARRYL: Yeah, I've seen Santa. 
DARRYL: Yeah, Jim. 
DARRYL: Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right? 
DARRYL: Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I m switching over. 
DARRYL: Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right? 
DARRYL: Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes? 
DARRYL: Yeah, she ended things. 
DARRYL: Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in. 
DARRYL: Yeah, that s crazy. 
DARRYL: Yeah, the booth is lame without it. 
DARRYL: Yeah, this isn't happening. 
DARRYL: Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here. 
DARRYL: Yeah, we did it. 
DARRYL: Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night . I have to sing it.  We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

DARRYL: Yeah. 
DARRYL: Yeah. 
DARRYL: Yeah. 
DARRYL: Yeah. 
DARRYL: Yeah. 
DARRYL: Yeah. 
DARRYL: Yeah. 
DARRYL: Yeah.

DARRYL: Yes sir.  
DARRYL: Yes sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me 
DARRYL: Yes sir. Thanks. 
DARRYL: Yes!  Right here. You are a naughty girl! 
DARRYL: Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh   I wrote some down. There you go.  Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me!  
DARRYL: Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page. 
DARRYL: Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die! 
DARRYL: Yes, Shawn Marion. 
DARRYL: Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced. 
DARRYL: Yes, this is the one. 
DARRYL: Yes, yes, yes. 
DARRYL: Yes. 
DARRYL: Yes. 
DARRYL: Yes. 
DARRYL: Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them. 
DARRYL: Yes. How did he do? 
DARRYL: Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you. 
DARRYL: Yo. 
DARRYL: You a baby daddy? 
DARRYL: You accept these terms? 
DARRYL: You can owe me. 
DARRYL: You chose one thing? 
DARRYL: You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food. 
DARRYL: You could be. 
DARRYL: You could go downstairs and ask them? 
DARRYL: You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people.   
DARRYL: You did good. Real good. 
DARRYL: You didn't feel like he was hiding something? 
DARRYL: You didn't have to boo him. 
DARRYL: You don t have to say it if you re doing it. 
DARRYL: You done? 
DARRYL: You don't say? 
DARRYL: You feel connected to his baby over there? 
DARRYL: You feel connected to this?   
DARRYL: You got it. Pick it up. Take it out. 
DARRYL: You gotta stop texting me so much. 
DARRYL: You guys lost four pounds. 
DARRYL: You have one more free throw shoot. Come on. 
DARRYL: You haven't even introduced yourself. 
DARRYL: You just made a good idea, a great idea. 
DARRYL: You just said you hated it. 
DARRYL: You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage. 
DARRYL: You know this would not happen if we had a union. 
DARRYL: You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...' 
DARRYL: You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked. 
DARRYL: You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting. 
DARRYL: You know, get it right. 
DARRYL: You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV. 
DARRYL: You log in sales at ten different times. If you log  em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching. 
DARRYL: You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing. 
DARRYL: You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals? 
DARRYL: You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery? Female 
DARRYL: You missed a spot. Drive Thru 
DARRYL: You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no. 
DARRYL: You need to get back on top. 
DARRYL: You popped one kernel. 
DARRYL: You re a bad man Andy Bernard. 
DARRYL: You re gonna po  mouth 
DARRYL: You ready for me? 
DARRYL: You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town? 
DARRYL: You really re-did Andy's office, huh? 
DARRYL: You remember? Yes! 
DARRYL: You said no to this one! 
DARRYL: You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently. 
DARRYL: You should stop calling yourself "baby daddy." 
DARRYL: You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird. 
DARRYL: You talk to Wade and Colin? 
DARRYL: You too... Darryl. 
DARRYL: You wanna make me happy? Huh? 
DARRYL: You want me to invite Matt? 
DARRYL: You want to dance? 
DARRYL: You want to hold me, to see how you feel? 
DARRYL: You went to Cornell? 
DARRYL: You! 
DARRYL: Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating. 
DARRYL: Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val? 
DARRYL: Your mom? 
DARRYL: You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas. 
DARRYL: You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport. 
DARRYL: You're not as scary as Book Face, over there. 
DARRYL: You're not staying? 
DARRYL: You're not talking... triple digits? 
DARRYL: You're on your own, Mike.  
DARRYL: You're on. 
DARRYL: You're right, it's better than you! It's us!  Dunder Mifflin. Andy, Creed, Kevin, 
DARRYL: You're the tutorial. 
DARRYL: You've got a booger bubble going on there. 
DARRYL: Yup. 
DARRYL: Yup. 
DARYL:  Consider it a WUPHF in person.  
DARYL:  Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky... 
DARYL:  Take a shot. 
DARYL:  Where you been? 
DARYL: Absolutely. 
DARYL: And I'd blow your mind. 
DARYL: Andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters... I'd choose you. 
DARYL: Are you serious? 
DARYL: Cable's out. 
DARYL: Hey! What are you fellas doing up here? Warehouse guy 
DARYL: Hey. 
DARYL: I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time. 
DARYL: I impressed her with my good ideas. 
DARYL: I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there. 
DARYL: I wish, but uh- Warehouse guy 
DARYL: If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right? 
DARYL: Is it any particular branch of Washington University? 
DARYL: It's not that we don't believe in the company, We don't believe in you. 
DARYL: Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it? 
DARYL: Matt's a pretty good-looking dude, don't you think? 
DARYL: Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days. 
DARYL: Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs. 
DARYL: Not bad, huh? 
DARYL: Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television. 
DARYL: Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom. All right then, uh, let me get to it. Warehouse guy 
DARYL: Really? 'Cause I think maybe I saw five. 
DARYL: So this new computer you found in the warehouse. 
DARYL: Thank you. 
DARYL: The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in. 
DARYL: They only want it for the initials. 
DARYL: Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it. 
DARYL: W.U.P.H.F. 
DARYL: What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School? 
DARYL: Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff. 
DARYL: Yeah, sell! 
DARYL: Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse. 
DARYL: You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell. 
DAVID:   Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true? 
DAVID:   Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away. 
DAVID:   Michael, what the hell is going on here? 
DAVID:   Michael. 
DAVID:   Michael. 
DAVID:   Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though! 
DAVID:   We are gonna call you back guys.   What is going on here? 
DAVID:   Yeah, finish up. 
DAVID:  "Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is." 
DAVID:  Andy Bernard. 
DAVID:  Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship. 
DAVID:  By the way, Oscar says 'hi'  
DAVID:  Michael, I am calling--- 
DAVID:  Oh, Michael? 
DAVID:  Okay.  
DAVID:  So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty. But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  Great! I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here. 
DAVID:  This is David. 
DAVID:  Well, I have some very exciting news. 
DAVID:  Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it. 
DAVID:  What you doing? 
DAVID:  Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there s a crisis -- the more I think about it -- 
DAVID: $12,000. 
DAVID: ...that's a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  Kendall. Ugh. So, first up... 
DAVID: ...what do you think about Michael Scott? 
DAVID: A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure. 
DAVID: About 5,000. 
DAVID: Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please. 
DAVID: Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction. 
DAVID: Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company. 
DAVID: Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there. 
DAVID: Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second? 
DAVID: Alan will be out too. All of us. 
DAVID: All in caps. Do you know what 911 means? 
DAVID: All right. 
DAVID: Alright Dwight. This is huge. 
DAVID: Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do? 
DAVID: Alright, well I should go. Thanks for this. You've given me a lot to think about. Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak. 
DAVID: Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet--- 
DAVID: Am I missing something? 
DAVID: And that, uh, questionnaire. Sorry to make you fill that thing out... 
DAVID: Andy Bernard! 
DAVID: Andy! 
DAVID: Andy. 
DAVID: Andy. 
DAVID: Any jobs now? 
DAVID: Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites? 
DAVID: Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings. 
DAVID: But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good. We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year. Insolvent. So, well... You know what? I'm sorry, I have to run. But we will talk soon, OK? 
DAVID: But it's very possible- 
DAVID: But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well? 
DAVID: But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important. 
DAVID: Cheese platter? 
DAVID: Co-manager and Co-manager. See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs. 
DAVID: Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor  . There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business. 
DAVID: Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, "is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?" 
DAVID: David  
DAVID: Do you realize what you're asking for here? You're talking about salary plus health benefits-- 
DAVID: Dunder Mifflin.  Now  why would I want that? It s worth half of what it was three years ago. 
DAVID: Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs. 
DAVID: Dwight. 
DAVID: Erin, is Michael around? 
DAVID: Ever, ever... 
DAVID: Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in. Teddy 
DAVID: Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out. 
DAVID: Fine. What is going on? 
DAVID: Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic. 
DAVID: Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive. 
DAVID: God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes. 
DAVID: Good luck! 
DAVID: Good work. 
DAVID: Good.  
DAVID: Goodbye Michael. 
DAVID: Goodbye, Michael.   
DAVID: Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They ve apparently just dropped the supplier they ve been with for the last ten years. . 
DAVID: Has it? 
DAVID: Hello everyone. 
DAVID: Hello. Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business. And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback. 
DAVID: Here's the situation. Your company is four weeks old. I know this business. I know what suppliers are charging. I know you can't be making very much money. I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way. I'm sure you're scared. Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get. 
DAVID: Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time. 
DAVID: Herrow! Herrow! 
DAVID: Hey guys, long time. 
DAVID: Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool. But it only works if everyone's on board. 
DAVID: Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you? 
DAVID: Hey Sweetie, what is it? 
DAVID: Hey, oh, okay. Wait. 
DAVID: Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late. Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet. 
DAVID: Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again. 
DAVID: Hi Michael how are you? 
DAVID: Hi, everyone. 
DAVID: Hi. Uh, look it's no secret-- 
DAVID: Hmm. 
DAVID: Hmmm. 
DAVID: Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight.   
DAVID: How could you not know Michael? 
DAVID: How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic? 
DAVID: How did you get here, Michael? 
DAVID: How do you think you function here in New York? 
DAVID: How was the ride? 
DAVID: How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin? 
DAVID: Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it. 
DAVID: I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate. 
DAVID: I am gone. 
DAVID: I am not firing Charles. He is very valuable. 
DAVID: I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know. 
DAVID: I believe we put you in charge. 
DAVID: I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer. 
DAVID: I do. 
DAVID: I don't have any ideas for you there. 
DAVID: I don't know 
DAVID: I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan. 
DAVID: I don't know. I mean, what can you do? 
DAVID: I don't think so. 
DAVID: I don't understand, is anyone hurt? 
DAVID: I find that extraordinarily surprising. 
DAVID: I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me. 
DAVID: I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday. 
DAVID: I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute?   
DAVID: I see. 
DAVID: I thought you liked Jim? 
DAVID: I want to tell you about a business idea I have. 
DAVID: I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that. 
DAVID: I, I - It's a tough one. 
DAVID: I'll be fired. 
DAVID: I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for. 
DAVID: I'll get to that in a second, Andy. 
DAVID: I'll give it my best shot, Michael. 
DAVID: I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton. 
DAVID: I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents. 
DAVID: I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up. 
DAVID: I'm really looking forward to our interview. 
DAVID: I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch. Woman from 
DAVID: In the middle of a work day? 
DAVID: Insurance, taxes, social security for three people. This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand. You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out. 
DAVID: Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch? 
DAVID: Is this why you're calling me? 
DAVID: Isn't our interview tomorrow? 
DAVID: It is always a treat when our paths cross. 
DAVID: It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy. 
DAVID: It'll be ok. 
DAVID: It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job, right? 
DAVID: It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying.   And thanks for coming in. 
DAVID: It's not. 
DAVID: It's not. 
DAVID: I've been wondering that myself lately. We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured. Jim, can you come in with us please? 
DAVID: Jan is out of town right now. 
DAVID: Jan, glad you could make it. 
DAVID: Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview--- 
DAVID: Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second. 
DAVID: Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position. 
DAVID: Jim, good! You should hear this too. 
DAVID: Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier. If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion. 
DAVID: Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him. You think they'd be up for hearing an offer? 
DAVID: Just let me know. 
DAVID: Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife? 
DAVID: Keep it up, son. 
DAVID: Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house. 
DAVID: Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy. 
DAVID: Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team. 
DAVID: Look, this is important, Michael. 
DAVID: Look, this is very serious offense. We have cause to fire you. 
DAVID: Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you. 
DAVID: Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works. So congratulations. 
DAVID: Michael- 
DAVID: Michael-- 
DAVID: Michael, good to see you! 
DAVID: Michael, I have never- 
DAVID: Michael, I really don't know what's going on  down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit. 
DAVID: Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer. 
DAVID: Michael, is everyone okay? 
DAVID: Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier. 
DAVID: Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind. 
DAVID: Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME. 
DAVID: Michael. 
DAVID: Michael. 
DAVID: Michael. I am very sorry. 
DAVID: Michael. Listen- 
DAVID: Michael... 
DAVID: Michael? 
DAVID: Michael? 
DAVID: Michael? 
DAVID: Michael? 
DAVID: Might have hi--- OK, what firm? 
DAVID: Mmhmm. 
DAVID: My wife? 
DAVID: Nice to meet you. 
DAVID: No! No, and congratulations. 
DAVID: No, ah it's okay Michael. We got it. 
DAVID: No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It s someone new but she didn t catch her name. 
DAVID: No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac.  Did I say that? 
DAVID: No, no. 
DAVID: No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. .  Ohh. 
DAVID: No, we're letting Jan go. 
DAVID: No, we're not giving you the job. 
DAVID: No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on. 
DAVID: No. 
DAVID: No. 
DAVID: No. 
DAVID: No. 
DAVID: No. 
DAVID: No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael. 
DAVID: No. No dogs. 
DAVID: No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise. 
DAVID: No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael. 
DAVID: Not without cause, Michael. 
DAVID: Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up- 
DAVID: Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there. 
DAVID: Of course I do. 
DAVID: Oh, great. I've been meaning to thank you by the way. You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget? That is nice work.  So, let me ask you a question right off the bat. What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager? 
DAVID: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
DAVID: Oh, Michael. 
DAVID: Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work. 
DAVID: Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li . That's what it sounds like. 
DAVID: Oh. Yes. Very good. 
DAVID: OK, Michael. 
DAVID: OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes. 
DAVID: OK, was it Dwight? 
DAVID: Ok. 
DAVID: OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to... 
DAVID: Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing.  Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks.  Picks it up! 
DAVID: Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him. 
DAVID: Okay! 
DAVID: Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy- 
DAVID: Okay, I have to go. 
DAVID: Okay, I will look at it Monday. 
DAVID: Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this.   
DAVID: Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room? 
DAVID: Okay, Michael. 
DAVID: Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000. Hmm? $60,0000. Michael? 
DAVID: Okay, uh. Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job. 
DAVID: Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside. Take your time. 
DAVID: Okay. 
DAVID: Okay. 
DAVID: Okay. 
DAVID: Okay. 
DAVID: Okay. And your strengths? 
DAVID: Okay. Deal. Okay? 
DAVID: Okay. Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend? 
DAVID: Okay. Please continue. 
DAVID: Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but... 
DAVID: Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So... long haul. Where do you see yourself in ten years? 
DAVID: Okay? 
DAVID: Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you? 
DAVID: Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please? 
DAVID: Pam's not a salesperson. 
DAVID: Please do not text anybody, now, Michael. 
DAVID: Please do. 
DAVID: Pleasure. 
DAVID: Probable. 
DAVID: Really?   Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.  
DAVID: Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work! You smoke constantly in your office. You spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days. Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you used to--- 
DAVID: Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael. Ryan is-- 
DAVID: Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe. 
DAVID: Shh. 
DAVID: Shh. I'm not gonna fire you. 
DAVID: So glad you could make it. 
DAVID: So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job. 
DAVID: So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right? 
DAVID: So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer. We can finally put this whole thing behind us? Hmm? 
DAVID: So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch? 
DAVID: So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim? Michael 
DAVID: Stephanie, can you hop off please? 
DAVID: Suck it. That's what it's called. 
DAVID: Sure. 
DAVID: Thank you for coming. 
DAVID: Thank you Jim. 
DAVID: Thanks for comin' in, Michael. 
DAVID: Thanks Jim. 
DAVID: Thanks very much. 
DAVID: Thanks, Michael. 
DAVID: That's not exactly- 
DAVID: That's not necessary. 
DAVID: That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It. 
DAVID: That's too bad. 
DAVID: That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that. 
DAVID: The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable. 
DAVID: There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me. 
DAVID: There is no plan. 
DAVID: There's an official announcement, a few details to be- 
DAVID: They did? 
DAVID: Things not going so well there? 
DAVID: This is a very very bad time. 
DAVID: This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal. 
DAVID: This is off the record. 
DAVID: This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch. 
DAVID: This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you. 
DAVID: Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside.  Outside. 
DAVID: Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you. 
DAVID: Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy. 
DAVID: Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out. Mrs. 
DAVID: Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers? 
DAVID: Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today... Man from 
DAVID: Uh, you already have a new receptionist-- 
DAVID: Uh. 
DAVID: Um  I m in the middle of a piano lesson. 
DAVID: Ummm... okay, here's the thing though. The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you. I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer. We may have to replace him. 
DAVID: Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers.   Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is. 
DAVID: Very good. 
DAVID: Was it Jim? 
DAVID: Was it the sales department? 
DAVID: Watch it Andy! 
DAVID: We are even...now. Understand? Got it? 
DAVID: We didn't ask you to do that. 
DAVID: We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff. 
DAVID: We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that? 
DAVID: Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch. 
DAVID: Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song. 
DAVID: We'll bring them both in. 
DAVID: Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss... 
DAVID: Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus. 
DAVID: Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . . 
DAVID: Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file. 
DAVID: Well, okay. Great to meet you. 
DAVID: We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people. 
DAVID: We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch. Man from 
DAVID: What about Jim? Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position? 
DAVID: What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, "oh, this would be really funny." 
DAVID: What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole. 
DAVID: What do you think we could be doing better? 
DAVID: What gave you that idea? 
DAVID: What say we do. 
DAVID: What the hell? 
DAVID: What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now? 
DAVID: What? 
DAVID: What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael? 
DAVID: Where are you working? 
DAVID: Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen? 
DAVID: Why don t you come in?  
DAVID: Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great. 
DAVID: Yeah big time, yeah. 
DAVID: Yeah! 
DAVID: Yeah! 
DAVID: Yeah! 
DAVID: Yeah! 
DAVID: Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll... 
DAVID: Yeah! Teddy! 
DAVID: Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy! 
DAVID: Yeah, yeah. 
DAVID: Yeah. 
DAVID: Yeah. 
DAVID: Yeah. 
DAVID: Yeah. 
DAVID: Yeah. 
DAVID: Yeah. 
DAVID: Yeah.   
DAVID: Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do- 
DAVID: Yeah? 
DAVID: Yeah? 
DAVID: Yeah? 
DAVID: Yep. 
DAVID: Yep. 
DAVID: Yep. 
DAVID: Yes Michael, what is so urgent? 
DAVID: Yes, as we've discussed- 
DAVID: Yes. 
DAVID: Yes. 
DAVID: Yes. 
DAVID: Yes. 
DAVID: Yes. 
DAVID: Yes. 
DAVID: Yes. 
DAVID: Yes. 
DAVID: You are on very- Hey, very thin ice. 
DAVID: You can't do that these days. You can't. 
DAVID: You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan? 
DAVID: You have to get along with Toby. 
DAVID: You hungry? I'm just having lunch. 
DAVID: You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great. Keep after it, but I gotta run. 
DAVID: You know, I just want to address everyone first. 
DAVID: You look great. 
DAVID: You made a joke? 
DAVID: You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that. 
DAVID: You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting. 
DAVID: You understand this is a very serious situation. 
DAVID: You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue? 
DAVID: You weren't supposed to tell anyone Michael. 
DAVID: Your company cannot be worth that much. 
DAVID: You're back together. 
DAVID: You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know. 
DAVID: You've been in the Scranton branch a long time.  What have you liked most about that place? 
DAVID: You-you don't like it. 
DAVIS: Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he ll go,  eee.  
DAVIS: Like that. 
DAVIS: Stanley, what is going on here? 
DAVIS: That s Benji in the middle. 
DAVIS: Very special little boy. 
DEAGNELO: Wooo! Yeah!   Okay, again. 
DEALER: Five. 
DEALER: Flip them. 
DEALER: No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in. 
DEALER: Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir. 
DEALER: The point is four. Shooter, roll it. Four! 
DEAN: I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall. 
DEAN: You can t just sit here and cry. 
DEANGELO/MICHAEL:  Sorry... 
DEANGELO/MICHAEL:  Summer! 
DEANGELO:  
DEANGELO:  
DEANGELO:  
DEANGELO:  
DEANGELO:  And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring. 
DEANGELO:  Deangelo!  See what I did there? That's what you need to do.  It's that little English. The British are coming. 
DEANGELO:  Drink some soap! 
DEANGELO:  Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean! 
DEANGELO:  Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now. 
DEANGELO:  Feel that connection? Don't move your head. Please. Thank you. Oh! Big hand for Phyllis!  That took a lot of guts!  Ho! I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something. 
DEANGELO:  Hey dudes! 
DEANGELO:  Hey Jim. 
DEANGELO:  Hey! 
DEANGELO:  Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela? 
DEANGELO:  Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or...? 
DEANGELO:  I won't... I don't know her. 
DEANGELO:  I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job.  But I can say 
DEANGELO:  I'll help you. 
DEANGELO:  I'm not going in there. 
DEANGELO:  I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me. 
DEANGELO:  Is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knockoff? 
DEANGELO:  Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you... 
DEANGELO:  Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here.  
DEANGELO:  Me mo. Me mo. 
DEANGELO:  Measure your life in love! 
DEANGELO:  Michael, I'm very, very bad. 
DEANGELO:  Now that's funny! That's funny! You walk much? 
DEANGELO:  Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around! 
DEANGELO:  Oh, you mean Michael Jordan? 
DEANGELO:  Okay whatever. 
DEANGELO:  okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What?  Hmm? 
DEANGELO:  Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby. 
DEANGELO:  says to bartender  Droswip. Droswip. 
DEANGELO:  Tablab. 
DEANGELO:  That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time. 
DEANGELO:  THE DUNDIES! 
DEANGELO:  There he is! Got ya coffee.  
DEANGELO:  Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake.  I for one love the corners.  Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch.  No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this.  What am I doing?  Come on DeAngelo!  
DEANGELO:  What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let's get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way? 
DEANGELO:  What's up? 
DEANGELO:  Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care.  You'll never guess, we did it! 
DEANGELO:  You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success? 
DEANGELO:  You know what, I have to go to the bathroom. 
DEANGELO:  You're getting nut particles all in the air! 
DEANGELO:  You're not gonna take all these toys are you? 
DEANGELO: Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups. 
DEANGELO: Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn't it? 
DEANGELO: Alright? 
DEANGELO: And it really isn't. 
DEANGELO: And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket? 
DEANGELO: Are you serious? Who feels this way? 
DEANGELO: Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five? 
DEANGELO: Because I believe in you. 
DEANGELO: Best whale 
DEANGELO: Billy Crystal? 
DEANGELO: Can I help you? 
DEANGELO: Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a- 
DEANGELO: 'Cause if you do now's the time. 
DEANGELO: Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair. 
DEANGELO: Colorado! The sunshine state. 
DEANGELO: Congratulations! 
DEANGELO: Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper!  
DEANGELO: Dead man walking. 
DEANGELO: Deangelo Vickers. 
DEANGELO: Deangelo's open! 
DEANGELO: Did that? Did that just happen?!  We should.. we should write a movie or something! I'm serious! 
DEANGELO: Do you believe in me, Phyllis? 
DEANGELO: Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar? 
DEANGELO: Doing some skiing? 
DEANGELO: Don't thank me! Hey, don't thank me, guy! Okay? And I don't care if you like it. 
DEANGELO: Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you? 
DEANGELO: Dwight, what's your take? 
DEANGELO: Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant? 
DEANGELO: Excuse me. Hello? You running late? 
DEANGELO: Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys? 
DEANGELO: Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again!  You hear me?!  You feel that energy? 
DEANGELO: Gimme that dog! That's not your dog!  Yeah! Again. 
DEANGELO: Go do it by yourself, get Ryan. 
DEANGELO: Guys. Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea. 
DEANGELO: Hello! 
DEANGELO: Hello!  How are you sir? 
DEANGELO: Hello? 
DEANGELO: Here's the great thing about the southwest; there's so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen. 
DEANGELO: Hey Ry. Your department's killing it, baby.  
DEANGELO: Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can't even look at you. 
DEANGELO: Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh? 
DEANGELO: Hit me again.  
DEANGELO: Hold on, hold on one second.  I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN'S ROOM! 
DEANGELO: Hold on. 
DEANGELO: How long have you... 
DEANGELO: I am ready. 
DEANGELO: I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune... 
DEANGELO: I am wearing a grey suit, red tie. 
DEANGELO: I can just run over to the gas station. 
DEANGELO: I can't.  
DEANGELO: I did not. 
DEANGELO: I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200.  
DEANGELO: I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream. You either like it or you don't.  That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays. Alright? Clear? Any questions? 
DEANGELO: I hear your voice, I see your lips moving. 
DEANGELO: I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I've got to start doing some managing at some point. 
DEANGELO: I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on. 
DEANGELO: I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on. 
DEANGELO: I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts. 
DEANGELO: I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me. 
DEANGELO: I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled 'Babys I Don't Care About.' 
DEANGELO: I think a change would be nice. 
DEANGELO: I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it.  
DEANGELO: I will be in the break room. 
DEANGELO: I... I'm adequete. I'm half as good as you. 
DEANGELO: I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week. 
DEANGELO: I'm an olympics nut. 
DEANGELO: I'm at the bar too. 
DEANGELO: I'm at the bar. The bar that's located in the lobby of the hotel. 
DEANGELO: I'm no MJ. I can do his dunk. From the free throw line. 
DEANGELO: Internally, for office use  where do we get our paper from? Do we go - 
DEANGELO: Is this an employee of ours? 
DEANGELO: Is this true, Ryan? 
DEANGELO: It blows away Vermont in the fall. 
DEANGELO: It reminds me of Katrina. 
DEANGELO: It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? 17, 18 hundo? 
DEANGELO: It's too murky. I like Ryan. You seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way. 
DEANGELO: Jim! Come on in. 
DEANGELO: Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott? 
DEANGELO: Keep it up. 
DEANGELO: Kev's got me pegged.  
DEANGELO: Let's not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy. 
DEANGELO: Let's rip it up homes.  
DEANGELO: Listen. I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the People" on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want. 
DEANGELO: Little click... 
DEANGELO: Man, you're smart.  Oh, hey! Hi! Hello. Welcome. Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield. This is everyone. 
DEANGELO: Maybe I just need to look into my heart.  DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott.  
DEANGELO: Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving.  Bring it in, come on.  Ok.  
DEANGELO: Meee Mo, Mee! 
DEANGELO: Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot. 
DEANGELO: Mmhmm. 
DEANGELO: Nah, that's 15. Yeah. 
DEANGELO: Neil Patrick Harris? 
DEANGELO: No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits. 
DEANGELO: No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight. 
DEANGELO: No one is listening to me! And I'm running out of time! 
DEANGELO: No one likes a money grubber. 
DEANGELO: No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable. 
DEANGELO: No, no, no, I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better? 
DEANGELO: No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before. 
DEANGELO: No, that's definitely a knockoff. You can feel the center of gravity's off. Feel that.  What do you think? 
DEANGELO: No. Because the entire state smells like Earth. 
DEANGELO: No. Never. Can someone please throw me a fifth ball? If you dare!  Incoming! And we're on! Remember, nothing's impossible! Phyllis, where's Phyllis? 
DEANGELO: Not a coffee guy, I take it. 
DEANGELO: Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay... 
DEANGELO: Not while I'm driving. 
DEANGELO: Oh good! 
DEANGELO: Oh no! 
DEANGELO: Oh yeah. I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet? 320? 
DEANGELO: Oh yes. 
DEANGELO: Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim. Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist. I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not. I am not a sexist. Raise your hand if you have a vagina.  Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina.  Yeah, yeah. Okay. Just about everyone. What about Deangelo's hand? Oh wow. He's got 'em both up.  Yeah. Uh huh.  Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men. Okay? Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens. 
DEANGELO: Oh, she'll do. She'll do just fine. 
DEANGELO: Oh, that'd be great, thank you Stanley! 
DEANGELO: Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can't wait to hear the punchline. 
DEANGELO: Oh.  That was... let's see, where's my replacement? Where's the guy I'm replacing? Why don't I look to the left? He's sitting right there!  
DEANGELO: Ohh. 
DEANGELO: Ohhhh no. 
DEANGELO: Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close. 
DEANGELO: Ok, me too. 
DEANGELO: Ok, then, powwows then, fine. 
DEANGELO: Ok. What is the Native American girl's name? 
DEANGELO: Okay, fine I'll hold it. 
DEANGELO: Okay, I don't have time for this he said-she said. 
DEANGELO: Okay, Jimmy, this is for you. Show you that anything is possible. 
DEANGELO: Okay. We'll keep that in mind. Alright, ladies, back to the game. 
DEANGELO: Okay? I'm gonna win you over. 
DEANGELO: Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff.  Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it. 
DEANGELO: Oscar? 
DEANGELO: Put it with the rest. 
DEANGELO: Right! Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients. 
DEANGELO: Right. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it. 
DEANGELO: Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line? 
DEANGELO: So what's up? 
DEANGELO: So, coasting time is officially over. Big changes are comin', and they're comin' fast. If you don't like 'em, this is called a door. You can walk right through it. Alright. I'm not here to be your friend. I like my life outside of this place. I live to leave at 5. Change number 
DEANGELO: Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap? Angela? 
DEANGELO: Sorry gang. Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car. It's not. 
DEANGELO: Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments. You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued, why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls?  Prepare... to go into the danger zone.  
DEANGELO: Sounds very interesting, thank you. 
DEANGELO: Stone cold seriously. 
DEANGELO: Stop, hitting me. 
DEANGELO: Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass. 
DEANGELO: Thank you. 
DEANGELO: Thank you. That's my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this. 
DEANGELO: Thanks. 
DEANGELO: That is a s-- astute observation, Kevin. 
DEANGELO: That is insane, that is the right term. Let's get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend. 
DEANGELO: That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a- 
DEANGELO: That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute. 
DEANGELO: That's nice.  How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it.  You okay? 
DEANGELO: That's stupid.  
DEANGELO: That's the way it goes. 
DEANGELO: THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING... 
DEANGELO: THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!  
DEANGELO: THE DUNDIES! 
DEANGELO: The moms and the troops. 
DEANGELO: They are trying to figure me out. And I don't like it. Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I want to hear, I'm not gonna care. 
DEANGELO: They say he's going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke.  No, I hate this, I hate it so much.  Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie.  Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan.  This is for you trashcan!  
DEANGELO: This did not happen. 
DEANGELO: This is also for the troops.  Doctor is in!  Ahhhh!  
DEANGELO: This is so weird! If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance... I-I fall apart. Obviously. 
DEANGELO: This was not, part of the job description! 
DEANGELO: To begginings and endings. 
DEANGELO: Try it once, you're hooked. That's my guess. 
DEANGELO: Try it without using your name. 
DEANGELO: Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta,  Get Him to the Dundies! 
DEANGELO: Uh, leave it at the door or...? 
DEANGELO: Uhhh, you sir!  Are we having fun tonight? 
DEANGELO: Uh-oh. Right? 
DEANGELO: We did it! 
DEANGELO: Well that's just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead. 
DEANGELO: Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own. 
DEANGELO: Well, I'd like to change it, actually. 
DEANGELO: Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition. 
DEANGELO: What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys! 
DEANGELO: What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine. 
DEANGELO: When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them. 
DEANGELO: Where were you on September 11th? 
DEANGELO: Which place? 
DEANGELO: Who am I doing this for? 
DEANGELO: Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh? What do you guys say? 
DEANGELO: Why do you use your name when you use the phone? 
DEANGELO: Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You've worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It's Lake Havasu time! 
DEANGELO: Woo. Glad he's not my boss. 
DEANGELO: Yeah sure. Let's make it a meeting.  
DEANGELO: Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you. Best seat in the house. 
DEANGELO: Yeah, I don't know. 
DEANGELO: Yeah, I got tons of time. This job's a joke. 
DEANGELO: Yeah, we'll set that up one day. 
DEANGELO: Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid. 
DEANGELO: Yes I am. 
DEANGELO: Yes, and this happens every...? 
DEANGELO: Yes, Pam. 
DEANGELO: Yes. 
DEANGELO: Yes. 
DEANGELO: Yes. 
DEANGELO: Yes. 
DEANGELO: Yes. Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes  yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes! 
DEANGELO: You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's. 
DEANGELO: You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I'm sorry. 
DEANGELO: You know what... straight up, why don't you like me? 
DEANGELO: You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair. 
DEANGELO: You know, it's funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going. 
DEANGELO: You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton? 
DEANGELO: Yup. 
DELIVERY: I'm supposed to deliver this one in person.  
DELIVERYMAN: Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert. 
DENAGELO:  Change it. 
DENNIS:  And I want to reach every demographic possible. 
DENNIS: Alright. Good. 
DENNIS: We re talking weeks here, not months, right? 
DEVON:  Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm going to be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell! 
DEVON: Creed's an idiot, you know that. 
DEVON: Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man. 
DEVON: No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time. 
DEVON: So you might not look like an idiot? 
DEVON: That's why I'm being fired? 
DEVON: This is unbelievable! 
DEVON: What! 
DIANE: And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the timeline here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin? 
DIANE: I'm sorry, what? 
DIANE: No wait, I don't understand. Who's on record on saying this? 
DIANE: No, uh, are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here? 
DIANE: Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, if that's okay with you? 
DIANE: That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica, is that correct? 
DIANE: Toby? 
DIANE: Um would you mind please just, uh, taking a quick look at, uh, this photograph please.  
DIANE: Wait, excuse me? 
DIANE: You know, I think they're, uh ready for us now. So.. 
DIGHT: Michael. 
DIRECTOR: And cut. We can fix the sound in post. 
DIRECTOR: Dude, we don't need you to go nude, OK? So just do the eyewash, Ok? That's all we're asking. 
DIRECTOR: Here we go. Rolling and... action! 
DIRECTOR: I don't know, just like you're reporting the news or something. Ok? 
DIRECTOR: Ok here you have just knocked over the beaker, the chemicals splashed in your eye. 
DIRECTOR: Ok, well maybe no smiling on this one. 
DIRECTOR: Ok. 
DIRECTOR: That's great. So what you're gonna do then is come over here to the eye washing station and then just kinda flush out your eyes. You know, get the chemicals out. Alright? 
DIRECTOR: The actor's crying. 
DIRECTOR: We are rolling and...action! 
DIRECTOR: What water special effect? 
DIRECTOR: Who was that? 
DIRECTOR: Yeah. 
DJ: Hey, uh. It's just you. Anything you want to hear? 
DJ: Okay.  
DJ: So, that's it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe. 
DO: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college. 
DO: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes. 
DOCTOR:  So, I'm ordering a CAT scan. 
DOCTOR: A head injury. 
DOCTOR: Does the skin look red and swollen? 
DOCTOR: Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father. 
DOCTOR: Not yet. 
DOCTOR: Okay. Really push this time, Pam. 
DOCTOR: Sir! Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Put it, put it out. 
DOCTOR: Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot. 
DOLL: 120, 180... 200. 
DONNA:  
DONNA:  Hello? 
DONNA:  Michael! 
DONNA:  Not bad. 
DONNA:  Oh, stop that. 
DONNA:  Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about. 
DONNA: And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you. 
DONNA: Bye. 
DONNA: Bye-bye! 
DONNA: Donna, hi. 
DONNA: Have you ever been to Vero Beach? 
DONNA: Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would... 
DONNA: Hi! 
DONNA: Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott. 
DONNA: How could you think I would cheat on you? 
DONNA: How do you know? 
DONNA: I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much.  Hey, you okay?  
DONNA: I don't have, uh, any other questions.  I'm just gonna... make my way down to... 
DONNA: I have a sense about these things. 
DONNA: I told you I like you. 
DONNA: I'm out of here. 
DONNA: I'm sor... 
DONNA: Is this... is this the best you can do right there? 
DONNA: Isn't that something? 
DONNA: It's like cool... "certified cool." I like how they say "certified." Like there's some consortium of...  Michael! 
DONNA: It's you. I'm married. 
DONNA: Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been? 
DONNA: Mm-hmm. 
DONNA: Mm-hmm. 
DONNA: No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested? 
DONNA: No, I bought them myself. 
DONNA: No, it's just in the lot, so... 
DONNA: No, y-you were... right. 
DONNA: Nope. I'm good, thanks. 
DONNA: Oh my God. 
DONNA: Oh my God.  
DONNA: Oh no. 
DONNA: Oh, Friday doesn't work. 
DONNA: Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then. 
DONNA: Oh, hi. You work for Michael. 
DONNA: Oh, I haven't tried those. No. 
DONNA: Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday. 
DONNA: Oh, yeah, thank you. 
DONNA: Oh. 
DONNA: Oh.  
DONNA: Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business,  where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like. 
DONNA: Okay. 
DONNA: Right. 
DONNA: Shoot. I'm working. 
DONNA: Steamtown Mall. 
DONNA: Thank you. 
DONNA: Thank you. 
DONNA: Thank you.  Hmm. 
DONNA: Thank you. Did I... get everything? 
DONNA: That's pathetic. 
DONNA: Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do? 
DONNA: Uh, Franklin Mills. 
DONNA: Ummm, no. 
DONNA: Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes? 
DONNA: Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering. 
DONNA: Well, won't you be at the concert? 
DONNA: We're going. 
DONNA: What, what do you mean? 
DONNA: When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak.  
DONNA: Who took the photo? 
DONNA: Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done. 
DONNA: Yeah, I think so. 
DONNA: Yeah, we should. 
DONNA: Yeah. 
DONNA: Yeah. 
DONNA: Yeah. 
DONNA: Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate. 
DONNA: Yes. 
DONNA: You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back. 
DONNA: You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there. 
DONNA: You look exactly alike. 
DONNA: You okay? 
DONNA: You stay away from me, or I'm calling security. 
DONNA: You want one? 
DONNA: You were right. 
DONNA: You were right.  I'm sorry. 
DONNA: You're welcome.  You're... welcome. 
DOUG:  So that was lunch, eh? Mcpherson troop, let's haul out. Rendezvous at Friendly's. 
DOUG: Davey. 
DOUG: I don't mean to bug, but do you know when those subs are due into port? I got a hungry bunch of Mcphersons over there. 
DOUG: I think maybe some blonde lady had her. 
DOUG: Smaller than me. 
DRIVER: Can't stop. We're on a schedule. 
DRIVER: Car seats eight. 
DRIVER: Maybe we'll stop in Tennesseee. It's not safe to talk to a driver. 
DRIVER: No, Mr. Irving called. Said he'd rather meet you at his private court. 
DRIVER: Stopping in Tennessee. 
DRIVER: The car seats eight. 
DRIVER: Yeah, take some home if you want. 
DRUMMER: Go Eagles!  
DUNDER: And he was, he was  at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm... uhh... Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys. 
DUNDER: And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later... Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club. 
DUNDER: And... 
DUNDER: Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction. 
DUNDER: I started this company in 1949. 
DUNDER: I'm 87. 
DUNDER: Michael Scott? 
DUNDER: Thank you everyone. 
DUNDER: Well I, I, I came here in a cab. 
DUNDER: Well, cou, could you get me another...  
DUNDER: Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy. 
DUNMIFF/SYS:  Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper. 
DUNMIFF/SYS:  Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples. 
DUNMIFF/SYS:  What is a Jim? 
DUNMIFF/SYS:  Who am I? 
DUNMIFF/SYS:  You beat me. You are the superior being. 
DUNMIFF/SYS:  You do look worried. 
DWIGHT.: Hello, Pam. 
DWIGHT: 
DWIGHT: 
DWIGHT:  
DWIGHT:  
DWIGHT:  
DWIGHT:  
DWIGHT:

DWIGHT:   
DWIGHT:   
DWIGHT:   
DWIGHT:   
DWIGHT:   
DWIGHT:   
DWIGHT:   
DWIGHT:   
DWIGHT:    lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy. 
DWIGHT:   "I state my regret." 
DWIGHT:   "We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our..."  I've got eight hours of this. Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe. Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard? I'm not insane.  "...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer." 
DWIGHT:   2, 3!  
DWIGHT:   Aah! 
DWIGHT:   Ah! 
DWIGHT:   Ahh. We done good in there, half pint. 
DWIGHT:   Alas, after much consideration and deliberation... 
DWIGHT:   All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy. 
DWIGHT:   Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no fire. It was only a simulation. 
DWIGHT:   Ayyyy! Jim, Pam, Michael and 
DWIGHT:   Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap.   Many happy returns.   
DWIGHT:   Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower! 
DWIGHT:   'Cause I've got this idea... 
DWIGHT:   Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out! 
DWIGHT:   Cornell.   
DWIGHT:   Damn it!   Dwight Schrute. 
DWIGHT:   Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you? 
DWIGHT:   Does anyone smell anything smoky? 
DWIGHT:   Don't get stuck on the barbed wire! 
DWIGHT:   Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child! 
DWIGHT:   Dwight Schrute. 
DWIGHT:   Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car. 
DWIGHT:   Fine. 
DWIGHT:   Frame him, for using drugs. 
DWIGHT:   Got it. 
DWIGHT:   Ha!   
DWIGHT:   Have a good trip. 
DWIGHT:   Hey Michael? 
DWIGHT:   Hey!  Look sharp!  Hey! Uh, Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute. Chad 
DWIGHT:   Hit it Andy! 
DWIGHT:   Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh!   Disappear. 
DWIGHT:   Hold me! 
DWIGHT:   How'd that get there? 
DWIGHT:   I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating.   That's on my side. 
DWIGHT:   I am the bait. 
DWIGHT:   I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise. 
DWIGHT:   I got her! 
DWIGHT:   I got it, I got it.   Michael & 
DWIGHT:   I need a soup spoon. 
DWIGHT:   I think you know. 
DWIGHT:   Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way. 
DWIGHT:   I'll call you back.   
DWIGHT:   I'm gonna need two able bodied men. 
DWIGHT:   Interview. 
DWIGHT:   It's firm. 
DWIGHT:   Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch. 
DWIGHT:   Knock, knock. 
DWIGHT:   Like clockwork. 
DWIGHT:   Michael.   Sorry. 
DWIGHT:   Michael. I can t believe you came. 
DWIGHT:   Mr. Schofield, please? 
DWIGHT:   No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist.   
DWIGHT:   Now, how can I help you? 
DWIGHT:   Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net. 
DWIGHT:   Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor? 
DWIGHT:   Okay, you've got one hour.   
DWIGHT:   Playtime is over! 
DWIGHT:   Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend."   "Tall" and "beets." 
DWIGHT:   Seems like you already know where. 
DWIGHT:   Shame, Jim. I expected more. 
DWIGHT:   She's not a virgin, you know. 
DWIGHT:   Sixty - forty. Hm?   I'll drive. 
DWIGHT:   Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!  That means you can't make me do squat. 
DWIGHT:   Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em. 
DWIGHT:   That is all sir, you may go. 
DWIGHT:   That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim! 
DWIGHT:   There. Take those home to your wife. 
DWIGHT:   Trade seats with me. 
DWIGHT:   Ugh. 
DWIGHT:   We will ask the questions! 
DWIGHT:   Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me. 
DWIGHT:   What did you do? 
DWIGHT:   What do you need from me? 
DWIGHT:   What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets? 
DWIGHT:   When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there? 
DWIGHT:   While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications.   I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal.   Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night. 
DWIGHT:   Who is that monkey? 
DWIGHT:   Wh--what are you doing? 
DWIGHT:   Women's urinals... uh... 
DWIGHT:   Yeah! 
DWIGHT:   Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin. His name is Toby Flenderson   and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America. I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is Andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon. Police Officer 
DWIGHT:   Yes. 
DWIGHT:   You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them? 
DWIGHT:   You have to write my suggestions down, too. 
DWIGHT:   You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom. 
DWIGHT:   You set a date? 
DWIGHT:   You were dressed as Willy Wonka so... 
DWIGHT:  "Abdomen. Menses." 
DWIGHT:  "Hope this helps. -Jim" Nice! 
DWIGHT:  "Little boy blue and the man in the moon." 
DWIGHT:  "Ok" I can run it? 
DWIGHT:  "We" don't. 
DWIGHT:  ... Marilyn Monroe! Dwight and 
DWIGHT:  ... Schrute.  
DWIGHT:  ...did slowly go by... and feed... them on your dreams... 
DWIGHT:  ...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you... 
DWIGHT:  A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow! 
DWIGHT:  A single piece of pepperoni please. 
DWIGHT:  Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that? 
DWIGHT:  Aaagh, aaagh! 
DWIGHT:  Absolutely, I will. 
DWIGHT:  Ah! 
DWIGHT:  Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin? 
DWIGHT:  Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah... 
DWIGHT:  Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality. 
DWIGHT:  Aha! 
DWIGHT:  Ah-choo! 
DWIGHT:  Ahh! 
DWIGHT:  Ahh! I can't- 
DWIGHT:  Ahh. Aaaah. 
DWIGHT:  Ahhh!  
DWIGHT:  Ahhhh! Whoo hoo! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Sales rules! 
DWIGHT:  All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me. 
DWIGHT:  All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping? 
DWIGHT:  Allow me. You're going to love this.  Ugh should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work. 
DWIGHT:  Am I the 107th caller? 
DWIGHT:  And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. "Harry?" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing. 
DWIGHT:  And he is on TV now! 
DWIGHT:  And Jim! 
DWIGHT:  And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun. 
DWIGHT:  And that needs to be straight as an arrow. 
DWIGHT:  And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World. 
DWIGHT:  Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract. 
DWIGHT:  Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm.  PAM! 
DWIGHT:  Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well? 
DWIGHT:  Argh! Ahh!! 
DWIGHT:  Argh... gah! 
DWIGHT:  Assistant Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT:  Assistant Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT:  Assistant Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT:  Atherozar! 
DWIGHT:  Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of-- 
DWIGHT:  Bare my child. 
DWIGHT:  Best Dundies ever. 
DWIGHT:  blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle... 
DWIGHT:  Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day.  how long we have been striving for greatness?  Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle . A never-ending fight. I say to you  and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight! 
DWIGHT:  Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds.  89... 88... 
DWIGHT:  Boom! 
DWIGHT:  Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss! 
DWIGHT:  Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol! 
DWIGHT:  Breathe. Work your core. Come on. 
DWIGHT:  Bring it in! 
DWIGHT:  But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark s getting out of my car. He s a good boy, does whatever I say. Suit Store 
DWIGHT:  But what if i'm hungry? 
DWIGHT:  Carol had a mustache? 
DWIGHT:  Child's play. Give me something hard to sell. 
DWIGHT:  Clean sack. 
DWIGHT:  Come in. 
DWIGHT:  Come in. Did you have another nightmare? 
DWIGHT:  Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba! 
DWIGHT:  Come on, hurry up you guys! 
DWIGHT:  Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh? 
DWIGHT:  Coolio. 
DWIGHT:  Could you please sign my expense report? 
DWIGHT:  Crap.  Come here you. 
DWIGHT:  Crentist. 
DWIGHT:  Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number? 
DWIGHT:  Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it s an idea. But what does it mean? 
DWIGHT:  Dad? 
DWIGHT:  Dammit. 
DWIGHT:  D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear. 
DWIGHT:  Do you have powers? 
DWIGHT:  Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick? 
DWIGHT:  Does he own a gun? Show her. 
DWIGHT:  Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing. 
DWIGHT:  Don't fire me. Please. 
DWIGHT:  Don't let-shh! 
DWIGHT:  Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work... 
DWIGHT:  Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work. M 
DWIGHT:  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold.  Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein! 
DWIGHT:  Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute. 
DWIGHT:  Dwight & 
DWIGHT:  Dwight Schrute is manager!  
DWIGHT:  Dwight Schrute. 
DWIGHT:  Dwight Schrute.  Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town? 
DWIGHT:  Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up. 
DWIGHT:  Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you.  Jordan, gather my things from my desk.  
DWIGHT:  Erin, did we win? 
DWIGHT:  Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing. 
DWIGHT:  Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now! 
DWIGHT:  Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they? 
DWIGHT:  Excuse me. Tall Girl 
DWIGHT:  Extreme! Parkour! 
DWIGHT:  Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five... 
DWIGHT:  For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. 
DWIGHT:  Gaaaaa.... 
DWIGHT:  Gah-ah-hah-ha! 
DWIGHT:  General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection. 
DWIGHT:  Get in the back. 
DWIGHT:  Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar. 
DWIGHT:  Get out! I m a dad! 
DWIGHT:  Get out. 
DWIGHT:  Gimme that. 
DWIGHT:  Gimme the leads. Where are my leads? 
DWIGHT:  Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of... 
DWIGHT:  GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB! 
DWIGHT:  Good morning. 
DWIGHT:  Good. 
DWIGHT:  Good. Excellent. Thank you. Female 
DWIGHT:  Got cat turd collector written all over him. Suit Store

DWIGHT:  Great. 
DWIGHT:  Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange! 
DWIGHT:  Gy-na  said that? 
DWIGHT:  Ha ha ha... the old bullpen. 
DWIGHT:  Haahh!!  
DWIGHT:  Happy Valentine's Day.  It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes!  Ahh! 
DWIGHT:  Haulin' cube! 
DWIGHT:  Have a seat. Allow me. 
DWIGHT:  Have you been introduced to Kevin? 
DWIGHT:  He forgot to mention the herpes. 
DWIGHT:  He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well. 
DWIGHT:  He needs me. Seat saved infinity.  
DWIGHT:  Hello little pill. What do you do? 
DWIGHT:  Hello, am I the 107th caller?  Hello, Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller?  Hell , Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller?  I'm totally gonna win us that box set. 
DWIGHT:  Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years.  What is this? Oh, god.  Henry. 
DWIGHT:  Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Mr. 
DWIGHT:  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now. 
DWIGHT:  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute.  Hello? 
DWIGHT:  Help! Help! 
DWIGHT:  Here we go. Just the two of us  
DWIGHT:  Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a... 
DWIGHT:  Hey kids, was that fun? 
DWIGHT:  Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate. 
DWIGHT:  Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay. 
DWIGHT:  Hey, Halpert, what s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you re stealing Darryl too. When will it end? 
DWIGHT:  Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist? 
DWIGHT:  Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys.  Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim. 
DWIGHT:  Hey, what's up, kid? 
DWIGHT:  Hey, who's dirt box is this? 
DWIGHT:  Hey. 
DWIGHT:  Hey-O! 
DWIGHT:  Hi stranger. 
DWIGHT:  Higher than numbers go.  The ceiling above accounting! 
DWIGHT:  His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman. 
DWIGHT:  Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on!  Que? QUE? Mexican 
DWIGHT:  Hold it! 
DWIGHT:  Holly, you approved this? 
DWIGHT:  How are the marks? 
DWIGHT:  How did you all find each other? Tall Girl 
DWIGHT:  How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you! 
DWIGHT:  How's the family? 
DWIGHT:  Huh, huh, huh!  
DWIGHT:  I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong,  but they're no match for a grown Schrute man.    Let's see what she gets.   Aah! 
DWIGHT:  I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own. 
DWIGHT:  I can't help but think that something we did made this possible. 
DWIGHT:  I can't talk here. It's too sensitive. 
DWIGHT:  I could beat that on a skateboard. 
DWIGHT:  I d love to invest. 
DWIGHT:  I don t know. I just don t know. 
DWIGHT:  I found it! 
DWIGHT:  I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby. 
DWIGHT:  I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over. 
DWIGHT:  I have a complaint about Jim. 
DWIGHT:  I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS! 
DWIGHT:  I have yet another sales order for you to sign. 
DWIGHT:  I hope you ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it s time for another episode of  Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire . 
DWIGHT:  I judge you impish! 
DWIGHT:  I kneel before you. 
DWIGHT:  I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it.  But your face does look like the guy from Operation. Todd 
DWIGHT:  I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets... 
DWIGHT:  I mean truly repulsive acts. 
DWIGHT:  I need you. 
DWIGHT:  I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me? 
DWIGHT:  I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide. 
DWIGHT:  I told you. Todd 
DWIGHT:  I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone.  
DWIGHT:  I want an interview. 
DWIGHT:  I want to put the top down. 
DWIGHT:  I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked.  Totally got the best of that interchange. 
DWIGHT:  I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager! 
DWIGHT:  I work with that guy. 
DWIGHT:  I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo. 
DWIGHT:  I, uh... 
DWIGHT:  I'd like to lodge a complaint. 
DWIGHT:  If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds! 
DWIGHT:  I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year! 
DWIGHT:  I'll give you five bucks for it. 
DWIGHT:  I'll take the wizard! 
DWIGHT:  I'm going... to the dentist. 
DWIGHT:  I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok! 
DWIGHT:  I'm not seeing anything under "confirmation." 
DWIGHT:  I'm on it.  
DWIGHT:  I'm sorry. 
DWIGHT:  Impish!  
DWIGHT:  Insert it in my mouth. 
DWIGHT:  Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on. 
DWIGHT:  Is she hot? Text back, "Kind of." Ben 
DWIGHT:  Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio? 
DWIGHT:  It barely even feels like a prank anymore. 
DWIGHT:  It may have been the costliest decision I ve ever made. 
DWIGHT:  It slipped. 
DWIGHT:  It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart! 
DWIGHT:  It's empty! 
DWIGHT:  It's hot in here. 
DWIGHT:  It's still stinky. 
DWIGHT:  It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things are getting really bad down here. 
DWIGHT:  Jackie Chan!  
DWIGHT:  Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  False. I do not miss him. 
DWIGHT:  Jim, come on. 
DWIGHT:  Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. 
DWIGHT:  Jim, no. No. No! No! 
DWIGHT:  Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration. 
DWIGHT:  Jo, may I speak to you for a second? 
DWIGHT:  Jo, please... I will - 
DWIGHT:  Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire! 
DWIGHT:  Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera!  
DWIGHT:  Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it. 
DWIGHT:  K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail. 
DWIGHT:  Kelly. Kev-  Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to?  In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby. 
DWIGHT:  Kids, don t try planking. It s dangerous.   Specially with me around. 
DWIGHT:  Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed... 
DWIGHT:  Let me give you a hand. 
DWIGHT:  Let s take him  
DWIGHT:  Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar! 
DWIGHT:  Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard!  What the? Damn it temp! 
DWIGHT:  Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those. 
DWIGHT:  Man, how long have we been sitting here? 
DWIGHT:  Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast. 
DWIGHT:  Maybe we should take a little break. 
DWIGHT:  Michael can come home with me. 
DWIGHT:  Michael hit a deer? 
DWIGHT:  Michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof! 
DWIGHT:  Michael! 
DWIGHT:  Michael, what's wrong?! 
DWIGHT:  Michael. 
DWIGHT:  Michael? 
DWIGHT:  Michael? Michael?  Michael?  His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports.  Who's this? Jan? 
DWIGHT:  Mm, less than three. 
DWIGHT:  Mm. 
DWIGHT:  Mmm... hello tiny one. 
DWIGHT:  Mmmmm... 
DWIGHT:  Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy? 
DWIGHT:  Mose! 
DWIGHT:  Move! 
DWIGHT:  Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink. 
DWIGHT:  My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating... 
DWIGHT:  Nazi was a fascist movement... 
DWIGHT:  Near near near near near! 
DWIGHT:  Nice catch. 
DWIGHT:  Nice. 
DWIGHT:  No earbuds!  
DWIGHT:  No thank you. 
DWIGHT:  No you didn't. 
DWIGHT:  No! 
DWIGHT:  No! 
DWIGHT:  No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do. 
DWIGHT:  No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously? 
DWIGHT:  No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them.  
DWIGHT:  No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence. 
DWIGHT:  No. 
DWIGHT:  Now then, we were saying. When my workers-gather- 
DWIGHT:  Now. 
DWIGHT:  Oh D. 
DWIGHT:  Oh God, here. 
DWIGHT:  Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No! 
DWIGHT:  Oh God. 
DWIGHT:  Oh god. 
DWIGHT:  Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you. 
DWIGHT:  Oh my God! 
DWIGHT:  Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful.  Four!  Oh yeah! 
DWIGHT:  Oh no. Fabulous. 
DWIGHT:  Oh yes! Yeah! 
DWIGHT:  Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God.  
DWIGHT:  Oh! You re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh?  
DWIGHT:  Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix- 
DWIGHT:  Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee!  Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah! 
DWIGHT:  Oh, god. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, look at that. Yeah, he s free anytime. Not a problem. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha! 
DWIGHT:  Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, the wires need insulation.  It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, there's one mistake. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, yeah. 
DWIGHT:  Oh. 
DWIGHT:  Oh. Come to reason with me? 
DWIGHT:  Oh. Oh. Oh.  One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops.  You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse? 
DWIGHT:  Oh... 
DWIGHT:  Ohh... Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I! 
DWIGHT:  OK, how is my voice now? 
DWIGHT:  OK, let s look at some ties. 
DWIGHT:  OK, we'll be skins! 
DWIGHT:  Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael. 
DWIGHT:  Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill. Gym 
DWIGHT:  Okay, let me finish this thought. 
DWIGHT:  Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops! 
DWIGHT:  Okay, that's weird. Just hitting "door closed." What? 
DWIGHT:  Okay, we re good. We re good. Let s go. Push! 
DWIGHT:  Okay, you're done. Old 
DWIGHT:  Once again, it's show time. Robert 
DWIGHT:  One... 
DWIGHT:  Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff? 
DWIGHT:  Ooh. 
DWIGHT:  Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready. 
DWIGHT:  Orientation is over. 
DWIGHT:  Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow. 
DWIGHT:  Oww! 
DWIGHT:  Pam. 
DWIGHT:  Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area. 
DWIGHT:  People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom.  Okay, what is it, what can't I guess? 
DWIGHT:  People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck. 
DWIGHT:  People! 
DWIGHT:  Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you.  Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up. 
DWIGHT:  Phyllis? 
DWIGHT:  Please take note of the new color-coding system. 
DWIGHT:  Please? Please? 
DWIGHT:  Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night. 
DWIGHT:  Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done.  Gabriel, I apologize. 
DWIGHT:  Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen. 
DWIGHT:  Pull over! 
DWIGHT:  pum pum pum pum pum pum pum 
DWIGHT:  Really Jim? Really? Very funny. 
DWIGHT:  Really? 
DWIGHT:  Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots. 
DWIGHT:  Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics? 
DWIGHT:  Right? Come on! 
DWIGHT:  Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun! 
DWIGHT:  Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it! Robert 
DWIGHT:  Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo!  
DWIGHT:  Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA! 
DWIGHT:  Rrahh!  
DWIGHT:  Rrrah! 
DWIGHT:  Same thing. 
DWIGHT:  Seagull.  
DWIGHT:  Sedes introiti.  Seat of entrance. 
DWIGHT:  Sensei, hello it's Sempai... 
DWIGHT:  Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment. 
DWIGHT:  Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum  I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum  
DWIGHT:  She's right Pam. 
DWIGHT:  Shh! 
DWIGHT:  Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash!  
DWIGHT:  Showtime. 
DWIGHT:  Shrute! Shrute! 
DWIGHT:  Shut up, woman! 
DWIGHT:  Sign this. 
DWIGHT:  Silence. Todd 
DWIGHT:  So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest penis I have ever seen." And I said, "I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." Well, hello Danny! 
DWIGHT:  So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk. 
DWIGHT:  So long, Stanley! 
DWIGHT:  So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis...  
DWIGHT:  So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement. 
DWIGHT:  Somebody's found the hog maw. 
DWIGHT:  Sorry, go ahead. 
DWIGHT:  Stand back! 
DWIGHT:  Start the party. 
DWIGHT:  Stop it, get out! That's my spool. 
DWIGHT:  Stop moving! 
DWIGHT:  Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs. 
DWIGHT:  Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring? 
DWIGHT:  Take a seat down there. Second from the end. 
DWIGHT:  Take that, Saddam! 
DWIGHT:  Take this pen and stab me with it. 
DWIGHT:  Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you so much. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you so much.  
DWIGHT:  Thank you, Esther. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you, Michael. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you, Michael. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you, so much. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you. Aunt 
DWIGHT:  That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed. 
DWIGHT:  That s not true. Just give me another chance. 
DWIGHT:  That was an intelligent comment. 
DWIGHT:  That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864.  The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off! 
DWIGHT:  That you look like the world's tallest hobbit.  
DWIGHT:  That's Batman. 
DWIGHT:  That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning!  Hah! 
DWIGHT:  That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. 
DWIGHT:  That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson. 
DWIGHT:  That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead. 
DWIGHT:  That's two things. 
DWIGHT:  That's what I'm saying! No of course not! 
DWIGHT:  The boss isn't funny. 
DWIGHT:  The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre   to the power of two. 
DWIGHT:  The Nard Dog... what was that all about? 
DWIGHT:  There are over four hundred of these!  
DWIGHT:  There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert. 
DWIGHT:  There he is. That s Lloyd. 
DWIGHT:  There's no fires within eight miles of here. 
DWIGHT:  They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats. 
DWIGHT:  Thirty nine... sixty. 
DWIGHT:  This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most. 
DWIGHT:  This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites. 
DWIGHT:  This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don t lie. I can tell if you re lying. David 
DWIGHT:  This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me. 
DWIGHT:  This is it. Any questions? 
DWIGHT:  This is Kevin Malone, is David there? 
DWIGHT:  This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style. 
DWIGHT:  This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace. 
DWIGHT:  This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything. 
DWIGHT:  This is what we know. 
DWIGHT:  This is your job, Halpert. 
DWIGHT:  This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute! 
DWIGHT:  This place has gone to hell. 
DWIGHT:  Time! No, you failed. 
DWIGHT:  Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring. 
DWIGHT:  Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me. 
DWIGHT:  Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit.... 
DWIGHT:  Ugh! Ow. 
DWIGHT:  Uh oh...  
DWIGHT:  Uh! 
DWIGHT:  Uh, ugh, ohhhh... 
DWIGHT:  Uh... 
DWIGHT:  Uhh, aah! 
DWIGHT:  Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up.  Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation. 
DWIGHT:  Unh! Scratch. 
DWIGHT:  Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun. 
DWIGHT:  Utica! Utica! 
DWIGHT:  Utica! Utica! Utica! Michael and 
DWIGHT:  WAH! GAH!  
DWIGHT:  Wait a minute, you guys? You heard? 
DWIGHT:  Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange.  Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump. 
DWIGHT:  Wait, why are you limping? 
DWIGHT:  Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22  If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180! 
DWIGHT:  We are climbing some stairs. 
DWIGHT:  We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol. 
DWIGHT:  We don t get along. 
DWIGHT:  We need a winch and a hoist. 
DWIGHT:  We'll bill you. 
DWIGHT:  Well fought. I accept the outcome. 
DWIGHT:  Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved. 
DWIGHT:  Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side. 
DWIGHT:  Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da!  
DWIGHT:  Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you. 
DWIGHT:  Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten. 
DWIGHT:  Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they re not even good. Really, they re bad. Like you and your son. 
DWIGHT:  Well, what can you do? Life. 
DWIGHT:  Wha-?  Damn it, Jim! 
DWIGHT:  What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh? 
DWIGHT:  What are you doing here? 
DWIGHT:  What are you guys talking about? 
DWIGHT:  What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning? 
DWIGHT:  What do you think? 
DWIGHT:  What is going on? 
DWIGHT:  What is going on? What is going on? 
DWIGHT:  What is that?! What are you supposed to be? 
DWIGHT:  What the?  "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone." Destroy phone?  
DWIGHT:  What was that for? 
DWIGHT:  What? 
DWIGHT:  What're you talking about? 
DWIGHT:  What's going on? 
DWIGHT:  What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband.  
DWIGHT:  Where's the bug? 
DWIGHT:  who is it? 
DWIGHT:  Whoa hey, why not? 
DWIGHT:  Whoo! 
DWIGHT:  Whoo! 
DWIGHT:  Who's ready to work? 
DWIGHT:  Why did you pick this place?  
DWIGHT:  Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo. 
DWIGHT:  Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past. 
DWIGHT:  With sex! 
DWIGHT:  Woo hoo! 
DWIGHT:  Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this. 
DWIGHT:  Write legibly people. 
DWIGHT:  Yeah right.  
DWIGHT:  Yeah! 
DWIGHT:  Yeah!  In your face! 
DWIGHT:  Yeah! Gainer! Woohoo! 
DWIGHT:  Yeah! Ok! Beat that!  Whoo! Ok. 
DWIGHT:  Yeah. 
DWIGHT:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah. 
DWIGHT:  Yeah. Yes! 
DWIGHT:  Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo!  Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est--  I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation. 
DWIGHT:  Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good.  Ohh...  Oh, what a day. What a day. 
DWIGHT:  Yes! 
DWIGHT:  Yes! 
DWIGHT:  Yes! Thank you! 
DWIGHT:  Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on.  What kind of poison did you use? 
DWIGHT:  Yes, I have an office.  Bigger than his. 
DWIGHT:  Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake. 
DWIGHT:  Yes. 
DWIGHT:  Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk? Female 
DWIGHT:  Yes. What are my expectations for the group? 
DWIGHT:  You are giving me this raise! I deserve this raise!  Yes!  Yes! Yes! Hiya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah! Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome! 
DWIGHT:  You can't be serious. Are you serious? 
DWIGHT:  You have everything? 
DWIGHT:  You kidding? I was born ready.  
DWIGHT:  You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over. 
DWIGHT:  You look good in this. 
DWIGHT:  You need my pitchfork? 
DWIGHT:  You okay? 
DWIGHT:  You okay? 
DWIGHT:  You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh? 
DWIGHT:  You said you weren t going to look back. 
DWIGHT:  You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills? 
DWIGHT:  You should get one of these. 
DWIGHT:  You should learn from him, right? 
DWIGHT:  You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples.  
DWIGHT:  You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression. 
DWIGHT:  Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night. 
DWIGHT:  You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say "Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is." I can't wait. 
DWIGHT:  You're an idiot. 
DWIGHT:  You're gonna blow it. 
DWIGHT:  You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening. 
DWIGHT:  You're the idiot! 
DWIGHT:  You're welcome!  
DWIGHT:  You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave...  
DWIGHT: "A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane. Titanic. 
DWIGHT: "-But we'll be together then-" 
DWIGHT: "But we'll get together then, we're gonna have a good time-" 
DWIGHT: "-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then." 
DWIGHT: "Don't be an idiot." Changed my life. 
DWIGHT: "Don't sleep with your boss"? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan? 
DWIGHT: "I don't know when-" 
DWIGHT: "I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit." 
DWIGHT: "Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?" 
DWIGHT: "Interviewer has suspect motives." 
DWIGHT: "Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth." Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need. 
DWIGHT: "Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process." 
DWIGHT: "Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV." 
DWIGHT: "The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it." 
DWIGHT: "We?" 
DWIGHT: "When you coming home Dad? 
DWIGHT: "Which is you" is not a sentence. 
DWIGHT: "You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name." You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it. 
DWIGHT: $100 a day, plus expenses. 
DWIGHT: $200. 
DWIGHT: $30,000? There's gotta be another way. 
DWIGHT: (Bleep) 
DWIGHT: (smirking) Exactly. 
DWIGHT: (takes out bag) 40. Always. 
DWIGHT: . Get out of my way. 
DWIGHT: .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so.  
DWIGHT: ... ... You're welcome. 
DWIGHT: ... is there any news on the leads? 
DWIGHT: ... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially. 
DWIGHT: ....back orders and you never called them. 
DWIGHT: ...and I am very proud of being a narc. 
DWIGHT: ...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door? 
DWIGHT: ...and then we compare notes. 
DWIGHT: ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have... 
DWIGHT: ...before noon... 
DWIGHT: ...for people's behavior. 
DWIGHT: ...from the 1930's... 
DWIGHT: ...hollowed out, 
DWIGHT: ...I would fire Anthony Gardner... 
DWIGHT: ...I'll consider it. 
DWIGHT: ...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason. 
DWIGHT: ...is really tight. 
DWIGHT: ...never been lower! 
DWIGHT: ...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think. 
DWIGHT: ...noted. 
DWIGHT: ...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms. 
DWIGHT: ...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%. 
DWIGHT: ...Oh my God. Animal stool.  
DWIGHT: ...ok.  
DWIGHT: ...Okay. 
DWIGHT: ...so good. 
DWIGHT: ...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine. 
DWIGHT: ...the fact... 
DWIGHT: ...their own children. 
DWIGHT: ...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads. 
DWIGHT: ...to consolidate power. 
DWIGHT: ...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know. 
DWIGHT: ...with you.  
DWIGHT: ...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison. David 
DWIGHT: ..where it was and it needs, it needs a... 
DWIGHT: 25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it! 
DWIGHT: 300 and one penny. 
DWIGHT: 350 and one penny. 
DWIGHT: 400 and one penny. 
DWIGHT: 500 and one penny. 
DWIGHT: 700 and one penny. 
DWIGHT: A bat! Impressive... 
DWIGHT: A bazooka. You remembered. 
DWIGHT: A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat! 
DWIGHT: A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay. 
DWIGHT: A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose. 
DWIGHT: A few of the ground rules? 
DWIGHT: A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged. Mr. 
DWIGHT: A hero kills people, people that wish him harm. Mr. 
DWIGHT: A hunter. 
DWIGHT: A knife. 
DWIGHT: A lightbulb. Okay. Okay.  Invisible ink. 
DWIGHT: A little eye for an eye action. 
DWIGHT: A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship. 
DWIGHT: A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time. 
DWIGHT: A loyal, but bungling apostle. 
DWIGHT: A man is found hanging from the ceiling... 
DWIGHT: A net? a giant net? 
DWIGHT: A quilt. Depression quilt? 
DWIGHT: A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people. 
DWIGHT: A thousand times more. 
DWIGHT: A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people. 
DWIGHT: A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute. 
DWIGHT: Aaaaaaaa! 
DWIGHT: Aaaaaaaa! 
DWIGHT: Aaaaaaaa! 
DWIGHT: Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do? 
DWIGHT: Aaaaah! 
DWIGHT: Aaaarrhh!  
DWIGHT: Aaah! 
DWIGHT: Aah! 
DWIGHT: Aah! 
DWIGHT: Aah! 
DWIGHT: Aah! Actually, he s right in front of us. 
DWIGHT: Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it s your call. 
DWIGHT: About two more minutes . 
DWIGHT: About what? 
DWIGHT: Absolutely I would not. 
DWIGHT: Absolutely not. 
DWIGHT: Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch-- 
DWIGHT: Absolutely, I do.  
DWIGHT: Accept it, why would he come back? 
DWIGHT: Acceptable names include and are limited 
DWIGHT: Accepted. 
DWIGHT: Accountability booster. 
DWIGHT: Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin.  
DWIGHT: Action. 
DWIGHT: Actually  You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I ll take one too. 
DWIGHT: Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw. 
DWIGHT: Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor. 
DWIGHT: Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex. 
DWIGHT: Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention.   Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching. 
DWIGHT: Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease. 
DWIGHT: Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood. 
DWIGHT: Admit it. Admit it. 
DWIGHT: Admit that there is a chance. 
DWIGHT: After you. 
DWIGHT: Aggggh, that stings! 
DWIGHT: Agreed.  
DWIGHT: Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on. 
DWIGHT: Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest. 
DWIGHT: Ah damn pop-ups. 
DWIGHT: Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha! 
DWIGHT: Ah! 
DWIGHT: Ah!  That s how it s done. 
DWIGHT: Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer! 
DWIGHT: Ah! Mr. Bart! Ugh!   There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one. 
DWIGHT: Ah! Not so fast. 
DWIGHT: Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat. 
DWIGHT: Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested? 
DWIGHT: Ah, I'm not interested. 
DWIGHT: Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue. 
DWIGHT: Ah, much, ok. 
DWIGHT: Ah, no.  You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth. 
DWIGHT: Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now. 
DWIGHT: Ah, that's a pain in the ass. 
DWIGHT: Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome. Mr. 
DWIGHT: Ah. 
DWIGHT: Ah.  Here, replinish your fluids. 
DWIGHT: Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence.  No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.  
DWIGHT: Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone. 
DWIGHT: Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand. 
DWIGHT: Aha! A lightbulb. 
DWIGHT: Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... . 
DWIGHT: Ahh! 
DWIGHT: Ahh! 
DWIGHT: Ahh! OK! 
DWIGHT: Ahh-chaa! 
DWIGHT: Ahhh. Mweehaa 
DWIGHT: Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! 
DWIGHT: AHHHHHHHHHHHH! 
DWIGHT: Ah-luh-luh, a little comment. Muh. 
DWIGHT: AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest. 
DWIGHT: Alien. Blagh! 
DWIGHT: All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news. 
DWIGHT: All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks! 
DWIGHT: All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J�rg Ro�kopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba. 
DWIGHT: All Right 
DWIGHT: All right then. Someone propose a plan. 
DWIGHT: All Right! 
DWIGHT: All right! What is going on here? 
DWIGHT: All right, fine.   Brrring. 
DWIGHT: All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want? 
DWIGHT: All right, I'll take them. 
DWIGHT: All right, let's do this. 
DWIGHT: All right, next. Ryan.  
DWIGHT: All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand.  Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself.  
DWIGHT: All right, we're set. 
DWIGHT: All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them. 
DWIGHT: All right, who's ready for the next presentation? 
DWIGHT: All right. 
DWIGHT: All right. 
DWIGHT: All right. 
DWIGHT: All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill. 
DWIGHT: All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter? 
DWIGHT: All right. Sounds good. 
DWIGHT: All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area.  
DWIGHT: All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders. 
DWIGHT: All their top clients I can't believe it. 
DWIGHT: All we can do is sit and wait. 
DWIGHT: All you have to do it say it. 
DWIGHT: Alleged contract. 
DWIGHT: Almost there. Almost there.  Okay. We re running late. Let s get him inside. 
DWIGHT: Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday? Fake 
DWIGHT: Alright! Uh!  
DWIGHT: Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape. 
DWIGHT: Alright, move it. 
DWIGHT: Alright. 
DWIGHT: Alright. 
DWIGHT: Alright.  
DWIGHT: Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  Let's ride. 
DWIGHT: Alright. First thing in the morning then. 
DWIGHT: Alright. I'll call you, kid. 
DWIGHT: Alright. Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas. 
DWIGHT: Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after. 
DWIGHT: Also, he slept with Pam. 
DWIGHT: Also, it's icky back there. 
DWIGHT: Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad...   And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, "I do."   And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply... 
DWIGHT: Always the padawan, never the Jedi. 
DWIGHT: Always.  
DWIGHT: Amazing. 
DWIGHT: Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle. 
DWIGHT: Amazons. 
DWIGHT: American Idol? What? No. 
DWIGHT: American, Irrigation, and Night-Time. 
DWIGHT: An  X.  
DWIGHT: And "Breaking Corporate News." Chad 
DWIGHT: And anoth  
DWIGHT: And circle gets the square. 
DWIGHT: And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up. 
DWIGHT: And Dwight. 
DWIGHT: And flexible. 
DWIGHT: And for oh, whoopsie daisy.  Mrs. 
DWIGHT: And he made us all look like chumps! 
DWIGHT: And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage.  Don't you Garbage?  
DWIGHT: And how big do you want this robot? 
DWIGHT: And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes? Front Desk 
DWIGHT: And I have to say your leadership... 
DWIGHT: And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich! 
DWIGHT: -and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "I'd like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls. 
DWIGHT: And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper. 
DWIGHT: And I turned it down. 
DWIGHT: And I ve never seen you go to work, ever. 
DWIGHT: And I was thinking it s only fair that you help make this decision since they ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife. 
DWIGHT: And I, yours. So I will cede her to you. 
DWIGHT: And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk. 
DWIGHT: And I'm going to find that person and punish them. 
DWIGHT: And I'm telling you that I will never back down. 
DWIGHT: And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said "Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of". 
DWIGHT: And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers. 
DWIGHT: And it's- 
DWIGHT: And it's clear we're not going to carry them.  
DWIGHT: And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you. 
DWIGHT: And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us. 
DWIGHT: And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'. 
DWIGHT: And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia! 
DWIGHT: And no, I cannot lower my current prices.   Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown. 
DWIGHT: And not come through for you? 
DWIGHT: And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred.  Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread.  And let's hear it for... Purebred.  Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick...  Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King!  
DWIGHT: And one girl push-up. 
DWIGHT: And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife.   I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here. 
DWIGHT: And she called it nuts? 
DWIGHT: And she is your boss. 
DWIGHT: And that's why you have an assistant regional manager. 
DWIGHT: And the Jennifer Weiner collection. 
DWIGHT: And the rest was just stuff. 
DWIGHT: And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane? 
DWIGHT: And then I inserted my penis- 
DWIGHT: And then if I want... 
DWIGHT: And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife. 
DWIGHT: And there's parts of her I don't even recognize. 
DWIGHT: And they do, your parents, love you very much. 
DWIGHT: And they said it couldn t be done. Boom! 
DWIGHT: And they would call me the Overkill Killer. 
DWIGHT: And this chair s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha! 
DWIGHT: And wake up in the future. 
DWIGHT: And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us. 
DWIGHT: And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice?  Fire Andy. Fire. Andy. 
DWIGHT: And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation? 
DWIGHT: And who had your office? 
DWIGHT: And who is this "the" Steve Nash? 
DWIGHT: And you are  
DWIGHT: And you burned over a thousand calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen!   
DWIGHT: And you closed it. The boys are back in town.  High fives! Ha ha! 
DWIGHT: And you didn t call Jim - that seems significant. 
DWIGHT: And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations!   
DWIGHT: And you look like one too. Thank you Angela. 
DWIGHT: And you might not like how I find it.  
DWIGHT: And you must be uh, from the Washington Post. Chad 
DWIGHT: And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes. 
DWIGHT: And you want me to come with you. 
DWIGHT: And you will be hearing from the - 
DWIGHT: And you will not be pleased with the result.   
DWIGHT: And you'll compare the times? 
DWIGHT: And your affiliation with Cornell - 
DWIGHT: And your veil. 
DWIGHT: And, well, I don't see my co-workers-- 
DWIGHT: And... go.  Force it in as deep as you can. 
DWIGHT: Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions? 
DWIGHT: Andy  I need to talk to you. 
DWIGHT: Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them. 
DWIGHT: Andy I m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences. 
DWIGHT: Andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game. 
DWIGHT: Andy!  
DWIGHT: Andy! Leapfrog!  
DWIGHT: Andy, I can't hear this right now. 
DWIGHT: Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don t quit your day job. 
DWIGHT: Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's? 
DWIGHT: Andy, Jim is just too...essen-... 
DWIGHT: Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work. 
DWIGHT: Andy. 
DWIGHT: Andy. 
DWIGHT: Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya. 
DWIGHT: Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready. 
DWIGHT: Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela. 
DWIGHT: Angela, not here! 
DWIGHT: Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me. 
DWIGHT: Angela, what about you? 
DWIGHT: Angela, would you like some of my beet salad? 
DWIGHT: Angela, you're up. 
DWIGHT: Angela.  
DWIGHT: Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out- 
DWIGHT: Angela... 
DWIGHT: Angela?  Angela!  
DWIGHT: Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her. 
DWIGHT: Angry. 
DWIGHT: Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six. 
DWIGHT: Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine. 
DWIGHT: Answer me this, though. 
DWIGHT: Answer me. 
DWIGHT: Any brothers or sisters? 
DWIGHT: Any kind of meat that you can possibly name! 
DWIGHT: Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife, 
DWIGHT: Any specific animal? 
DWIGHT: Anyone else? 
DWIGHT: Anything else would be inconsistent. 
DWIGHT: Anything else you need to talk about? 
DWIGHT: Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer? 
DWIGHT: Apology rejected. 
DWIGHT: Appalling.  Eye sore.  Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds! 
DWIGHT: Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl... 
DWIGHT: Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...? 
DWIGHT: Apparently. 
DWIGHT: Are there any bloggers around? 
DWIGHT: Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha. 
DWIGHT: Are those real pearls? 
DWIGHT: Are we idiots?  What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?! 
DWIGHT: Are you a doctor, or a male nurse? 
DWIGHT: Are you calling me an idiot? 
DWIGHT: Are you enjoying your mineral water? 
DWIGHT: Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles? 
DWIGHT: Are you going? 
DWIGHT: Are you kidding me? 
DWIGHT: Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation. 
DWIGHT: Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway. 
DWIGHT: Are you near sighted or far sighted? Ben 
DWIGHT: Are you nuts? 
DWIGHT: Are you pretending to be crazy, huh? 
DWIGHT: Are you really not going to punch him? 
DWIGHT: Are you referring to alchemy? 
DWIGHT: Are you saying you invented paper? 
DWIGHT: Are you serious? 
DWIGHT: Are you socialist? 
DWIGHT: Are you sure that's going to work? 
DWIGHT: Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's. 
DWIGHT: Are you trying to sabotage this entire event? 
DWIGHT: Are you warmed up?  
DWIGHT: Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this? 
DWIGHT: Aren't they magnificent? 
DWIGHT: Argggg! 
DWIGHT: Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them. 
DWIGHT: Arrest Jim. He poisoned me. 
DWIGHT: As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical. 
DWIGHT: As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved. 
DWIGHT: As Assistant Regional Manager... 
DWIGHT: As has Angela! 
DWIGHT: As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed.  As has Michael and as has Holly. 
DWIGHT: As if you had a choice.  Duh.  Opportunity of a lifetime.  
DWIGHT: As ranking number three in this office, I am order - 
DWIGHT: Ask him about the party. 
DWIGHT: Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D. 
DWIGHT: Assistant regional manager. 
DWIGHT: Assistant Sensei. 
DWIGHT: Assistant team manager? 
DWIGHT: Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT: Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it. 
DWIGHT: At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right? 
DWIGHT: At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership. 
DWIGHT: At what time? 
DWIGHT: Attention blue collar workers! 
DWIGHT: Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring? 
DWIGHT: Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine. 
DWIGHT: Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left.   And most of you are just as fat as the day we began. 
DWIGHT: Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion. 
DWIGHT: Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan. 
DWIGHT: Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute! 
DWIGHT: Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office.  Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and  
DWIGHT: Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court - 
DWIGHT: Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as... 
DWIGHT: Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen. 
DWIGHT: Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Aw, cramp, I'm just-  
DWIGHT: Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport? 
DWIGHT: Aw, man.  This is not very clever, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Aw, Pam, you're adorable  
DWIGHT: Awesome! 
DWIGHT: Awesome. 
DWIGHT: Aww, Darryl. 
DWIGHT: Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun?  What is that meaningful look? 
DWIGHT: Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it. 
DWIGHT: Awww! 
DWIGHT: Aye aye, Captain. 
DWIGHT: Aye. 
DWIGHT: Ayyyy! 
DWIGHT: Ayyyy! Phone 
DWIGHT: BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes! 
DWIGHT: Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision. 
DWIGHT: Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone. No bunching! 
DWIGHT: Based on his merit. 
DWIGHT: Basement office? You mean like a lair? 
DWIGHT: Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store. 
DWIGHT: Battlestar Galatica. 
DWIGHT: Be prepared to hold folks  From 9 am to... 
DWIGHT: Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?! 
DWIGHT: Because if we don't play, then the other team wins. 
DWIGHT: Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge. 
DWIGHT: Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head. 
DWIGHT: Because we're friends. 
DWIGHT: Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It s like air to you people. Ugh, God.  
DWIGHT: Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best. 
DWIGHT: Because you're engaged to Andy. 
DWIGHT: Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you. 
DWIGHT: Been there, done that. 
DWIGHT: Before I go, may I? 
DWIGHT: Before taxes. 
DWIGHT: Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract. 
DWIGHT: Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it.  Devon! 
DWIGHT: Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best. 
DWIGHT: Believe it. 
DWIGHT: Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers. 
DWIGHT: Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam. 
DWIGHT: Big day for you. 
DWIGHT: Big smiles folks! There they are. 
DWIGHT: Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait. 
DWIGHT: Bildenkinder. 
DWIGHT: Birthday hug! 
DWIGHT: Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand?  You're like a giant walking salami! 
DWIGHT: Blah. 
DWIGHT: Blink once if you want me to pull the plug. 
DWIGHT: Blood, urine, or semen. 
DWIGHT: Boo, unimpressed. It s a tightrope for babies. Boo! 
DWIGHT: Bottom line. Do I need to be worried? 
DWIGHT: Bow down before Recyclops. 
DWIGHT: Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall! 
DWIGHT: Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses. 
DWIGHT: Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they? 
DWIGHT: Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have. 
DWIGHT: Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it. Warren 
DWIGHT: Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW! 
DWIGHT: Breathing. Is that you? 
DWIGHT: Brides side or grooms side? Or townie? 
DWIGHT: Bring him the gabba-gool! 
DWIGHT: Bring it on.   
DWIGHT: Bring it. 
DWIGHT: Brought it in here- 
DWIGHT: Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie. 
DWIGHT: Burgers. 
DWIGHT: Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay?  Infuriating, irresponsible ... 
DWIGHT: Busy! 
DWIGHT: But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me. 
DWIGHT: But check that it's covered by your 
DWIGHT: But check that it's covered by your health care provider! 
DWIGHT: But don't forget you owe me $10. 
DWIGHT: But effective, look!  On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas. 
DWIGHT: But I can give you this pitch in one minute- 
DWIGHT: But I don't have any... 
DWIGHT: But I'm right? 
DWIGHT: But not in your bed. It's lumpy. 
DWIGHT: But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa...  
DWIGHT: But that's illegal. 
DWIGHT: But that's my name.  Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch.  Thank you. 
DWIGHT: But the coffee in Peru is far hotter. 
DWIGHT: But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve. 
DWIGHT: But the little cars go in the compact spot Michael and 
DWIGHT: But the little cars go in the compact spot! 
DWIGHT: But then no one can see us. 
DWIGHT: But then you wouldn't have me here. 
DWIGHT: But this isn t interim manager. No. It s Dwight K. Schrute   Manager. David 
DWIGHT: But we were gonna break the pig rib. 
DWIGHT: But when I do, we'll have something to talk about. 
DWIGHT: But you can say that about anything. 
DWIGHT: But you know what, I want to make it up to you. There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job. Interested? 
DWIGHT: But you still work for Wired, right? 
DWIGHT: But you work tomorrow. 
DWIGHT: But you're the one who picked today. 
DWIGHT: But, do not worry. I have his home address right  here. 
DWIGHT: But... hey, Cece's toothbrush. 
DWIGHT: But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here? 
DWIGHT: Butter. Newborns are slippery. 
DWIGHT: By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela? 
DWIGHT: By hand. 
DWIGHT: Bye Michael!   Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Bye Pam. 
DWIGHT: Bye poochie! 
DWIGHT: C mon, c mon. 
DWIGHT: C mon. 
DWIGHT: C mon. 
DWIGHT: Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim? 
DWIGHT: Calm, please 
DWIGHT: Calves. Calves all the way. 
DWIGHT: Can I be team captain? 
DWIGHT: Can I be team manager? 
DWIGHT: Can I be your representative? 
DWIGHT: Can I do some of the talking? 
DWIGHT: Can I drive? 
DWIGHT: Can I have an office? 
DWIGHT: Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back? 
DWIGHT: Can I listen to my music at a low volume? 
DWIGHT: Can I talk to you about something? 
DWIGHT: Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me. 
DWIGHT: Can I use your phone? 
DWIGHT: Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or- 
DWIGHT: Can you breathe? 
DWIGHT: Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna  Oops, sorry! 
DWIGHT: Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms? Park 
DWIGHT: Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it. 
DWIGHT: Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical? 
DWIGHT: Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself. 
DWIGHT: Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system. 
DWIGHT: Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file? 
DWIGHT: Care for a piece of chocolate? Ben 
DWIGHT: Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine. Lady 
DWIGHT: Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.

DWIGHT: 'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife. 
DWIGHT: Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.  
DWIGHT: Cause you re interested in going into sales? 
DWIGHT: Cause you're sweeter than candy. 
DWIGHT: Cell phone? Charger?

You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested." True. "The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly..."   
DWIGHT: Come on, folks! 
DWIGHT: Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass. 
DWIGHT: Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.

DWIGHT: -Cornell Application Department, 
DWIGHT: Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it.   
DWIGHT: Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills. 
DWIGHT: Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room. 
DWIGHT: Could be a bat weevil  Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy? 
DWIGHT: Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that. 
DWIGHT: Could be. 
DWIGHT: Could I have a copy of one of them? 
DWIGHT: Could it be under "affirmation?" Cause you have thousands of those. 
DWIGHT: Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose. 
DWIGHT: Cow, goat or sheep.

DWIGHT: Deceit does not come easy to me. 
DWIGHT: De-fense!   De-fense!  Michael and 
DWIGHT: De-fense! De-fense! Warehouse 
DWIGHT: Define foment. 
DWIGHT: Definitely. 
DWIGHT: Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? 
DWIGHT: Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? 
DWIGHT: Describe it. 
DWIGHT: Desperate times call for desperate measures. 
DWIGHT: Deutsch... let me see here. That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus. 
DWIGHT: Did he threaten you? 
DWIGHT: Did I tell you about her teeth? 
DWIGHT: Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes. 
DWIGHT: Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me. 
DWIGHT: Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not. 
DWIGHT: Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal. 
DWIGHT: Did you do her? 
DWIGHT: Did you do her? 
DWIGHT: Did you enjoy your lunch? 
DWIGHT: Did you even read the memo? 
DWIGHT: Did you get anything good? 
DWIGHT: Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances? 
DWIGHT: Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this. 
DWIGHT: Did you get your tickets? 
DWIGHT: Did you just ask me if this was a cow? 
DWIGHT: Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's "Nobody's perfect." Nice stroke, Pam. 
DWIGHT: Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long? 
DWIGHT: Did you say Karen? 
DWIGHT: Did you see the board? 
DWIGHT: Did you tell Pam about the alliance? 
DWIGHT: Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all. 
DWIGHT: Different guy. 
DWIGHT: Ding dong. 
DWIGHT: Disarm! 
DWIGHT: Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece. 
DWIGHT: Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later. 
DWIGHT: Diversifying. Smart. 
DWIGHT: Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this 
DWIGHT: Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves. 
DWIGHT: Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So  have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So yes. I d say I have gotten along with my subordinates. 
DWIGHT: Do it now. 
DWIGHT: Do it. 
DWIGHT: Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers. 
DWIGHT: Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand. 
DWIGHT: Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled!  
DWIGHT: Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier. 
DWIGHT: Do the monkey face! 
DWIGHT: Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years. 
DWIGHT: Do this. Come on. Ready? 
DWIGHT: Do you accept? 
DWIGHT: Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts. 
DWIGHT: Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica? Dan 
DWIGHT: Do you find Cathy Simms attractive? 
DWIGHT: Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor s had stolen from him? 
DWIGHT: Do you have batteries? 
DWIGHT: Do you have the Sharpie?! 
DWIGHT: Do you have the Sharpie?! 
DWIGHT: Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake? 
DWIGHT: Do you have your card? 
DWIGHT: Do you have your money belt? 
DWIGHT: Do you know how to use it? 
DWIGHT: Do you know what "snap decision" means? 
DWIGHT: Do you know what this is?  
DWIGHT: Do you know where we are, temp? 
DWIGHT: Do you live in a regular sized house? 
DWIGHT: Do you love her? 
DWIGHT: Do you love me or not? 
DWIGHT: Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard. 
DWIGHT: Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works. 
DWIGHT: Do you mind? The men are talking. Suit Store 
DWIGHT: Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we? 
DWIGHT: Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, "this way, this way"? 
DWIGHT: Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole. 
DWIGHT: Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it? 
DWIGHT: Do you think? Or do you know? 
DWIGHT: Do you understand how rare is that in nature? 
DWIGHT: Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk! 
DWIGHT: Do you want the link because then you could forward it around? 
DWIGHT: DO YOU WANT TO DIE? 
DWIGHT: Do you want to die? OUT!! 
DWIGHT: Do you want to do this right or not? 
DWIGHT: Do you want to form, an alliance, with me? 
DWIGHT: Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this. 
DWIGHT: Does he have access to their medical records? 
DWIGHT: Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party?  
DWIGHT: Does that include the garage? 
DWIGHT: Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence. 
DWIGHT: Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name? 
DWIGHT: Doesn't matter. 
DWIGHT: Doesn't matter. I'll escort you! 
DWIGHT: Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery. 
DWIGHT: Don t be an idiot. It s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you ve been here. That s the max. 
DWIGHT: Don t listen to him. 
DWIGHT: Don t move. And disarm now!  
DWIGHT: Don t worry, it s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker. 
DWIGHT: Don t! 
DWIGHT: Done. 
DWIGHT: Done. 
DWIGHT: Done.  I never touch a pregnant woman. 
DWIGHT: Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh!  
DWIGHT: Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm 
DWIGHT: Don't be mad, it is a business trip. 
DWIGHT: Don't break up you guys, you're great together. 
DWIGHT: Don't do anything rash! 
DWIGHT: Don't do it  
DWIGHT: Don't do it! 
DWIGHT: Don't do it, Michael. 
DWIGHT: Don't even care! 
DWIGHT: Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush- 
DWIGHT: Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage? Chad 
DWIGHT: Don't leave us! 
DWIGHT: Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim! 
DWIGHT: Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael! 
DWIGHT: Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is." 
DWIGHT: Don't lose your head. 
DWIGHT: Don't make me do this the hard way. 
DWIGHT: Don't make me fire you. 
DWIGHT: Don't make me pre-fire you. 
DWIGHT: Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system. 
DWIGHT: Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen. 
DWIGHT: Don't say cow- Ugh. 
DWIGHT: Don't set it to yourself! 
DWIGHT: Don't tell Michael... 
DWIGHT: Don't want it. 
DWIGHT: Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens. 
DWIGHT: Don't worry about it. You can just owe me. 
DWIGHT: Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore. 
DWIGHT: Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead. 
DWIGHT: Don't you dare! Andy! 
DWIGHT: Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land.   
DWIGHT: Don't you worry about that. I got it covered. Okay? 
DWIGHT: Don't. 
DWIGHT: Door. Chair. It s about Phillip. 
DWIGHT: Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads. 
DWIGHT: Downsizing? 
DWIGHT: Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on. 
DWIGHT: DRAW SOME BLOOD! 
DWIGHT: Drink it! 
DWIGHT: Dripping on me. 
DWIGHT: Drop this one. Abort. 
DWIGHT: Dry rot? 
DWIGHT: Dry. Delicious. 
DWIGHT: Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force. 
DWIGHT: Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. 
DWIGHT: Dumatril! 
DWIGHT: Dumatril. 
DWIGHT: Dunder-Mifflin. 
DWIGHT: Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk. 
DWIGHT: Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend?   Hi, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute for Robert California! 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin. Jerome 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble.  Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there.  A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute.  
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation 
DWIGHT: D-W-I-G-H-T. 
DWIGHT: Dwight... 
DWIGHT: Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host.  Welcome.  
DWIGHT: Dwike? 
DWIGHT: Each one is very different, like a snowflake. 
DWIGHT: Eager. 
DWIGHT: Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes.  Block. Grasp wrist as such.  
DWIGHT: Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen.  Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going. 
DWIGHT: Eat it! 
DWIGHT: Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it! 
DWIGHT: Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities? 
DWIGHT: Ed was decapitated. 
DWIGHT: Eel fishing. 
DWIGHT: Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah. 
DWIGHT: Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill. 
DWIGHT: Eh, its not that early. 
DWIGHT: Eh, it's not worth it. 
DWIGHT: Eh, I've been sitting all day. 
DWIGHT: Eh. 
DWIGHT: Eiffel Tower. 
DWIGHT: Eight minutes! 
DWIGHT: Eight? 
DWIGHT: Eighty thousand dollars a year. 
DWIGHT: Either he goes, or I go. 
DWIGHT: Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer? 
DWIGHT: Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it. 
DWIGHT: Emergency dentist appointment. 
DWIGHT: Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free. 
DWIGHT: Empty mind. 
DWIGHT: English peoples' main use today is judging American talent.  You're crap. You're wonderful.  They're mean, but they're incisive. 
DWIGHT: Enough of this garbage.  This is Christmas.  Hi-yah!!!!!  Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!! 
DWIGHT: Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over. 
DWIGHT: Enter Sandman, Metallica. 
DWIGHT: Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris. 
DWIGHT: Erin   Erin... 
DWIGHT: Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant. 
DWIGHT: Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment. 
DWIGHT: Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row! 
DWIGHT: Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us. 
DWIGHT: Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never. 
DWIGHT: Erin....the receptionist! 
DWIGHT: Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time. 
DWIGHT: Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs! 
DWIGHT: Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much. 
DWIGHT: Esther Ruger.  
DWIGHT: Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots. 
DWIGHT: Eughh.  
DWIGHT: Euughh  Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present  Hey. 
DWIGHT: Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins. 
DWIGHT: Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing. 
DWIGHT: Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms. 
DWIGHT: Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on. 
DWIGHT: Every day is black tie optional! 
DWIGHT: Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on!  Watch it, watch it. 
DWIGHT: Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you re in a suicide cult. 
DWIGHT: Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season. This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn. 
DWIGHT: Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel. 
DWIGHT: Everybody loves beets. 
DWIGHT: Everybody! 
DWIGHT: Everybody! 
DWIGHT: Everybody! Hang on!  
DWIGHT: Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go! 
DWIGHT: Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?  
DWIGHT: Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly. 
DWIGHT: Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit! 
DWIGHT: Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak. 
DWIGHT: Everyone. 
DWIGHT: Everything is fine. You are in the clear. 
DWIGHT: Everything's a joke. 
DWIGHT: Exactly. 
DWIGHT: Exactly. 
DWIGHT: Exactly. 
DWIGHT: Exactly. 
DWIGHT: Exactly. Thank you, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Exactly. Yes. 
DWIGHT: Excellent idea, Pam. 
DWIGHT: Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent. 
DWIGHT: Excellent question. 
DWIGHT: Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt. 
DWIGHT: Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything. 
DWIGHT: Excellent. 
DWIGHT: Excellent. 
DWIGHT: Excellent. 
DWIGHT: Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it.  Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself. 
DWIGHT: Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the... 
DWIGHT: Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four? 
DWIGHT: Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian... 
DWIGHT: Excuse me sir. 
DWIGHT: Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured. 
DWIGHT: Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items. 
DWIGHT: Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please? 
DWIGHT: Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom. 
DWIGHT: Excuse me, I got a question for you. Park 
DWIGHT: Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero. Mr. 
DWIGHT: Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay?  Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will -  He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences. 
DWIGHT: Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior. 
DWIGHT: Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger. 
DWIGHT: Excuse me? 
DWIGHT: Excuse me? 
DWIGHT: Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger. 
DWIGHT: Extend the fingers more. 
DWIGHT: Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance-- 
DWIGHT: Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool. 
DWIGHT: F. Alright, what's the damage? Delivery 
DWIGHT: Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me. 
DWIGHT: Fail! 
DWIGHT: Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured? 
DWIGHT: Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching. 
DWIGHT: False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me! 
DWIGHT: Family only. 
DWIGHT: Fax this for me. 
DWIGHT: Feast on this, Lewis. 
DWIGHT: Fence with a hole in it.. 
DWIGHT: Fifty L. 
DWIGHT: Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear? 
DWIGHT: Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye. 
DWIGHT: Fine! 
DWIGHT: Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway. 
DWIGHT: Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation. 
DWIGHT: Fine, let s go.  
DWIGHT: Fine. 
DWIGHT: Fine. 
DWIGHT: Fine. 
DWIGHT: Fine.  Hey. Tap away.  
DWIGHT: Fine.  Then I just want to be friends. 
DWIGHT: Fine. Five times.  
DWIGHT: Fine. Get outta here. 
DWIGHT: Fine. Good. 
DWIGHT: Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this. 
DWIGHT: Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Fine. Physician's Desk Reference. 
DWIGHT: Fire hazard. 
DWIGHT: Fire Jim. 
DWIGHT: Fire not real. This was merely a training exercise.   So, what have we learned?   Oh come on. It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack. 
DWIGHT: First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have? 
DWIGHT: First present, Oscar. 
DWIGHT: First rule in road-side beet 
DWIGHT: First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor. 
DWIGHT: First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified. 
DWIGHT: Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac. 
DWIGHT: Five minutes ahead of schedule. Right on schedule. 
DWIGHT: Five minutes exactly. 
DWIGHT: Five percent. No less. 
DWIGHT: Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses. 
DWIGHT: Five, four, three, two... 
DWIGHT: Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW! 
DWIGHT: Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence. 
DWIGHT: Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going  please kitty, may I have some more?  You can t make this stuff up! 
DWIGHT: For five years I ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it s time for me to just let that thought go. It s kind of painful, but it s also freeing in a way. Now it s all about my instincts. 
DWIGHT: For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster. 
DWIGHT: For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office. 
DWIGHT: For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts. 
DWIGHT: For reha- 
DWIGHT: For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail! 
DWIGHT: For what purpose? 
DWIGHT: For your convenience, I've broken it down into three 
DWIGHT: Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live. 
DWIGHT: Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes. 
DWIGHT: Found him! 
DWIGHT: Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns. 
DWIGHT: Freeze, give me the list!   
DWIGHT: Fresh hot ink. 
DWIGHT: From Jim. 
DWIGHT: From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack. 
DWIGHT: From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report. Little 
DWIGHT: From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more. 
DWIGHT: From when he recommended me to replace him. 
DWIGHT: Frosting. 
DWIGHT: Fumble! Yaaah! 
DWIGHT: Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy. 
DWIGHT: Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP. 
DWIGHT: Gabe? You don't know? 
DWIGHT: Gah! 
DWIGHT: GAH!!! 
DWIGHT: Gahh! 
DWIGHT: Gahh, dammit!   Come on! Police Officer 
DWIGHT: Game on! 
DWIGHT: Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons.  Look at him. 
DWIGHT: Garbage magnet.  Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design.  I can't believe this doesn't make you mad! 
DWIGHT: Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting? 
DWIGHT: Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons. 
DWIGHT: Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children   What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder) 
DWIGHT: Gentlemen. 
DWIGHT: Get her! Ruin her!  
DWIGHT: Get in the back. 
DWIGHT: Get in the van. 
DWIGHT: Get in! 
DWIGHT: Get in!   
DWIGHT: Get in. 
DWIGHT: Get in. 
DWIGHT: Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out. 
DWIGHT: Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore. 
DWIGHT: Get lost. 
DWIGHT: Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket.   Here we go. 
DWIGHT: Get out Jim.  Actually, um...  Sir, I'm going to need take this chair. 
DWIGHT: Get out of here moron!  
DWIGHT: Get out of Jim s seat. 
DWIGHT: Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK. Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers? Officer 
DWIGHT: Get out of my way. Huh! 
DWIGHT: Get out! We need to do something. I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage. 
DWIGHT: Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping. Dwight, Erin, Jim & 
DWIGHT: Get up off your desks! 
DWIGHT: Get your clouds right. 
DWIGHT: Get your foot behind the yellow line. 
DWIGHT: Get... 
DWIGHT: Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war? 
DWIGHT: Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War. 
DWIGHT: Gimli. 
DWIGHT: Give it a whirl. 
DWIGHT: Give me it. I am not. 
DWIGHT: Give me that. 
DWIGHT: Give me the dice! 
DWIGHT: Give me the dice. 
DWIGHT: Give me the hose! 
DWIGHT: Give me the phone. 
DWIGHT: Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him. 
DWIGHT: Give me the punch card. 
DWIGHT: Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog! 
DWIGHT: Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers. 
DWIGHT: Go ahead and just read the frosting. 
DWIGHT: Go ahead, you do it. 
DWIGHT: Go ahead.

DWIGHT: Go back to the monkey! 
DWIGHT: Go move some paper! 
DWIGHT: Go on. 
DWIGHT: Go put them all in random order. Female 
DWIGHT: Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood.  That s it? Oh, that s great. That s like a five second delay. 
DWIGHT: Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists. 
DWIGHT: Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me. 
DWIGHT: Go! 
DWIGHT: Go, get up there right now. 
DWIGHT: Go, go! Take the stairs! Now! 
DWIGHT: Go. Get the door. 
DWIGHT: Go. Push! 
DWIGHT: God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months. 
DWIGHT: God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?  
DWIGHT: God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this. 
DWIGHT: God, you're such a spy. 
DWIGHT: God. How do whalers do it? 
DWIGHT: God. Where is Jim? 
DWIGHT: God... Damn it! Why us? 
DWIGHT: Gonna get it? 
DWIGHT: Good a spot as any.  
DWIGHT: Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods! 
DWIGHT: Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office. 
DWIGHT: Good evening. 
DWIGHT: Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative. 
DWIGHT: Good luck to you.  
DWIGHT: Good luck, Michael. 
DWIGHT: Good luck, Michael. 
DWIGHT: Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.

DWIGHT: Good morning Michael. 
DWIGHT: Good morning temp. 
DWIGHT: Good Morning! 
DWIGHT: Good morning, Michael. 
DWIGHT: Good morning, Vietnam!  Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates. 
DWIGHT: Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price. 
DWIGHT: Good night. 
DWIGHT: Good night. 
DWIGHT: Good night. 
DWIGHT: Good old Mose.  
DWIGHT: Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent. 
DWIGHT: Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan. 
DWIGHT: Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow.  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh! 
DWIGHT: Good shocks. 
DWIGHT: Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir! 
DWIGHT: Good! Okay. Flirt away. 
DWIGHT: Good, do you see what I'm saying? 
DWIGHT: Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected... 
DWIGHT: Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down. 
DWIGHT: Good, let 'em. It helps our cause. 
DWIGHT: Good, so,   where are you going? 
DWIGHT: Good, we have a deal? 
DWIGHT: Good. 
DWIGHT: Good.

DWIGHT: Good. How are you doing? 
DWIGHT: Good. I need you to make five copies of these.   
DWIGHT: Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch. 
DWIGHT: Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds- 
DWIGHT: Good. Real good. 
DWIGHT: Good. Really really good. 
DWIGHT: Good. They good? 
DWIGHT: Goodbye Jim. And good luck. 
DWIGHT: Goodbye prince family,   should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it.   Bye bye. 
DWIGHT: Goodbye. 
DWIGHT: Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh  No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that? 
DWIGHT: Gosh. He he. 
DWIGHT: Got 'em. Go! 
DWIGHT: Got it. 
DWIGHT: Got it. 
DWIGHT: Got it.  
DWIGHT: Got it.  To Dwight. Wha--  Starbucks gift card. 
DWIGHT: Got it. Carb up. 
DWIGHT: Got it. Go. 
DWIGHT: Got it? 
DWIGHT: Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend. Uncle 
DWIGHT: Gotcha! Why are you late? 
DWIGHT: Gotcha! Yeah! Let s see ya get out of this web, huh? 
DWIGHT: Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts.  Scranton Mimeograph Corp?  I don t think we re doing business with them any time soon. That s odd. A letter from Robert Dunder.  A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.  The Holy Grail. 
DWIGHT: Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it. 
DWIGHT: Great idea. 
DWIGHT: Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table. 
DWIGHT: Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim? 
DWIGHT: Great, right up there. 
DWIGHT: Great. 
DWIGHT: Great. 
DWIGHT: Great. 
DWIGHT: Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again? 
DWIGHT: Great. Get the plate number. 
DWIGHT: Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all. 
DWIGHT: Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold. 
DWIGHT: Gryffindor! Gryffindor! 
DWIGHT: Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction. 
DWIGHT: Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake. 
DWIGHT: Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy? 
DWIGHT: Guilty! Suit Store 
DWIGHT: Guten tag, Herr Michael. 
DWIGHT: Guys, it wasn t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor. 
DWIGHT: Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position. 
DWIGHT: Ha ha!  
DWIGHT: Ha ha! April 13th, 2002. Mr. 
DWIGHT: Ha ha! Yeah, joke s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up! 
DWIGHT: Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo! 
DWIGHT: Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I m eating Jims. 
DWIGHT: Ha! 
DWIGHT: Ha!  This is for real this time. 
DWIGHT: Ha! I don't get it. 
DWIGHT: Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
DWIGHT: Ha, nerd. 
DWIGHT: Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please. 
DWIGHT: Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies. 
DWIGHT: Had 'em all my life. Jim: ..breast pain...  
DWIGHT: Hah! Yah!  Boom! 
DWIGHT: Haha, Mrs. Schrute. 
DWIGHT: Hallowed ground. 
DWIGHT: Hannah Smoterich-Barr. 
DWIGHT: Happy birth moment, Michael. 
DWIGHT: Happy Birthday, Stanley!   
DWIGHT: Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter? 
DWIGHT: Hardy har har. Okay picture 
DWIGHT: Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic! 
DWIGHT: Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous! 
DWIGHT: has brought... 
DWIGHT: Has Michael checked in? 
DWIGHT: Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault. 
DWIGHT: Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote.  Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.   That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you. 
DWIGHT: Have a seat. 
DWIGHT: Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday.  He has no idea! 
DWIGHT: Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two? 
DWIGHT: Have you collected the money from everyone? 
DWIGHT: Have you ever seen a burn victim? 
DWIGHT: Have you ever taken any illegal drugs? 
DWIGHT: Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook? 
DWIGHT: Have you ever... pooped... a balloon? 
DWIGHT: Have you finished with the sketch? 
DWIGHT: Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture? 
DWIGHT: Have you seen Erin? 
DWIGHT: Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions. 
DWIGHT: Having trouble finding a vein? Blood Drive 
DWIGHT: Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked. 
DWIGHT: He -- 
DWIGHT: He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed. 
DWIGHT: He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me? 
DWIGHT: He defecated, aw. Senator 
DWIGHT: He doesn't even know that I do that. 
DWIGHT: He doesn't even want to go. 
DWIGHT: He doesn't like it. 
DWIGHT: He doesn't understand a word you're saying. 
DWIGHT: He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the.. Prince 
DWIGHT: He even looks like a mole. 
DWIGHT: He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question? 
DWIGHT: He hung up? 
DWIGHT: He is a goner. 
DWIGHT: He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat. 
DWIGHT: He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office. 
DWIGHT: He is. 
DWIGHT: He knew all along! 
DWIGHT: He looks great. 
DWIGHT: He looks like your twin. 
DWIGHT: He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him. 
DWIGHT: He put my stuff in Jell-O again. 
DWIGHT: He really is, but not for long.  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on. 
DWIGHT: He s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young. 
DWIGHT: He s fine. He gets carsick really easily. 
DWIGHT: He s like a manatee. Ready? Let s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three!  Oh, God. No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain. 
DWIGHT: He said he would do the same for me. 
DWIGHT: He says Thank you. 
DWIGHT: He says, "No!" Boom! 
DWIGHT: He sure left in a hurry. 
DWIGHT: He thought you were doing an incredible job last month. 
DWIGHT: He took my desk. 
DWIGHT: He used to fight dogs. 
DWIGHT: He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. 
DWIGHT: He was dead the whole time. 
DWIGHT: He was trying to force you to decide on a policy. 
DWIGHT: He wasn't volunteering today. 
DWIGHT: He went over your head to go behind your back. 
DWIGHT: He went to Gabe behind your back. 
DWIGHT: He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing. 
DWIGHT: He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts! 
DWIGHT: He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt. 
DWIGHT: He wouldn't listen to me 
DWIGHT: He/she/it throat rips. 
DWIGHT: Head towards the exits. 
DWIGHT: Hear anything interesting? 
DWIGHT: Heeeere's Dwi- what the-?  Oh man. 
DWIGHT: Hee-heeding this right now. 
DWIGHT: Heh! Ha!   
DWIGHT: He'll die. 
DWIGHT: Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake. 
DWIGHT: Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten. 
DWIGHT: Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP. 
DWIGHT: Hello Phyllis. Do you have a minute? Listen. I'm really sorry... about what I said before. Ok? I was way out of line. 
DWIGHT: Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay. 
DWIGHT: Hello, Angela. 
DWIGHT: Hello, Dwight Schrute? 
DWIGHT: Hello, I would like to apply for a job. Prince 
DWIGHT: Hello, Jan. 
DWIGHT: Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin? 
DWIGHT: Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT: Hello. Jim? 
DWIGHT: Hello? Hello? 
DWIGHT: Hello? Lacerated hand here folks. 
DWIGHT: Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour. 
DWIGHT: Henrietta. 
DWIGHT: Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on. 
DWIGHT: Her face is okay, but-- Jesus! What --what are you doing here? 
DWIGHT: Her kid needs shoes, Jim! 
DWIGHT: Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable. 
DWIGHT: Her name? 
DWIGHT: Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays. 
DWIGHT: Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that. 
DWIGHT: Here s how I m going to help out from now on. I m going to not care, and I m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy s inevitable demise. 
DWIGHT: Here they come. 
DWIGHT: Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty. 
DWIGHT: Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature? 
DWIGHT: Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more. 
DWIGHT: Here we go.  Oh! Wow. 
DWIGHT: Here we go. Make a wish. 
DWIGHT: Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera! 
DWIGHT: Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag.  
DWIGHT: Here, here  Just  
DWIGHT: Here, let me help you.   
DWIGHT: Here's another place. 
DWIGHT: Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord.   
DWIGHT: Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend. 
DWIGHT: Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend. 
DWIGHT: Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent. 
DWIGHT: Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape. 
DWIGHT: He's gonna love it! 
DWIGHT: He's heading downtown. 
DWIGHT: He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain. 
DWIGHT: He's lying. 
DWIGHT: He's not a songbird. 
DWIGHT: He's not coming back, it's over Michael. 
DWIGHT: He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up! 
DWIGHT: He's not kidding. 
DWIGHT: He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported. 
DWIGHT: He's searching out younger gays. 
DWIGHT: He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think! 
DWIGHT: He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo.   Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese? 
DWIGHT: He's very, very handsome. 
DWIGHT: He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that. 
DWIGHT: Hey  You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much? 
DWIGHT: Hey buddy, so every- 
DWIGHT: Hey buddy, what are you up to? 
DWIGHT: Hey buddy. 
DWIGHT: Hey David. 
DWIGHT: Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel? 
DWIGHT: Hey guys. 
DWIGHT: Hey hey hey hey.  I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times. 
DWIGHT: Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way. 
DWIGHT: Hey Jimmy, what's up? 
DWIGHT: Hey Michael, how was your date last night? 
DWIGHT: Hey monkey, what's up? 
DWIGHT: Hey monkey. 
DWIGHT: Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy. 
DWIGHT: Hey Pam. Pam 
DWIGHT: Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick. 
DWIGHT: Hey Santa! 
DWIGHT: Hey shut up. You're dead. 
DWIGHT: Hey stranger. 
DWIGHT: Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left . 
DWIGHT: Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today? 
DWIGHT: Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong. 
DWIGHT: Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven... Dwight and 
DWIGHT: Hey! 
DWIGHT: Hey! 
DWIGHT: Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it! 
DWIGHT: Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip? 
DWIGHT: Hey! It's Angela!  Hey! 
DWIGHT: Hey! It's on the list, everybody. 
DWIGHT: Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour. 
DWIGHT: Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight! 
DWIGHT: Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is? Little 
DWIGHT: Hey, did you SMS text message me? 
DWIGHT: Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character. 
DWIGHT: Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below. 
DWIGHT: Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you. 
DWIGHT: Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis? 
DWIGHT: Hey, he can handle it. 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey! 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey! Seriously?  
DWIGHT: Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered. 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up!  Ow! Why are you sleeping that way? 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch. 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever. 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey. 
DWIGHT: Hey, HEY. 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey. Easy. 
DWIGHT: Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private? 
DWIGHT: Hey, I could get some flares from my car. 
DWIGHT: Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again? 
DWIGHT: Hey, IT guy. 
DWIGHT: Hey, it just takes one! 
DWIGHT: Hey, it's Dwight here. Give me the phone. 
DWIGHT: Hey, it's not a surprise. 
DWIGHT: Hey, Jan. 
DWIGHT: Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it.  
DWIGHT: Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun. 
DWIGHT: Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants. 
DWIGHT: Hey, Michael. 
DWIGHT: Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off. 
DWIGHT: Hey, monkey, how you doing? 
DWIGHT: Hey, Oww!  It's OK. 
DWIGHT: Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to. 
DWIGHT: Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay? Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.   
DWIGHT: Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever. 
DWIGHT: Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in- 
DWIGHT: Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out. 
DWIGHT: Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself? 
DWIGHT: Hey, this is none of your business. 
DWIGHT: Hey, Toby. 
DWIGHT: Hey, we nailed the sale! 
DWIGHT: Hey, what was she like? 
DWIGHT: Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from? 
DWIGHT: Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh? 
DWIGHT: Hey, you wanna win? You gotta fuel like a winner. 
DWIGHT: Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps. 
DWIGHT: Hey, you wanted to see me? 
DWIGHT: Hey, you're making me spray! 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
DWIGHT: Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel. 
DWIGHT: Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby. 
DWIGHT: Hey. Come on, buddy. Let s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don t compare. When you re with the R-O-L-F, you re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor.  
DWIGHT: Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave? 
DWIGHT: Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change. 
DWIGHT: Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him. 
DWIGHT: Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine. 
DWIGHT: Hey. No movement. 
DWIGHT: Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you. 
DWIGHT: Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes. 
DWIGHT: Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck? 
DWIGHT: Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off.  
DWIGHT: Hey... I can't imagine this place without you. 
DWIGHT: Hey... what are you guys doing? 
DWIGHT: Hey... Why did you do it? 
DWIGHT: Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god.  False. Andy, I will volunteer. 
DWIGHT: Hi Daryl. I m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead. 
DWIGHT: Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today. 
DWIGHT: Hi Michael! 
DWIGHT: Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening  I have... 
DWIGHT: Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is   Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say. 
DWIGHT: Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy. 
DWIGHT: Hi, Mr. Bart. 
DWIGHT: Hi, Pam. 
DWIGHT: Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert. 
DWIGHT: Hiii!  
DWIGHT: Him or me? 
DWIGHT: Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore. 
DWIGHT: His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn t see it, or didn t wanna see it. 
DWIGHT: Hit him! Hit him, Chicken. 
DWIGHT: Hit the nos. 
DWIGHT: Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up. 
DWIGHT: Hiya! Ha!  
DWIGHT: Hmm, doesn't seem like the type. 
DWIGHT: Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par.   
DWIGHT: Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique. 
DWIGHT: Hmm. 
DWIGHT: Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office. 
DWIGHT: Hmm. It wasn't here before. 
DWIGHT: Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician. 
DWIGHT: Hmm. Very nice. Very nice. 
DWIGHT: Hmm? 
DWIGHT: Hmm? 
DWIGHT: Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it? 
DWIGHT: Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg. 
DWIGHT: Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot. 
DWIGHT: Hmmm? 
DWIGHT: Ho, thirty years. 
DWIGHT: Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room. 
DWIGHT: Hoist him aloft. C mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl.  
DWIGHT: Hoist his shank on three. 
DWIGHT: Hola, tu es une buena worker? 
DWIGHT: Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there! 
DWIGHT: Hold still, woman! 
DWIGHT: Hold that thought.     March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year. 
DWIGHT: Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here...  You should fire the following people. 
DWIGHT: Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel. 
DWIGHT: Hold your breath. 
DWIGHT: Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael? 
DWIGHT: Hope - grows. 
DWIGHT: Hope to see you soon. 
DWIGHT: Horse Boat. 
DWIGHT: Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead. 
DWIGHT: How about 5:15? 
DWIGHT: How about 911? Anyone? 911.   
DWIGHT: How about now?   
DWIGHT: How about Scrantonstrangler666. 
DWIGHT: How as being a minority affected you? 
DWIGHT: How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing. 
DWIGHT: How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch  
DWIGHT: How close? 
DWIGHT: How could it be more clear? 
DWIGHT: How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation. 
DWIGHT: How dare you all attack him like this. 
DWIGHT: How dare you? 
DWIGHT: How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders! Fake 
DWIGHT: How do I apply? 
DWIGHT: How do I become a manger at Sabre? 
DWIGHT: How do I look? 
DWIGHT: How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample. 
DWIGHT: How do you know it's going to be a boy? 
DWIGHT: How do you know that? 
DWIGHT: How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don t even care about nationals. 
DWIGHT: How is he gonna have grandkids? 
DWIGHT: How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour. 
DWIGHT: How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore? 
DWIGHT: How long before? 
DWIGHT: How long has he been in the bathroom? 
DWIGHT: How many in your party? 
DWIGHT: How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance? 
DWIGHT: How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself. 
DWIGHT: How much do you have? 
DWIGHT: How much longer is this going to take? 
DWIGHT: How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news. 
DWIGHT: How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable. 
DWIGHT: How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company? 
DWIGHT: How would you do that? 
DWIGHT: How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale? 
DWIGHT: How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton? 
DWIGHT: How ya doin'? 
DWIGHT: How ya feeling, better? 
DWIGHT: How you doing, Jordan? 
DWIGHT: How? 
DWIGHT: However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly. 
DWIGHT: How's it hanging? 
DWIGHT: Huh.  Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? . 
DWIGHT: Huh. Do you like candy? 
DWIGHT: Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt. 
DWIGHT: Huh? 
DWIGHT: Huh? You like that? 
DWIGHT: Huh?! 
DWIGHT: Humans are terrible for the environment. 
DWIGHT: Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition. 
DWIGHT: Hungry? 
DWIGHT: Hurl your feces. 
DWIGHT: Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner? 
DWIGHT: Hustle! 
DWIGHT: Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike! 
DWIGHT: I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle! 
DWIGHT: I agree. Yes, crap. Continue. HCT Member 
DWIGHT: I already made an appointment  with your secretary. Mr. 
DWIGHT: I am a farmer Angela. 
DWIGHT: I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries. 
DWIGHT: I am a person. 
DWIGHT: I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei. 
DWIGHT: I am a Sith Lord.  Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars. 
DWIGHT: I am better than you have ever been or ever will be.  
DWIGHT: I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate. 
DWIGHT: I am cool. 
DWIGHT: I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died. 
DWIGHT: I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther. 
DWIGHT: I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color? 
DWIGHT: I am gonna be your new boss.  It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never. 
DWIGHT: I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals. 
DWIGHT: I am hardly the problem, Jim. 
DWIGHT: I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights. 
DWIGHT: I am nigh! 
DWIGHT: I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them. 
DWIGHT: I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro, from Heroes. That's a hero. Also, Bono. 
DWIGHT: I am not a liar. 
DWIGHT: I am not bluffing! 
DWIGHT: I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution. 
DWIGHT: I am not. 
DWIGHT: I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei. 
DWIGHT: I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping. 
DWIGHT: I am ready for my performance review. 
DWIGHT: I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me. 
DWIGHT: I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts. 
DWIGHT: I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has sex with a unicorn? Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse? 
DWIGHT: I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse - 
DWIGHT: I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy. 
DWIGHT: I am trying to bring team spirit. 
DWIGHT: I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions? 
DWIGHT: I apologized for that. 
DWIGHT: I asked you a question. 
DWIGHT: I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased. Mr. 
DWIGHT: I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal. 
DWIGHT: I bet she had hairy armpits. 
DWIGHT: I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race. 
DWIGHT: I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son. 
DWIGHT: I broke it. 
DWIGHT: I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band  The Grass Roots  in the 1960 s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military. 
DWIGHT: I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds? 
DWIGHT: I call for a refold! 
DWIGHT: I can get you exotic meats   hippo steaks, giraffe burgers... 
DWIGHT: I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office. 
DWIGHT: I can handle that. 
DWIGHT: I can handle that. 
DWIGHT: I can make him talk, Michael. 
DWIGHT: I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today. 
DWIGHT: I can protect you from Kelly.  Will you get out of here? Seriously.  
DWIGHT: I can save the branch. 
DWIGHT: I can see that as a very real possibility. 
DWIGHT: I can see that happening, yes. 
DWIGHT: I can see that happening. 
DWIGHT: I can see the security guard's eyes. 
DWIGHT: I can t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me. 
DWIGHT: I can t get it out. Try again! 
DWIGHT: I can t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly. 
DWIGHT: I can t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I ll be launched into space. God, you re so insensitive. 
DWIGHT: I can tell. I won't let you down. 
DWIGHT: I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone. 
DWIGHT: I can try. I m gonna use SMS text. 
DWIGHT: I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons. 
DWIGHT: I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot, any knot. Go ahead. 
DWIGHT: I can't- 
DWIGHT: I can't believe this news. That--- wow. 
DWIGHT: I can't do this. 
DWIGHT: I can't let you in, Michael. 
DWIGHT: I can't see. 
DWIGHT: I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich. Aunt 
DWIGHT: I can't stop this investigation. It is my job. 
DWIGHT: I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken.  Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that? 
DWIGHT: I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam. 
DWIGHT: I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?! Darryl and 
DWIGHT: I can't. I can't push harder! 
DWIGHT: I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway. 
DWIGHT: I can't...  
DWIGHT: I can't... I can't here what you're saying. 
DWIGHT: I checked it more than once. 
DWIGHT: I choose Michael! 
DWIGHT: I chose my words very carefully. 
DWIGHT: I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight. 
DWIGHT: I could have stopped him. 
DWIGHT: I could never do that! 
DWIGHT: I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress. 
DWIGHT: I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it. Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal. 
DWIGHT: I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French. 
DWIGHT: I could tell, from the body language. 
DWIGHT: I could, but I just don t feel like it loser. 
DWIGHT: I could've gotten that, idiot! 
DWIGHT: I d have to get some more wire and string, but it s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable? 
DWIGHT: I d like to give you $100 million.   
DWIGHT: I d love to be in the loop, David. David 
DWIGHT: I date Indian girls. 
DWIGHT: I decided earlier. 
DWIGHT: I demand more questions! 
DWIGHT: I deserve this. You know I do! 
DWIGHT: I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious!  Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah! 
DWIGHT: I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again. 
DWIGHT: I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it. 
DWIGHT: I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt? 
DWIGHT: I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night. 
DWIGHT: I didn't lose my desk. 
DWIGHT: I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work. 
DWIGHT: I didn't order anything. 
DWIGHT: I didn't say anything 
DWIGHT: I didn't sucker punch you, Michael. 
DWIGHT: I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic. David 
DWIGHT: I didn't...  I didn't think you needed them for this part. 
DWIGHT: I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent. 
DWIGHT: I do not have a knife! 
DWIGHT: I do not look worried. 
DWIGHT: I do not respect her, but I will go. 
DWIGHT: I do not! I do not say "Hi" Pam! 
DWIGHT: I do that myself now. 
DWIGHT: I do! I do. I do. I do. I do. 
DWIGHT: I do! I want some man meat! 
DWIGHT: I do, I have to go. Tall Girl 
DWIGHT: I do. 
DWIGHT: I do. But you married my worst enemy. 
DWIGHT: I don t know, what do you mean? 
DWIGHT: I don t like him either. And yet I really like him. 
DWIGHT: I don t need your help. 
DWIGHT: I don t see it. 
DWIGHT: I don't ... have no idea. 
DWIGHT: I don't believe you. Continue. 
DWIGHT: I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure. 
DWIGHT: I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten. 
DWIGHT: I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof.  And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case. 
DWIGHT: I don't even know what to say. 
DWIGHT: I don't get that, I don't understand that. 
DWIGHT: I don't get to wear my ties. 
DWIGHT: I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it. 
DWIGHT: I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog. 
DWIGHT: I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill. 
DWIGHT: I don't know that first things about secret meetings. 
DWIGHT: I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up. 
DWIGHT: I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther. 
DWIGHT: I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!  
DWIGHT: I don't know. 
DWIGHT: I don't know. 
DWIGHT: I don't know. 
DWIGHT: I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.  
DWIGHT: I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable. 
DWIGHT: I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need? 
DWIGHT: I don't need a key. 
DWIGHT: I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will. 
DWIGHT: I don't see it. I think they both could do better. 
DWIGHT: I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer. 
DWIGHT: I don't think she'd be missed. 
DWIGHT: I don't think so. 
DWIGHT: I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on. 
DWIGHT: I don't try and be anything that I'm not. 
DWIGHT: I don't understand the reference. 
DWIGHT: I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid. 
DWIGHT: I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all. 
DWIGHT: I don't understand, why would you buy a policy? 
DWIGHT: I don't wanna move desks! 
DWIGHT: I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls. 
DWIGHT: I don't want people making fun of my nose. 
DWIGHT: I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed 
DWIGHT: I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime. 
DWIGHT: I don't want to do this. 
DWIGHT: I don't want to do your laundry anymore. 
DWIGHT: I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs. 
DWIGHT: I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh.  You don't have a plan. 
DWIGHT: I figured it would save time. 
DWIGHT: I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit. 
DWIGHT: I found it under the seat. 
DWIGHT: I found twins. 
DWIGHT: I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him. 
DWIGHT: I got a knock-knock joke. 
DWIGHT: I got a splinter. 
DWIGHT: I got floor. 
DWIGHT: I got it. 
DWIGHT: I got it. 
DWIGHT: I got it. I got it. 
DWIGHT: I got sofa. I got sofa. 
DWIGHT: I got the surgery, what else is there to do? 
DWIGHT: I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs. 
DWIGHT: I got you, I got you!  
DWIGHT: I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie. 
DWIGHT: I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right. 
DWIGHT: I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn t picture any of them in the old gold and gray. 
DWIGHT: I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger. 
DWIGHT: I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently. 
DWIGHT: I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere.  
DWIGHT: I had fish yesterday. 
DWIGHT: I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt. 
DWIGHT: I had to get your attention. This is an emergency.   
DWIGHT: I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT: I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy! 
DWIGHT: I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix. 
DWIGHT: I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny. 
DWIGHT: I hadn't noticed. 
DWIGHT: I hate her too. 
DWIGHT: I have a copy of your key. 
DWIGHT: I have a girlfriend... 
DWIGHT: I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced. 
DWIGHT: I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried. 
DWIGHT: I have a smudge on my forehead? 
DWIGHT: I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready?  Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning! Dwight and 
DWIGHT: I have absolutely no idea. 
DWIGHT: I have already picked my 
DWIGHT: I have an old barn! 
DWIGHT: I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file. 
DWIGHT: I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag. 
DWIGHT: I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy. 
DWIGHT: I have been my whole life. 
DWIGHT: I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael. 
DWIGHT: I have crossbows. 
DWIGHT: I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that  be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom. 
DWIGHT: I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share.   "Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center." Juvie. "According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..." Blah, Blah, Blah.   
DWIGHT: I have Jim on the record saying that the vic- 
DWIGHT: I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting. 
DWIGHT: I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it. 
DWIGHT: I have no idea. 
DWIGHT: I have no way of knowing if that's true. 
DWIGHT: I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination. 
DWIGHT: I have something to do. 
DWIGHT: I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals. 
DWIGHT: I have to do something to his eyes. 
DWIGHT: I have to go to the hospital. 
DWIGHT: I have to have an emergency crown put in. 
DWIGHT: I have to put you on with my boss. 
DWIGHT: I have to see these shoes. 
DWIGHT: I have two. White and Indian. Mr. 
DWIGHT: I have. 
DWIGHT: I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work. 
DWIGHT: I haven't made a decision yet. 
DWIGHT: I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?   
DWIGHT: I heard you bought a bar, Kevin. 
DWIGHT: I heard you say  well  the first time. 
DWIGHT: I hit a bear. 
DWIGHT: I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs. 
DWIGHT: I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it.  AH!  When... Damn it. 
DWIGHT: I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you. 
DWIGHT: I hope there will be management parables. 
DWIGHT: I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords. 
DWIGHT: I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing. 
DWIGHT: I insist. 
DWIGHT: I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please? 
DWIGHT: I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'. 
DWIGHT: I just don't get it. 
DWIGHT: I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring. 
DWIGHT: I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale. 
DWIGHT: I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in. 
DWIGHT: I just might be his father. 
DWIGHT: I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me.  
DWIGHT: I just really, really think we should handle this internally. 
DWIGHT: I just saved your life. You re welcome! 
DWIGHT: I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills. 
DWIGHT: I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense.  
DWIGHT: I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone. Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days. 
DWIGHT: I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place." Well I say, "It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose." 
DWIGHT: I knew it the whole time, buddy!   
DWIGHT: I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space. 
DWIGHT: I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo!   Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her. 
DWIGHT: I knew it. 
DWIGHT: I knew you would, Nancy. 
DWIGHT: I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good. 
DWIGHT: I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them. 
DWIGHT: I know how it happened.  
DWIGHT: I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth. 
DWIGHT: I know how we can learn his tricks. 
DWIGHT: I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath. 
DWIGHT: I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one! 
DWIGHT: I know just the man for the job.  
DWIGHT: I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know. 
DWIGHT: I know right... what the? 
DWIGHT: I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect. 
DWIGHT: I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so. 
DWIGHT: I know that. Don't you think I know that? 
DWIGHT: I know that's what he said. 
DWIGHT: I know times are tough right now, and I laud your thriftiness.   Ryan! 
DWIGHT: I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way. 
DWIGHT: I know what you'd do with all that money.   Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.  
DWIGHT: I know you did it! 
DWIGHT: I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything. 
DWIGHT: I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently. 
DWIGHT: I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of? 
DWIGHT: I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime. 
DWIGHT: I know. 
DWIGHT: I know. 
DWIGHT: I know. 
DWIGHT: I know.  
DWIGHT: I know.  But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation. 
DWIGHT: I know.  So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh? 
DWIGHT: I know. Evel Knievel. 
DWIGHT: I know. I could just bang you right now. 
DWIGHT: I know. I know exactly what to do. 
DWIGHT: I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom. 
DWIGHT: I know. That s not why I m naked. I always work out without my clothes.  
DWIGHT: I know. You re gonna be okay, Monkey. 
DWIGHT: I know... 
DWIGHT: I left a message at corporate. 
DWIGHT: I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity. 
DWIGHT: I like a little feather in my nuggets.  
DWIGHT: I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent. 
DWIGHT: I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't. 
DWIGHT: I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind? 
DWIGHT: I like to call this... the bumper test.   
DWIGHT: I like where you're going with this. Continue. 
DWIGHT: I ll get my apprehension kit. 
DWIGHT: I ll stall him. Go! 
DWIGHT: I look forward to hearing from you about that job application. 
DWIGHT: I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors. 
DWIGHT: I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends. 
DWIGHT: I love finding a good set of twins. 
DWIGHT: I love that show. Cookie 
DWIGHT: I love working here and I do not want to leave. 
DWIGHT: I love you! 
DWIGHT: I m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We ll be stuck between floors for hours.  Oh.  My pants fell down. 
DWIGHT: I m gonna need to put you on hold for a second.  Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where s Stanley? 
DWIGHT: I m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month. 
DWIGHT: I m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend. 
DWIGHT: I m sorry. I ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun. David 
DWIGHT: I m trying to make him feel important. 
DWIGHT: I m trying, but what you re asking is-- 
DWIGHT: I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it. 
DWIGHT: I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin... 
DWIGHT: I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father. 
DWIGHT: I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy. 
DWIGHT: I might see a movie. 
DWIGHT: I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one. 
DWIGHT: I miss her so much. 
DWIGHT: I missed you Kevin. 
DWIGHT: I most certainly did not. 
DWIGHT: I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd. 
DWIGHT: I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining. 
DWIGHT: I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott. 
DWIGHT: I need to go over some details with you. 
DWIGHT: I need to make a sales call. Please? 
DWIGHT: I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her. 
DWIGHT: I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated. 
DWIGHT: I need you to hose my aunt. 
DWIGHT: I need you to perform a test. 
DWIGHT: I never said it was better than an iPod. 
DWIGHT: I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes 
DWIGHT: I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life. 
DWIGHT: I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent. 
DWIGHT: I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow. 
DWIGHT: I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada. 
DWIGHT: I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice-  to be like this!  But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person. 
DWIGHT: I prefer to stand. Less blood clots. 
DWIGHT: I probably care more than she does. 
DWIGHT: I promise you, that door locks!  
DWIGHT: I put everything back in the vending machine. 
DWIGHT: I really don't think so. 
DWIGHT: I really don't want to take the chill pill.  
DWIGHT: I really hope so.  
DWIGHT: I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow.  Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown. 
DWIGHT: I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever. 
DWIGHT: I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes.  
DWIGHT: I sa-   
DWIGHT: I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14! 
DWIGHT: I said that!   
DWIGHT: I saw that. That's great! 
DWIGHT: I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place. 
DWIGHT: I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it. 
DWIGHT: I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve. 
DWIGHT: I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor. 
DWIGHT: I see dead people. 
DWIGHT: I see Esther's back in town. 
DWIGHT: I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper. 
DWIGHT: I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this. 
DWIGHT: I sell more paper than anyone.   
DWIGHT: I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly.  
DWIGHT: I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick. 
DWIGHT: I started a fire with my cheese pita. 
DWIGHT: I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope. 
DWIGHT: I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family. 
DWIGHT: I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area. 
DWIGHT: I sure do. 
DWIGHT: I take full responsibility. 
DWIGHT: I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them. 
DWIGHT: I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it. 
DWIGHT: I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours. 
DWIGHT: I think I cut my penis on the lid! 
DWIGHT: I think I saw it! 
DWIGHT: I think I should be there. 
DWIGHT: I think it was Creed. 
DWIGHT: I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with. 
DWIGHT: I think I've got one for you.  
DWIGHT: I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory. 
DWIGHT: I think she's efficient. 
DWIGHT: I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD. 
DWIGHT: I think we'll be fine.  
DWIGHT: I think you have the wrong number, Michael. 
DWIGHT: I think you need to confess... 
DWIGHT: I think you re only a teeny  
DWIGHT: I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program. 
DWIGHT: I think you'll find what you're looking for  over there. 
DWIGHT: I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags. 
DWIGHT: I thought he was out on the road. 
DWIGHT: I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how. 
DWIGHT: I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to. 
DWIGHT: I thought it went great. 
DWIGHT: I thought you guys couldn t come. 
DWIGHT: I thought you said yesterday was your birthday! 
DWIGHT: I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day 
DWIGHT: I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy? 
DWIGHT: I throat-rip. 
DWIGHT: I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father- 
DWIGHT: I told you. 
DWIGHT: I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today. 
DWIGHT: I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command. Also, I can retract my penis up into itself.   
DWIGHT: I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options. 
DWIGHT: I ve seen enough. 
DWIGHT: I ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I m an Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT: I volunteered for this job. 
DWIGHT: I want a truce. 
DWIGHT: I want an answer by tomorrow. 
DWIGHT: I want him to have all the urine he needs. 
DWIGHT: I want Michael to take me... 
DWIGHT: I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak? 
DWIGHT: I want that vice-presidency. 
DWIGHT: I want to be here when you fire her ass. 
DWIGHT: I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me. 
DWIGHT: I want to do it. 
DWIGHT: I want to do this. 
DWIGHT: I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out. 
DWIGHT: I want to see the baby. 
DWIGHT: I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, "muffin basket." Then I thought, "What s even more precious to people than muffins?" 
DWIGHT: I wanted to offer you a new position. 
DWIGHT: I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing? 
DWIGHT: I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity.  
DWIGHT: I was -- I was right. 
DWIGHT: I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls. 
DWIGHT: I was here first. Mr. 
DWIGHT: I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me. 
DWIGHT: I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy. 
DWIGHT: I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants. 
DWIGHT: I was just jogging. 
DWIGHT: I was right. 
DWIGHT: I was talking to myself. 
DWIGHT: I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats. Captain 
DWIGHT: I was thinking of proposing to Esther today. 
DWIGHT: I was trying to go- 
DWIGHT: I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was? 
DWIGHT: I was wondering- 
DWIGHT: I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math. 
DWIGHT: I wasn't talking to you, pale-face. 
DWIGHT: I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms. 
DWIGHT: I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location. 
DWIGHT: I will do my voodoo. 
DWIGHT: I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic. 
DWIGHT: I will know. 
DWIGHT: I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager. 
DWIGHT: I will never, ever let you down. David 
DWIGHT: I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works. 
DWIGHT: I will pay you whatever it takes. 
DWIGHT: I will poison your food. 
DWIGHT: I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or...  I don't know. Something always works out.  
DWIGHT: I will stay here and run things on this end. 
DWIGHT: I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I m finished, it s over. 
DWIGHT: I will tell on you. 
DWIGHT: I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you...  Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it.  
DWIGHT: I will trade you for the used candle. 
DWIGHT: I will. 
DWIGHT: I will.  
DWIGHT: I wish I could hire all of you. 
DWIGHT: I wish I could menstruate. 
DWIGHT: I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account. 
DWIGHT: I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah. 
DWIGHT: I won't. 
DWIGHT: I work with Michael. 
DWIGHT: I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen! 
DWIGHT: I would like to arrange a truce. 
DWIGHT: I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office. 
DWIGHT: I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this. 
DWIGHT: I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided. 
DWIGHT: I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really? 
DWIGHT: I would make sure that you were dead. 
DWIGHT: I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years. 
DWIGHT: I would remember. 
DWIGHT: I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother. 
DWIGHT: I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm. 
DWIGHT: I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much. 
DWIGHT: I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit. 
DWIGHT: I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager? 
DWIGHT: I, will, make a difference here. 
DWIGHT: I... 
DWIGHT: I... 
DWIGHT: I... 
DWIGHT: I... I sang her, her favorite songs. 
DWIGHT: I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged? 
DWIGHT: I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace. 
DWIGHT: I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour. 
DWIGHT: I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf. 
DWIGHT: I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading. 
DWIGHT: Idiot! 
DWIGHT: Idiot. 
DWIGHT: Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!? 
DWIGHT: If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ. 
DWIGHT: If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off. 
DWIGHT: If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise. 
DWIGHT: If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides. 
DWIGHT: If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics.  
DWIGHT: If I were you... 
DWIGHT: If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin. 
DWIGHT: If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to. 
DWIGHT: If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang. 
DWIGHT: If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick. 
DWIGHT: If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses. 
DWIGHT: If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me. 
DWIGHT: If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice. 
DWIGHT: If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me. 
DWIGHT: If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime. 
DWIGHT: If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No!  You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate. 
DWIGHT: If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules. 
DWIGHT: If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job. 
DWIGHT: If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy? 
DWIGHT: If you hit another horse, you've dug to far. 
DWIGHT: If you let me run it. 
DWIGHT: If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes. 
DWIGHT: If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear. 
DWIGHT: If you say screw you one more time... 
DWIGHT: If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives? 
DWIGHT: If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself. 
DWIGHT: If you want to tell me - 
DWIGHT: If you want. 
DWIGHT: If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world. 
DWIGHT: Ignore him. He's the local lunatic. 
DWIGHT: I'll ask you a question. 
DWIGHT: I'll be back, I mean... 
DWIGHT: I'll be on top. It's the most important position. 
DWIGHT: I'll call a cab.  
DWIGHT: I'll call you back. 
DWIGHT: I'll do-- 
DWIGHT: I'll do a shot, Michael. 
DWIGHT: I'll do it! I always say, "You want something done right? Ask Dwight." Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head.  
DWIGHT: I'll do the best I can. 
DWIGHT: I'll get someone to take it down. 
DWIGHT: I'll glance at it. 
DWIGHT: I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now. 
DWIGHT: I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up. 
DWIGHT: I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel. 
DWIGHT: I'll have a cup of a coffee. 
DWIGHT: I'll have Pam send out a memo. 
DWIGHT: I'll have to talk to the manager. 
DWIGHT: I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side. 
DWIGHT: I'll order you some cranberry juice. 
DWIGHT: I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions? 
DWIGHT: I'll take that as a no. 
DWIGHT: I'll take the entirety of the second floor. 
DWIGHT: I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat. 
DWIGHT: I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother. 
DWIGHT: I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team. 
DWIGHT: I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar. 
DWIGHT: I'll try and think of one. When... 
DWIGHT: I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter. 
DWIGHT: I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision. 
DWIGHT: I'm a huge fan. Jerome 
DWIGHT: I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul. 
DWIGHT: I'm about to buy this building, you know. 
DWIGHT: I'm all better. 
DWIGHT: I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first. 
DWIGHT: I'm barren, Jim. 
DWIGHT: I'm being sabotaged. 
DWIGHT: I'm breathing heavily. 
DWIGHT: I'm busy. 
DWIGHT: I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him. 
DWIGHT: I'm coming Michael! 
DWIGHT: I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on. 
DWIGHT: I'm fine, I'm totally fine. 
DWIGHT: I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming. 
DWIGHT: I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. 
DWIGHT: I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam... 
DWIGHT: I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data. 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna answer Charles first. 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination. 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay? 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation. Robert 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms... 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring. 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna save you! 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna say 30. 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna set your face on fire. 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna take you home Michael. 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna with the python. 
DWIGHT: I'm gonna write you both up for not working. 
DWIGHT: I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code. 
DWIGHT: I'm great. How are you? 
DWIGHT: I'm Jigsaw, idiot. 
DWIGHT: I'm Jim Halpert.  
DWIGHT: I'm just -- 
DWIGHT: I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find. 
DWIGHT: I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay? 
DWIGHT: I'm just saying... 
DWIGHT: I'm just scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him. Pizza 
DWIGHT: I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself. 
DWIGHT: I'm just... 
DWIGHT: I'm kneading it! 
DWIGHT: I'm losing control of my bladder. 
DWIGHT: I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, "We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them." 
DWIGHT: I'm not a barbarian. 
DWIGHT: I'm not answering it. 
DWIGHT: I'm not answering that. You answer it. 
DWIGHT: I'm not closing the door. 
DWIGHT: I'm not cr-- uhh! 
DWIGHT: I'm not dumb. I'm smart. 
DWIGHT: I'm not familiar with that expression, 
DWIGHT: I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it.  
DWIGHT: I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB.   
DWIGHT: I'm not gonna lie. Lye! 
DWIGHT: I'm not gonna say it. 
DWIGHT: I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine. 
DWIGHT: I'm not-- I'm not following you. 
DWIGHT: I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you. 
DWIGHT: I'm not telling you anything.  Permits are pending.  Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin. 
DWIGHT: I'm not. 
DWIGHT: I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered. 
DWIGHT: I'm ok. Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side. 
DWIGHT: I'm on it! 
DWIGHT: I'm on it. 
DWIGHT: I'm on it. 
DWIGHT: I'm peeing in this empty can. 
DWIGHT: I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there. 
DWIGHT: I'm pumped! 
DWIGHT: I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You? 
DWIGHT: I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house. 
DWIGHT: I'm relaxing. Scram.  
DWIGHT: I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa! 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear.  
DWIGHT: I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God; were you guys making out? 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum.  It would have fit if he had given me another minute. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry, Michael 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that? 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox. Mr. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name. 
DWIGHT: I'm stronger. Captain 
DWIGHT: I'm talking about... hmmm. 
DWIGHT: I'm temporarily lifting the shun. 
DWIGHT: I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan! 
DWIGHT: I'm thirsty! 
DWIGHT: I'm thirsty. 
DWIGHT: I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin. I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients? 
DWIGHT: I'm... I was making it. 
DWIGHT: Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero. 
DWIGHT: Impish or admirable. 
DWIGHT: Impossible to say. I can't see myself. 
DWIGHT: Impossible, I love the law. 
DWIGHT: Impossible. 
DWIGHT: Impossible. He opened it like an ape. 
DWIGHT: Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance. 
DWIGHT: Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me. 
DWIGHT: Impulsivity and inattention to detail. 
DWIGHT: In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.  
DWIGHT: In a way it s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I ll have a grandson. 
DWIGHT: In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song. 
DWIGHT: In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching. 
DWIGHT: In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David. David 
DWIGHT: In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai. 
DWIGHT: In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend Dwight and 
DWIGHT: In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night. 
DWIGHT: In juvie. 
DWIGHT: In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil. 
DWIGHT: In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour. 
DWIGHT: in the Electric City! 
DWIGHT: In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas. 
DWIGHT: In the ocean. 
DWIGHT: In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there s a mini-reunion. A kind of a  where are they now  panel at a local theatre. It ll be nice to see everyone again.  I haven t seen Kevin since we let him go. 
DWIGHT: In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead." Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead. 
DWIGHT: In which direction? 
DWIGHT: In your face! 
DWIGHT: In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list. 
DWIGHT: In. I'm hungry. 
DWIGHT: Inbwit? Yes. 
DWIGHT: Including prep time? 
DWIGHT: Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts. 
DWIGHT: Ingredients. 
DWIGHT: Inspiration. 
DWIGHT: Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper. 
DWIGHT: Interesting choice... 
DWIGHT: Into your- 
DWIGHT: Iris, thank you so much for having me. 
DWIGHT: Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male. 
DWIGHT: Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end. 
DWIGHT: Is everything satisfactory with your stay? 
DWIGHT: Is it by the Sea of Tranquility? 
DWIGHT: Is it called red-vining? 
DWIGHT: Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave? 
DWIGHT: Is it? 
DWIGHT: Is somebody after you? 
DWIGHT: Is that a real fun shooting windmill? 
DWIGHT: Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab? 
DWIGHT: Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice? 
DWIGHT: Is that how they like to get in? 
DWIGHT: Is that the last year the data was available? 
DWIGHT: Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth?   May I? 
DWIGHT: Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings?  I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James! 
DWIGHT: Is that true? 
DWIGHT: Is that what we were doing? 
DWIGHT: Is that where the nanobots like to come in? 
DWIGHT: Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don t see the point. It s so Wall Street. 
DWIGHT: Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us!  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol. 
DWIGHT: Is this Jan? 
DWIGHT: Is this really the best use of our collective time? 
DWIGHT: Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh? 
DWIGHT: Is this your car, Ryan? 
DWIGHT: Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her.  In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2. 
DWIGHT: Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere. 
DWIGHT: Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so... 
DWIGHT: It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise. 
DWIGHT: It can t be more fun than selling paper and paper products. 
DWIGHT: It can t be nothing. 
DWIGHT: It can't mean that! There's a lake there! 
DWIGHT: It could be kind of funny. 
DWIGHT: It did, it did. 
DWIGHT: It does in the state of Pennsylvania. 
DWIGHT: It does, but still no. 
DWIGHT: It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing. 
DWIGHT: It doesn't make any sense. 
DWIGHT: It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive. 
DWIGHT: It goes out automatically at five P.M. 
DWIGHT: It happens occasionally. 
DWIGHT: It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate. 
DWIGHT: It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal. 
DWIGHT: It is my duty... 
DWIGHT: It is my idea. 
DWIGHT: It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas. 
DWIGHT: It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael?  
DWIGHT: It is not "farm boy swill," I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious. 
DWIGHT: It is not a B and B. 
DWIGHT: It is possible that I could be talking about us. 
DWIGHT: It is so on! 
DWIGHT: It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib. 
DWIGHT: It is the situation that we are in now. 
DWIGHT: It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness. 
DWIGHT: It is time to unveil the tree. 
DWIGHT: It is warm feelings. 
DWIGHT: It just doesn't add up. 
DWIGHT: It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find. 
DWIGHT: It means  excellent . And we have begun. 
DWIGHT: It means like this.  
DWIGHT: It means nothing. I need you to do something for me. 
DWIGHT: It means they are not expanding. 
DWIGHT: It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out.  Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you. 
DWIGHT: It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel. 
DWIGHT: It s 15 feet down, it s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it s like your catching a medicine  
DWIGHT: It s a colloquial way of saying  you re fired,  Kevin, which you are. 
DWIGHT: It s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley? 
DWIGHT: It s a root you idiot. 
DWIGHT: It s a youtube thing! Let s go. Let s go. Come on, they re coming. 
DWIGHT: It s all right. Andy approved it. 
DWIGHT: It s by the tenderloin. 
DWIGHT: It s him! Do something! Get out! 
DWIGHT: It s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd. 
DWIGHT: It s just one thing. Just let me let me do this  David 
DWIGHT: It s moments away. Just stay here! 
DWIGHT: It s the second easiest job in the world.  Being a mom. 
DWIGHT: It s true. 
DWIGHT: It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical. 
DWIGHT: It smells like chicken soup. 
DWIGHT: It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps. 
DWIGHT: It was amazing. I wish you would have been there. 
DWIGHT: It was Andy's idea. 
DWIGHT: It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep. 
DWIGHT: It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi... 
DWIGHT: It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder? 
DWIGHT: It was his birthday, just turned three. So  Suit Store 
DWIGHT: It was my pants. 
DWIGHT: It was nothing personal. It s just that you were terrible at your job. 
DWIGHT: It was playful hazing. 
DWIGHT: It was pretty awesome. 
DWIGHT: It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive. 
DWIGHT: It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour. 
DWIGHT: It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas. 
DWIGHT: It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this. 
DWIGHT: It will just take a second. 
DWIGHT: It worked. 
DWIGHT: It would be better if you were unconscious. 
DWIGHT: It.  That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that. 
DWIGHT: It'll all be goat. 
DWIGHT: It's $475! Like candy from a baby! 
DWIGHT: It's a common question. 
DWIGHT: It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise. 
DWIGHT: It's a divet... 
DWIGHT: It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed. 
DWIGHT: It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards. 
DWIGHT: It's a good market. Higher volume. 
DWIGHT: It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune. 
DWIGHT: It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free?  Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits? 
DWIGHT: It's a job interview, not a flea market. 
DWIGHT: It's a lullaby. 
DWIGHT: It's a miracle. 
DWIGHT: It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane. 
DWIGHT: It's a punishment.  Hey, where are you going? 
DWIGHT: It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work. 
DWIGHT: It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars. 
DWIGHT: It's a statement of fact. 
DWIGHT: It's a terrible idea. 
DWIGHT: It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male. 
DWIGHT: It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation. 
DWIGHT: It's about adapting to the circumstances. 
DWIGHT: It's about Michael. 
DWIGHT: It's about this very announcement you just made. 
DWIGHT: It's actually better this way. 
DWIGHT: It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home.  
DWIGHT: It's all right. It's all right. 
DWIGHT: It's all yours.  Ah!  
DWIGHT: It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else. 
DWIGHT: It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not? 
DWIGHT: It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months. 
DWIGHT: It's been a long time since we've come down here separately. 
DWIGHT: Its business, not personal.   
DWIGHT: It's by the ream? 
DWIGHT: It's called a costume. 
DWIGHT: It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away. 
DWIGHT: It's Christmas Toby. 
DWIGHT: It's close. 
DWIGHT: It's complicated. 
DWIGHT: It's early bird gets the worm. 
DWIGHT: It's easy. That's what I'm saying. 
DWIGHT: It's fine. What? 
DWIGHT: It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song. 
DWIGHT: It's from both of us. 
DWIGHT: It's going to be ok. 
DWIGHT: It's going very well. 
DWIGHT: It's Goldenface. 
DWIGHT: It's good that its cold it will drive business inside. 
DWIGHT: It's gorgeous. Let's go! 
DWIGHT: It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose. 
DWIGHT: It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it- 
DWIGHT: It's in Maryland. 
DWIGHT: It's in the name. 
DWIGHT: Its Jim and Pam, Michael. 
DWIGHT: It's just for family. 
DWIGHT: It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor. 
DWIGHT: It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun. 
DWIGHT: It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family. 
DWIGHT: It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what? 
DWIGHT: It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know? 
DWIGHT: It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black.  
DWIGHT: It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs. 
DWIGHT: It's my car now. 
DWIGHT: It's non-transferable... 
DWIGHT: It's not a doomsday device, gosh.  We can do this you guys. Warehouse 
DWIGHT: It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?! 
DWIGHT: It's not effeminate. It's festive. 
DWIGHT: It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim.   If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind. 
DWIGHT: It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male. 
DWIGHT: It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas. 
DWIGHT: It's not rabid. 
DWIGHT: It's not really 1992 anymore. 
DWIGHT: It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man. 
DWIGHT: It's not safe. Anything could have been in there.  Nice try. 
DWIGHT: It's not the greatest one either... 
DWIGHT: It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah!   
DWIGHT: It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired. 
DWIGHT: It's nothing, I'm robbing her. 
DWIGHT: It's OK guys, she's no longer horny. 
DWIGHT: It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules. 
DWIGHT: It's okay, I smell. 
DWIGHT: It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.  
DWIGHT: It's only Meredith. 
DWIGHT: It's only twenty-five bucks. 
DWIGHT: Its over, Michael, its over.   
DWIGHT: It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation. 
DWIGHT: It's pony. 
DWIGHT: It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket. 
DWIGHT: It's real slippery out here.  
DWIGHT: Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them. 
DWIGHT: It's simpler this way. 
DWIGHT: It's small, I know. 
DWIGHT: It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here! 
DWIGHT: It's that easy? 
DWIGHT: It's too small. 
DWIGHT: It's totally unrealistic. There are no lines in the parking lot. 
DWIGHT: It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really. 
DWIGHT: It's true. 
DWIGHT: It's true. We all walk alone. 
DWIGHT: It's uh, it's in beta testing. 
DWIGHT: It's very good for you.  
DWIGHT: It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them. 
DWIGHT: I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best. 
DWIGHT: I've been in showtime mode since breakfast. 
DWIGHT: I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon.  Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars.  
DWIGHT: I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser. 
DWIGHT: I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing. 
DWIGHT: I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner! 
DWIGHT: I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything. 
DWIGHT: I've got a Madlib for 
DWIGHT: I've got a treat for you! 
DWIGHT: I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up. 
DWIGHT: I've got the key. 
DWIGHT: I've had intercourse in the office. 
DWIGHT: I've said too much. 
DWIGHT: I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp. Pizza 
DWIGHT: I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter. 
DWIGHT: Jackpot. 
DWIGHT: Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's. 
DWIGHT: Jan knows paper. 
DWIGHT: Jan Levinson-Gould. 
DWIGHT: Jan, have you ever had deer? 
DWIGHT: Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes. 
DWIGHT: Jan's here. 
DWIGHT: Jeb, my brother. 
DWIGHT: Jeez! What s he doing in there?  
DWIGHT: Jethro Tull... 
DWIGHT: Jim -- 
DWIGHT: Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK. 
DWIGHT: Jim couldn t land me in a thousand years. 
DWIGHT: Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party. 
DWIGHT: Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here!  I judge your year as impish.  
DWIGHT: Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that. 
DWIGHT: Jim is essential to th- 
DWIGHT: Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it? 
DWIGHT: Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But- 
DWIGHT: Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen. 
DWIGHT: Jim talked too much. 
DWIGHT: Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online. 
DWIGHT: Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him! 
DWIGHT: Jim wha  Come on! What what are you gonna whack me, Jim? 
DWIGHT: Jim won't sign my expense report. 
DWIGHT: Jim! 
DWIGHT: Jim! 
DWIGHT: Jim! 
DWIGHT: Jim! 
DWIGHT: Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let...  
DWIGHT: Jim! Enough with the classy, ok? 
DWIGHT: Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products? 
DWIGHT: Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red. 
DWIGHT: Jim! Jim! What... What's happening? 
DWIGHT: Jim! Open the door! 
DWIGHT: Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork. 
DWIGHT: Jim! You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock? 
DWIGHT: Jim, are you serious? 
DWIGHT: Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the-  
DWIGHT: Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned. 
DWIGHT: Jim, get him a water. 
DWIGHT: Jim, get ready for the battle of your life. 
DWIGHT: Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It s got a hula skirt and a blue nose. 
DWIGHT: Jim, how dare you.  
DWIGHT: Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times. 
DWIGHT: Jim, put those away. 
DWIGHT: Jim, right here, right here.  Okay, good. 
DWIGHT: Jim, shut the door. This is just gross. 
DWIGHT: Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant- 
DWIGHT: Jim, what are you doing? 
DWIGHT: Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy. 
DWIGHT: Jim, what do you say? 
DWIGHT: Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first. 
DWIGHT: Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task. 
DWIGHT: Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them. 
DWIGHT: Jim. 
DWIGHT: Jim. 
DWIGHT: Jim. 
DWIGHT: Jim. Definitely. 
DWIGHT: Jim. I m not kidding. I need you. 
DWIGHT: Jim. Look I m eating you. 
DWIGHT: Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right? 
DWIGHT: Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior. 
DWIGHT: Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today. 
DWIGHT: Jonas. 
DWIGHT: Judas. 
DWIGHT: Just a formality. 
DWIGHT: Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair. 
DWIGHT: Just act natural.  
DWIGHT: Just admit you lost track of time. 
DWIGHT: Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate. 
DWIGHT: Just doing my job. 
DWIGHT: Just for a minute. 
DWIGHT: Just for fun? 
DWIGHT: Just going to walk over here-  whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to!  
DWIGHT: Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head. 
DWIGHT: Just hush. 
DWIGHT: Just ignore him. 
DWIGHT: Just kidding. You finding everything okay? 
DWIGHT: Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior. 
DWIGHT: Just lice Pam? 
DWIGHT: Just now. 
DWIGHT: Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask? 
DWIGHT: just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans? 
DWIGHT: Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick...  I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair. 
DWIGHT: Just put "The Hospital." Contact 
DWIGHT: Just rock. Shh. 
DWIGHT: Just run! Take the stairs! 
DWIGHT: Just say it. 
DWIGHT: Just slip it off my Slip it off my hips. 
DWIGHT: Just the one window? 
DWIGHT: Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah!  See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it. 
DWIGHT: Just trying to be helpful. 
DWIGHT: Just ugly enough to have deniability. 
DWIGHT: Just wait and send it to voicemail. David 
DWIGHT: Just, write it down, please. 
DWIGHT: Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings! 
DWIGHT: Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers! 
DWIGHT: K, I m gonna need some help. Pam? 
DWIGHT: K. I brought cheese too. 
DWIGHT: K... Kevin!  
DWIGHT: Karen Filippelli. 
DWIGHT: Kathy. 
DWIGHT: 'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket!   Okay. 
DWIGHT: Keep an existing... 
DWIGHT: Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets  Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it. 
DWIGHT: Keep the wing flaps. 
DWIGHT: Keep them. 
DWIGHT: Kelly is disqualified! 
DWIGHT: Kelly is the only applicant. 
DWIGHT: Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate. 
DWIGHT: Kelly? 
DWIGHT: Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm! 
DWIGHT: Kevin Costner. 
DWIGHT: Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out.  Spit... Okay, come on, let's go. 
DWIGHT: Kevin! Damnit  Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon - 
DWIGHT: Kevin! Do more stupid faces. 
DWIGHT: Kevin! Doesn't apply. 
DWIGHT: Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf. 
DWIGHT: Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer. 
DWIGHT: Kevin, not now. 
DWIGHT: Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine? 
DWIGHT: KGB. 
DWIGHT: KGB. 
DWIGHT: Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only 
DWIGHT: Kind of. 
DWIGHT: Kiyah! 
DWIGHT: Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper. 
DWIGHT: Knight Rider. 
DWIGHT: Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us. 
DWIGHT: Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you. 
DWIGHT: Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. 
DWIGHT: Know what? 
DWIGHT: Kung-fu movies! 
DWIGHT: La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour! 
DWIGHT: Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo!  
DWIGHT: Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper. 
DWIGHT: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA! 
DWIGHT: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott.  Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers!  Was that part of the...? 
DWIGHT: Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab  em on in there.  
DWIGHT: Lake Erie. 
DWIGHT: Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot. 
DWIGHT: Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy. 
DWIGHT: Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted "We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants. 
DWIGHT: Last thing I need is luck.  
DWIGHT: Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first 
DWIGHT: Last week I gave a fire safety talk.   And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.   Today, smoking is gonna save lives.   
DWIGHT: Last year, idiot!   
DWIGHT: Later on. 
DWIGHT: Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey. 
DWIGHT: Leave me alone and get the male stripper. 
DWIGHT: Leave the keys! 
DWIGHT: Leave the keys. 
DWIGHT: Leave, get outta here. 
DWIGHT: Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous. 
DWIGHT: Let me check.   Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together. 
DWIGHT: Let me float something out there, okay? Can I just say-- can I say something? 
DWIGHT: Let me get that door for you--  
DWIGHT: Let me get that for you.  
DWIGHT: Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it. 
DWIGHT: Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie ? Lick the spoon? 
DWIGHT: Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too "meh" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup?  We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you! 
DWIGHT: Let me out or you're fired. 
DWIGHT: Let me out. 
DWIGHT: Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit. 
DWIGHT: Let me see you jump.  Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that. 
DWIGHT: Let me see. 
DWIGHT: Let me smell.  Good, not great. 
DWIGHT: Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's. 
DWIGHT: Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a 
DWIGHT: Let s get him inside. 
DWIGHT: Let s go right to the top of the stairs, okay? 
DWIGHT: Let s just forget it. Forget it.  
DWIGHT: Let the bedbugs bite! 
DWIGHT: Let's do it! 
DWIGHT: Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off. 
DWIGHT: Let's do this thing. 
DWIGHT: Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom. 
DWIGHT: Let's get back to work. 
DWIGHT: Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs. 
DWIGHT: Let's get the party started.  
DWIGHT: Let's get this roof going. 
DWIGHT: Let's get to it. 
DWIGHT: Let's go check out the master bedroom. 
DWIGHT: Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now! 
DWIGHT: Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds 
DWIGHT: Let's go! 
DWIGHT: Let's go! 
DWIGHT: Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move. 
DWIGHT: Let's go. 
DWIGHT: Let's go. 
DWIGHT: Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake. 
DWIGHT: Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see. 
DWIGHT: Let's move! Move, move, move, move! 
DWIGHT: Let's see if any of these will work.  
DWIGHT: Let's see yours. 
DWIGHT: Let's talk pubes, people. 
DWIGHT: Like a wolf. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Like an AIDS test? 
DWIGHT: Like Angela in accounting. 
DWIGHT: Like baboons or elephants. 
DWIGHT: Like hell you are. 
DWIGHT: Like in a cup? 
DWIGHT: Like the spirit of Christmas! 
DWIGHT: Like this? Watch. 
DWIGHT: Like those? 
DWIGHT: Like who? Who doesn't know? 
DWIGHT: Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy. 
DWIGHT: Limbo, whoo! Captain 
DWIGHT: Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate.   
DWIGHT: Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people. 
DWIGHT: Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it? 
DWIGHT: Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.   
DWIGHT: Listen to me! I love you! And I don t care that Phillip s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you! 
DWIGHT: Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please. 
DWIGHT: Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right? 
DWIGHT: Listen up kid.  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights. 
DWIGHT: Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This...  is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch. 
DWIGHT: Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants. 
DWIGHT: Listen up. Let's start... from the ground up. Where does paper come from? 
DWIGHT: Listen, can I talk to you for a second? 
DWIGHT: Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him. 
DWIGHT: Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier. 
DWIGHT: Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business. 
DWIGHT: Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what? 
DWIGHT: Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis. 
DWIGHT: Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go. 
DWIGHT: Listen.  Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin. 
DWIGHT: Listening. 
DWIGHT: Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day.  I don't feel anything. Nothing.  You're so weak.  Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay? 
DWIGHT: Little of this, little of that. 
DWIGHT: Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres. 
DWIGHT: Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to   how do I put this   steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud. 
DWIGHT: Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core. 
DWIGHT: Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities... 
DWIGHT: Lock your door! 
DWIGHT: Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Pssh. You're like the guy who invented the seat belt. 
DWIGHT: Look  I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us. 
DWIGHT: Look at him. I ve never seen such a beautiful child. Mrs. 
DWIGHT: Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I m telling you... if you don t do this,  I don t stand a chance. Please, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Look at that one. 
DWIGHT: Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone. 
DWIGHT: Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me. 
DWIGHT: Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right.  One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you  will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be. 
DWIGHT: Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar. 
DWIGHT: Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just,   Boom. 
DWIGHT: Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go.  I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry. 
DWIGHT: Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box. 
DWIGHT: Look, I have no problem with women. It s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don t lie about your shoulders! 
DWIGHT: Look, I will not pay. 
DWIGHT: Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you. 
DWIGHT: Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore. 
DWIGHT: Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over. 
DWIGHT: Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass. 
DWIGHT: Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples.  Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh.  
DWIGHT: Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there. 
DWIGHT: Loser. 
DWIGHT: Losers. 
DWIGHT: Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me. 
DWIGHT: Louder! You re shouting it from the back of a horse! 
DWIGHT: Loyalty. 
DWIGHT: Lunch. 
DWIGHT: Made copies of it- 
DWIGHT: Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh!  
DWIGHT: Make a decision. 
DWIGHT: Make him be quiet. 
DWIGHT: Make way, nope, inspect me. 
DWIGHT: Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial 
DWIGHT: Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me. 
DWIGHT: Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair. 
DWIGHT: Man, what is taking Toby so long? 
DWIGHT: Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check  on that later today. This is my grandmother s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother s buttock bullet ring. 
DWIGHT: Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch. 
DWIGHT: Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse. 
DWIGHT: Many of your blouses are Claiborne's. 
DWIGHT: May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately? 
DWIGHT: May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: May I have your attention? The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke. 
DWIGHT: May I please speak to your boss? 
DWIGHT: May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling. 
DWIGHT: Maybe he's going to church. Or court. 
DWIGHT: Maybe if you listened a little bit, you d improve. No wonder women despise you. 
DWIGHT: Maybe it's what she does here... 
DWIGHT: Maybe over a beer after she s closed her first sale . 
DWIGHT: Maybe that's how you die. 
DWIGHT: Maybe that's why he became a dentist. 
DWIGHT: Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son. 
DWIGHT: Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around. 
DWIGHT: Maybe you do. Hi. I m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it. 
DWIGHT: Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection. 
DWIGHT: Maybe you should. Whatever. 
DWIGHT: Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say? 
DWIGHT: Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me. 
DWIGHT: Maybe you've got mono. 
DWIGHT: Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy? 
DWIGHT: Me too.   
DWIGHT: Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst? 
DWIGHT: Me! Me, me, me. Captain 
DWIGHT: Me. 
DWIGHT: Me. 
DWIGHT: Meat grinder. 
DWIGHT: Meet me in our spot in four minutes. 
DWIGHT: Meet my eye line, Jim! 
DWIGHT: Mega-Desk. 
DWIGHT: Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low. 
DWIGHT: Men find me desirable. 
DWIGHT: Men find me desirable. 
DWIGHT: Menstrual cycles. 
DWIGHT: Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar? 
DWIGHT: Merry Christmas!  
DWIGHT: Merry Christmas. 
DWIGHT: Merry Christmas. Good. 
DWIGHT: Message in a Bottle, The Postman... 
DWIGHT: Mi- 
DWIGHT: Michael- 
DWIGHT: Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time. 
DWIGHT: Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto. 
DWIGHT: Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend. 
DWIGHT: Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because... 
DWIGHT: Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market. So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still... 
DWIGHT: Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here.  I hope he finds it.  Lunch. 
DWIGHT: Michael is gone. 
DWIGHT: Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us! 
DWIGHT: Michael is your superior. 
DWIGHT: Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand. 
DWIGHT: Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it? 
DWIGHT: Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation. 
DWIGHT: Michael would never let me... 
DWIGHT: Michael! 
DWIGHT: Michael!  
DWIGHT: Michael!  Michael. Michael ... 
DWIGHT: Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!  
DWIGHT: Michael! Michael! 
DWIGHT: Michael! Michael!  There's an emergency in the warehouse. 
DWIGHT: Michael! My water's breaking! 
DWIGHT: Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No! 
DWIGHT: Michael! Repeat what you said louder! 
DWIGHT: Michael! What's wrong? 
DWIGHT: Michael!? 
DWIGHT: Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa? 
DWIGHT: Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team. 
DWIGHT: Michael, can you explain? 
DWIGHT: Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse? 
DWIGHT: Michael, come on. 
DWIGHT: Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and - 
DWIGHT: Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria! 
DWIGHT: Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company. 
DWIGHT: Michael, I don't know... 
DWIGHT: Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first. 
DWIGHT: Michael, I have so much to learn from you. 
DWIGHT: Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day. 
DWIGHT: Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight. 
DWIGHT: Michael, I would like to be the elf. 
DWIGHT: Michael, I... 
DWIGHT: Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount? 
DWIGHT: Michael, it's Phyllis. 
DWIGHT: Michael, it's time. 
DWIGHT: Michael, look.  Missed it... 
DWIGHT: Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No.   
DWIGHT: Michael, nice tie or something. 
DWIGHT: Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down. 
DWIGHT: Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself. 
DWIGHT: Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause. 
DWIGHT: Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time? 
DWIGHT: Michael, wait. Let me go. 
DWIGHT: Michael, we have a situation. 
DWIGHT: Michael, what time should I be arriving? 
DWIGHT: Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever. 
DWIGHT: Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel? 
DWIGHT: Michael, you know I can't take this. 
DWIGHT: Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here? 
DWIGHT: Michael. 
DWIGHT: Michael. 
DWIGHT: Michael. 
DWIGHT: Michael. 
DWIGHT: Michael. 
DWIGHT: Michael. 
DWIGHT: Michael. 
DWIGHT: Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean. 
DWIGHT: Michael. Michael? 
DWIGHT: Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short. 
DWIGHT: Michael...  You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm?  
DWIGHT: Michael... Hotel 
DWIGHT: Michael? 
DWIGHT: Michael? 
DWIGHT: Michael? 
DWIGHT: Michael? 
DWIGHT: Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in. 
DWIGHT: Michael? Please! Come on! 
DWIGHT: Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years. 
DWIGHT: Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange! 
DWIGHT: Might get ugly. 
DWIGHT: Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute. 
DWIGHT: Mine are at home in a display case above my bed. 
DWIGHT: Mine was green. 
DWIGHT: Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey! 
DWIGHT: MIS... MI... What are you doing? 
DWIGHT: Mm hm. 
DWIGHT: Mm, good stuff. 
DWIGHT: Mm, great cake. 
DWIGHT: Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us. 
DWIGHT: Mm. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat. 
DWIGHT: Mmhmm. 
DWIGHT: Mmhmm. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hmm. Good luck. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hmm. Good safe? 
DWIGHT: Mmm hmm. 
DWIGHT: Mmm!  There we go. 
DWIGHT: Mmm. Maybe I should get one. 
DWIGHT: Mmm. That s a good  question. 300 times   180  Um that comes to 25 minutes.  Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you. 
DWIGHT: Mmm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: Mmm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT: Mmm-uh-mm  
DWIGHT: Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard. 
DWIGHT: Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT: Monkey.   
DWIGHT: More like, "Aye, aye, General." 
DWIGHT: More of a, barbaric growl. 
DWIGHT: Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you. 
DWIGHT: Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore. 
DWIGHT: Mose! What..ooh, Mose.  
DWIGHT: Mose, bags! Now! 
DWIGHT: Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow! 
DWIGHT: Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling? 
DWIGHT: Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house.  Right here. It's all for me. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Motel 6? Best Western? 
DWIGHT: Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this. 
DWIGHT: Move it! One, two, three.  
DWIGHT: Move to the exits! 
DWIGHT: Move to the side of the road! 
DWIGHT: Movie idea? 
DWIGHT: MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD! 
DWIGHT: MR. JAMES HALPERT! 
DWIGHT: MR. JAMES HALPERT! 
DWIGHT: Mr. Peanut is not classy. 
DWIGHT: Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal. Mr. 
DWIGHT: MR. RYAN HOWARD! 
DWIGHT: Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life? 
DWIGHT: My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt. 
DWIGHT: My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings.   
DWIGHT: My calls? 
DWIGHT: My cervix is ripening. 
DWIGHT: My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph!  Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed. 
DWIGHT: My eyes! 
DWIGHT: My eyes! 
DWIGHT: My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out. 
DWIGHT: My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher. 
DWIGHT: My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer? 
DWIGHT: My first order of 
DWIGHT: My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name? 
DWIGHT: My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious. 
DWIGHT: My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats. 
DWIGHT: My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys. 
DWIGHT: My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ... 
DWIGHT: My headphones are broken. 
DWIGHT: My hip bone! 
DWIGHT: My idea! 
DWIGHT: My idea. I just need Andy to think it's his idea. So it won't get traced back to me. In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace. He will be fired. 
DWIGHT: My pants fell down! I don t have a belt! 
DWIGHT: My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago. 
DWIGHT: My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace! 
DWIGHT: My title has 'Manager' in it. 
DWIGHT: My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building. 
DWIGHT: My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms. 
DWIGHT: My wound hasn't healed yet. 
DWIGHT: My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years! 
DWIGHT: N... it's complicated. 
DWIGHT: Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better. Woman at 
DWIGHT: Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched. 
DWIGHT: Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies. 
DWIGHT: Nametag? 
DWIGHT: Natch.  
DWIGHT: Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I m hesitant. Why can t I pull the trigger on any of them? 
DWIGHT: Need any help? 
DWIGHT: Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding? 
DWIGHT: Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it!  
DWIGHT: Nein. Sits.  Goot. 
DWIGHT: Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left. 
DWIGHT: Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato. 
DWIGHT: Never mind. Just never mind. 
DWIGHT: Never! 
DWIGHT: Never!   Get out and face me like a man! 
DWIGHT: New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy? 
DWIGHT: New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos. 
DWIGHT: New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let s go. 
DWIGHT: Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you. 
DWIGHT: Next suggestion. 
DWIGHT: Next suggestion. 
DWIGHT: Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I ve got big expectations, Mose-wise. 
DWIGHT: Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars. 
DWIGHT: Nice job on the cake, Bozo! 
DWIGHT: Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy!  
DWIGHT: Nice to see you. May I hold him? Senator 
DWIGHT: Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today. 
DWIGHT: Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try. 
DWIGHT: Nice, very nice. 
DWIGHT: Nice. 
DWIGHT: Nice. 
DWIGHT: Nice. 
DWIGHT: Nice. Do you have any blonde women? 
DWIGHT: Nine and three-quarters. 
DWIGHT: Nnnnn, that's not... okay. 
DWIGHT: Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions... 
DWIGHT: N-no one would take hedded of my instructions. 
DWIGHT: N-no there's not. 
DWIGHT: N-nothing you need to know the details of. 
DWIGHT: No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved. 
DWIGHT: No communication with the outside world Jim. 
DWIGHT: No doy! 
DWIGHT: No holding. 
DWIGHT: No I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it "murder." And not "muck-duck." 
DWIGHT: No I don't. 
DWIGHT: No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying! 
DWIGHT: No it is not. 
DWIGHT: No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing.   It's like children singing Christmas carols. 
DWIGHT: No kidding. 
DWIGHT: No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you! 
DWIGHT: No need to thank me. 
DWIGHT: No need we can just check the security tapes. 
DWIGHT: No no no the first part. 
DWIGHT: No no no, I can't let you do this! 
DWIGHT: No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307. 
DWIGHT: No no no. 
DWIGHT: No no, he's doing it to catch the president! 
DWIGHT: No no, no, wait, wait, wait  Permission to join the Validity Committee. 
DWIGHT: No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God. 
DWIGHT: No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim. 
DWIGHT: No one just called you. 
DWIGHT: No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible. 
DWIGHT: No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom. 
DWIGHT: No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette? 
DWIGHT: No questions. 
DWIGHT: No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on! 
DWIGHT: No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer. 
DWIGHT: No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself.  
DWIGHT: No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear. 
DWIGHT: No thank you. 
DWIGHT: No thank you. 
DWIGHT: No thank you. 
DWIGHT: No thanks I'm stuffed. 
DWIGHT: No thanks. 
DWIGHT: No the other thing. 
DWIGHT: No trades. 
DWIGHT: No wait, what are you doing?! 
DWIGHT: No way! 
DWIGHT: No way, it's the KGB. 
DWIGHT: No way. 
DWIGHT: No way. 
DWIGHT: No way. What if I meet someone? 
DWIGHT: No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is. Mr. 
DWIGHT: No women or children, unless provoked. 
DWIGHT: No word from Michael. 
DWIGHT: No you cannot. It has to be official, and it has to be urine. 
DWIGHT: No you can't do that. 
DWIGHT: No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine.  What?! 
DWIGHT: No you do not. 
DWIGHT: No you're not. 
DWIGHT: NO! 
DWIGHT: No! 
DWIGHT: No! 
DWIGHT: No! 
DWIGHT: No! 
DWIGHT: No! 
DWIGHT: No! 
DWIGHT: No! 
DWIGHT: No!  
DWIGHT: No!   
DWIGHT: No!   
DWIGHT: No!  Pam, I'm over here! 
DWIGHT: No!  What do you think you're doing? 
DWIGHT: No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is for Kevin. 
DWIGHT: No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal? 
DWIGHT: No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael. 
DWIGHT: No! I don't want natural! 
DWIGHT: No! It's okay. I will do this Michael. 
DWIGHT: No! Michael, no! 
DWIGHT: No! No no! 
DWIGHT: No! No! 
DWIGHT: No! No, Michael! No! Touch the handle. If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway. 
DWIGHT: No! No, no!  
DWIGHT: No! No, Oscar. He s a friend. He s a friend. 
DWIGHT: No! Really? 
DWIGHT: No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side. Gym 
DWIGHT: No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman. 
DWIGHT: No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on? 
DWIGHT: No! You re not helping, Trevor! 
DWIGHT: No! You'll thank me later. 
DWIGHT: No, absolutely not. 
DWIGHT: No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it.  Jim, let go. Let go. 
DWIGHT: No, but that's sometimes part of it. 
DWIGHT: No, but we should discuss that another time. 
DWIGHT: No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat. 
DWIGHT: No, don t say it. You re fired! You re both fired! 
DWIGHT: No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes. 
DWIGHT: No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those. 
DWIGHT: No, everything's fine. 
DWIGHT: No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt! 
DWIGHT: No, he shouldn t. 
DWIGHT: No, hmmm... that's still... 
DWIGHT: No, I can't... I ca... 
DWIGHT: No, I didn't. 
DWIGHT: No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks. 
DWIGHT: No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate. 
DWIGHT: No, I have not. 
DWIGHT: No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright? Tall Girl 
DWIGHT: No, I insist. 
DWIGHT: No, I like Meredith. 
DWIGHT: No, I mean, what do you say to my plan?  Okay. 
DWIGHT: No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh.  
DWIGHT: No, I said one of them is not a nickel. 
DWIGHT: No, I wanna seduce her. 
DWIGHT: No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking? 
DWIGHT: No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective. 
DWIGHT: No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape. 
DWIGHT: No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder  
DWIGHT: No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge. 
DWIGHT: No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things. 
DWIGHT: No, impish or admirable. 
DWIGHT: No, it s not. Here s how we find out. Let s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let s just size each other up here and left side of the list  ATTACK! 
DWIGHT: No, it was not! 
DWIGHT: No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern? 
DWIGHT: No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic. 
DWIGHT: No, it's an accountability booster. 
DWIGHT: No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders. 
DWIGHT: No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long. 
DWIGHT: No, it's free during the day. It's fine. 
DWIGHT: No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires. 
DWIGHT: No, it's marijuana. 
DWIGHT: No, it's not. 
DWIGHT: No, it's--- there's no road here!  
DWIGHT: No, it's... involves the photograph. 
DWIGHT: No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything. 
DWIGHT: No, Jim, the butt, in his butt. 
DWIGHT: No, Kevin, come on. 
DWIGHT: No, like you. 
DWIGHT: No, Michael! 
DWIGHT: No, Michael, you were sabotaged. 
DWIGHT: No, Michael. 
DWIGHT: No, Michael. 
DWIGHT: No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast. 
DWIGHT: No, Mr. Jock Hipster. 
DWIGHT: No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel. 
DWIGHT: No, my groin... 
DWIGHT: No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably! 
DWIGHT: No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala. 
DWIGHT: No, no, hear me out. Five? Six? 
DWIGHT: No, no, no!  
DWIGHT: No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!" 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no! You don t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don t have diplomatic relations. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now.  
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.  
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you! 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra.   
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no... 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no.  Blah blah blah blah! 
DWIGHT: No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing. 
DWIGHT: NO, no, no. They will cost you your life. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no. You said- you said that you were- 
DWIGHT: No, no, not Michael.  Me. I'm taking his job. 
DWIGHT: No, no. Give me the steam. 
DWIGHT: No, no. No spoilers. Please. 
DWIGHT: No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words. 
DWIGHT: No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something. 
DWIGHT: No, not me. 
DWIGHT: No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster. 
DWIGHT: No, okay. 
DWIGHT: No, Pam, Just. Just,  
DWIGHT: No, Pam. 
DWIGHT: No, panic is warranted! 
DWIGHT: No, pictures are too interpretive. 
DWIGHT: No, please don't do this, monkey. 
DWIGHT: No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive. 
DWIGHT: No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three. 
DWIGHT: No, sit down. "Seasonal." Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point.  Thank you.  Oh, God. Next slide. 
DWIGHT: No, stop it! Come on! Michael. 
DWIGHT: No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt. 
DWIGHT: No, that is huge. 
DWIGHT: No, that was my Sensei. 
DWIGHT: No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body. 
DWIGHT: No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first. 
DWIGHT: No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer. 
DWIGHT: No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go! 
DWIGHT: No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael. 
DWIGHT: No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable. 
DWIGHT: No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you. 
DWIGHT: No, Toby!  Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you.  Ask him if he remembers Jim.  
DWIGHT: No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead. 
DWIGHT: No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He s my tribe. 
DWIGHT: No, try me. 
DWIGHT: No, we don't know that. The smoke could be coming through an air duct. 
DWIGHT: No, we haven t ordered anything. No one s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  
DWIGHT: No, why were you in there?! 
DWIGHT: No, you can stop. 
DWIGHT: No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up. 
DWIGHT: No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack. 
DWIGHT: No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money. 
DWIGHT: No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto. 
DWIGHT: No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now. 
DWIGHT: No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone. 
DWIGHT: No, you re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? L-- 
DWIGHT: No, you stop. 
DWIGHT: No, you ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes. 
DWIGHT: No, you will be tested. 
DWIGHT: No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long. 
DWIGHT: No, you're too close. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No.

DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DWIGHT: No.  
DWIGHT: No.   
DWIGHT: No. And the sheets are made of fire. 
DWIGHT: No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle? 
DWIGHT: No. Angela! What are you saying? 
DWIGHT: No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice. 
DWIGHT: No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months. 
DWIGHT: No. Crust first.  Okay, now the beer.  Beer me Jim.  Ssss. Gentle.  Now I've gotta go meet Angela. 
DWIGHT: No. I ll be damned if I m gonna let us lose me. 
DWIGHT: No. I think you should date Kelly. 
DWIGHT: No. I want it. I'm going to use it. 
DWIGHT: No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team. 
DWIGHT: No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything.  
DWIGHT: No. It's gonna be over before you know it. 
DWIGHT: No. Jim, come on. 
DWIGHT: No. Let him get his own. It s Syracuse money. 
DWIGHT: No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit. 
DWIGHT: No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site. 
DWIGHT: No. No. 
DWIGHT: No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!  No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO!  NOOOOOOOOO! 
DWIGHT: No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike. 
DWIGHT: No. OK, no. I'm crowning! I'm crowning! Aaaaaaaa!   
DWIGHT: No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months.  Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months? 
DWIGHT: No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep. 
DWIGHT: No. Putting a load on more like it. 
DWIGHT: No. She needs her rest again. 
DWIGHT: No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous. 
DWIGHT: No. That is not a toy. 
DWIGHT: No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex. 
DWIGHT: No. We can t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk. 
DWIGHT: No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store. 
DWIGHT: No. Wholesies.  
DWIGHT: No. Why not do it now? David 
DWIGHT: No. Why? No.   
DWIGHT: No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you. 
DWIGHT: No. You will not. Woman in 
DWIGHT: No... How skin is the largest organ of the body. 
DWIGHT: No... no. One crisis at a time. 
DWIGHT: No... way! Yeah! 
DWIGHT: No? Then you are an idiot. 
DWIGHT: None of your business then.   Good. So what weapon? 
DWIGHT: None of your business, Jim. 
DWIGHT: None of your business. 
DWIGHT: None of your business. 
DWIGHT: None of your business. 
DWIGHT: None taken. What do you got? 
DWIGHT: Nope, I wasn't bitten. 
DWIGHT: Nope. 
DWIGHT: Nope.  Fire in the hole!  Oh, yeah! Now that s what working at a paper company s all about!  
DWIGHT: Normal. Ugly. 
DWIGHT: Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know.   No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken. 
DWIGHT: Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt. 
DWIGHT: Not  significant is a big word  
DWIGHT: Not a gun.  
DWIGHT: Not a viable option. 
DWIGHT: Not a word. 
DWIGHT: Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch. 
DWIGHT: Not by a long shot! 
DWIGHT: Not coming, have plans. 
DWIGHT: Not counting the last one, 25. 
DWIGHT: Not doing that. 
DWIGHT: Not Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Not even close, Meredith. Come on! 
DWIGHT: Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client. Mr. 
DWIGHT: Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who. 
DWIGHT: Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing?  Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive. 
DWIGHT: Not good. Prince 
DWIGHT: Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk! 
DWIGHT: Not like this. 
DWIGHT: Not literally. 
DWIGHT: Not my problem. 
DWIGHT: Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by.  
DWIGHT: Not my style. 
DWIGHT: Not my urine. 
DWIGHT: Not now! 
DWIGHT: Not now! Private time! 
DWIGHT: Not now, Temp. 
DWIGHT: Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job. 
DWIGHT: Not so fast. 
DWIGHT: Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage. 
DWIGHT: Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin. 
DWIGHT: Not the living in fear, that's new. 
DWIGHT: Not what I asked. 
DWIGHT: Not yet. 
DWIGHT: Not you, Erin. 
DWIGHT: Not!  
DWIGHT: Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah! 
DWIGHT: Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon? 
DWIGHT: Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors. 
DWIGHT: Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is...  on. 
DWIGHT: Nothing! Nothing is going on. Keep moving please. 
DWIGHT: Nothing. 
DWIGHT: Nothing.  
DWIGHT: Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing. 
DWIGHT: Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down. 
DWIGHT: Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou- Ohh... it's a holster. 
DWIGHT: Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss. 
DWIGHT: Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha  Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea. 
DWIGHT: Now watch, let me take you from behind. 
DWIGHT: Now what? 
DWIGHT: Now, for the last time, I d like a side salad with balsamic. 
DWIGHT: Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form. 
DWIGHT: Now, listen,... 
DWIGHT: Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item 
DWIGHT: Now. Now. Now. 
DWIGHT: Numb me up. I want anesthesia! 
DWIGHT: Number one!! 
DWIGHT: Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say...  con-quack-ulations! 
DWIGHT: Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex. 
DWIGHT: Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision. 
DWIGHT: Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash. 
DWIGHT: Obesity-caused illnesses. 
DWIGHT: Observe.  
DWIGHT: Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I m gonna like it. 
DWIGHT: Obviously. I knew it. 
DWIGHT: Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7. 
DWIGHT: Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself. 
DWIGHT: Of course I checked it. 
DWIGHT: Of course I saw it. 
DWIGHT: Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time. 
DWIGHT: Of course there s a costume!  Oh, this is gonna be great. There s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation. 
DWIGHT: Of course you are. 
DWIGHT: Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building. 
DWIGHT: Of course you found him not guilty.  "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm." 
DWIGHT: Of course. 
DWIGHT: Of course. 
DWIGHT: Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly? 
DWIGHT: Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?   
DWIGHT: Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator. 
DWIGHT: Oh  
DWIGHT: oh  
DWIGHT: Oh  really. Suit Store 
DWIGHT: Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings. 
DWIGHT: Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist! 
DWIGHT: Oh come on. 
DWIGHT: Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please? 
DWIGHT: Oh D. 
DWIGHT: Oh gee, then why do I have an office? 
DWIGHT: Oh give me a break. 
DWIGHT: Oh God, that's a terrible idea. 
DWIGHT: Oh God. 
DWIGHT: Oh god. 
DWIGHT: Oh God... Hey no! Where do you think you re going? You ve gotta stay for the big presentation we ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He s like an even more handsome Bill Gates. 
DWIGHT: Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair? 
DWIGHT: Oh good. She broke up with you. 
DWIGHT: Oh he's not that nice. 
DWIGHT: Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here! 
DWIGHT: Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back. 
DWIGHT: Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won t be necessary tonight. 
DWIGHT: Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately. 
DWIGHT: Oh I am. In my own words. 
DWIGHT: Oh I did. I did. 
DWIGHT: Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on. Uncle 
DWIGHT: Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA. 
DWIGHT: Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it. 
DWIGHT: Oh I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage. 
DWIGHT: Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins. 
DWIGHT: Oh man!  I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails... 
DWIGHT: Oh man, 
DWIGHT: Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!!   I'll get it.   
DWIGHT: Oh my ! Oh d ! Oh, how did ?  Huhhhhh! 
DWIGHT: Oh my God, she told you? 
DWIGHT: Oh my God, we have to be there. 
DWIGHT: Oh my God. 
DWIGHT: Oh my God. 
DWIGHT: Oh my god. 
DWIGHT: Oh my god. 
DWIGHT: Oh my god. 
DWIGHT: Oh my goodness. 
DWIGHT: Oh my gosh, now she's up. 
DWIGHT: Oh my gosh. 
DWIGHT: Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it s barely three pounds. 
DWIGHT: Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh!   
DWIGHT: Oh no, I m spilling Jim all over the carpet.  
DWIGHT: Oh no, it's broken. 
DWIGHT: Oh no, no, no. 
DWIGHT: Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot. 
DWIGHT: Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour? 
DWIGHT: Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you? 
DWIGHT: Oh no...   
DWIGHT: Oh Pam. 
DWIGHT: Oh Pam. Take a chill pill. 
DWIGHT: Oh please! You're not taking any trip. 
DWIGHT: Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it  
DWIGHT: Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women. 
DWIGHT: Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth. 
DWIGHT: Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden. 
DWIGHT: Oh really? 
DWIGHT: Oh really? How are you gonna do that? 
DWIGHT: Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking? 
DWIGHT: Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks. 
DWIGHT: Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right.  
DWIGHT: Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink? 
DWIGHT: Oh that s real creative. 
DWIGHT: Oh we know. 
DWIGHT: Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted. 
DWIGHT: Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision. 
DWIGHT: Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time. 
DWIGHT: Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender. 
DWIGHT: Oh yeah? 
DWIGHT: Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're "appearance"ists! 
DWIGHT: Oh! 
DWIGHT: Oh!  
DWIGHT: Oh!  Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.  
DWIGHT: Oh! Here's a door. Check that one out. How's the handle? 
DWIGHT: Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed. 
DWIGHT: Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise? 
DWIGHT: Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that. 
DWIGHT: Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you. 
DWIGHT: Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he s been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him. 
DWIGHT: Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy! 
DWIGHT: Oh, as fire marshal I would have to. 
DWIGHT: Oh, better than OK.  You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie. 
DWIGHT: Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies. 
DWIGHT: Oh, come on. I ve never heard of such a thing. 
DWIGHT: Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys.    
DWIGHT: Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake. 
DWIGHT: Oh, dear God in heaven. 
DWIGHT: Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance. Chad 
DWIGHT: Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back. 
DWIGHT: Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did. 
DWIGHT: Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears.  See what you leave me with here, Jim? 
DWIGHT: Oh, don t lie. I m trying to save those precious knees you re always bragging about. Now, let s get out of here. He could be right behind us. 
DWIGHT: Oh, don t worry. They ll get got. 
DWIGHT: Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one. 
DWIGHT: Oh, Esther. 
DWIGHT: Oh, fire! Oh my goodness! What's the procedure? What do we do, people? 
DWIGHT: Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk. 
DWIGHT: Oh, God, that tickles. What did... 
DWIGHT: Oh, god, this again? You re Stinky. 
DWIGHT: Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson. 
DWIGHT: Oh, God. 
DWIGHT: Oh, good, and you resent this because... 
DWIGHT: Oh, great. He s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung. 
DWIGHT: Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. 
DWIGHT: Oh, he is definitely attracted to her. 
DWIGHT: Oh, hello there.  But what are you doing? 
DWIGHT: Oh, here's 
DWIGHT: Oh, he's sure. Just shoot. 
DWIGHT: Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet? 
DWIGHT: Oh, hey, I ll take a coffee. 
DWIGHT: Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review. 
DWIGHT: Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe? 
DWIGHT: Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic. 
DWIGHT: Oh, how did that happen? 
DWIGHT: Oh, huggy hugs. 
DWIGHT: Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks.  
DWIGHT: Oh, I bet you think it s all about core, huh? 
DWIGHT: Oh, I bet you will before the day is over. 
DWIGHT: Oh, I doubt you ll make it. Very few do who ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right? 
DWIGHT: Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL. 
DWIGHT: Oh, I like it. 
DWIGHT: Oh, I m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I m not in your panties, I don t go vigilantes. Why don t you ask your husband? 
DWIGHT: Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking. 
DWIGHT: Oh, I'm equipped... I can... 
DWIGHT: Oh, I'm OK. I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David. David 
DWIGHT: Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you. 
DWIGHT: Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences? Woman in 
DWIGHT: Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste? 
DWIGHT: Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush.  I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it'll work.  Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt. 
DWIGHT: Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it's so wet. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this. 
DWIGHT: Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose. 
DWIGHT: Oh, just... David 
DWIGHT: Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem.  But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie. 
DWIGHT: Oh, look at this.  Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box.  
DWIGHT: Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! 
DWIGHT: Oh, man! 
DWIGHT: Oh, man! 
DWIGHT: Oh, man! 
DWIGHT: Oh, Man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure. 
DWIGHT: Oh, man, am I a woman? 
DWIGHT: Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators? 
DWIGHT: Oh, man, never thought I d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow.  
DWIGHT: Oh, man. 
DWIGHT: Oh, man.  No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out!  
DWIGHT: Oh, man. White people, right? 
DWIGHT: Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious. 
DWIGHT: Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em.   
DWIGHT: Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you. 
DWIGHT: Oh, my God. 
DWIGHT: Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face. 
DWIGHT: Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan s costume and check out his notes. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no no no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no! 
DWIGHT: Oh, no, no, no. It s good. It s really -- on the Internet, it s a really -- that s a really good, good, thing. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no, no. That's not dorky.  Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They re not for me. They re for my cousin Mose. He s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. No. No. No. No. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. Oh, no! 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. What? 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. What's wrong? 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath! 
DWIGHT: Oh, not gonna happen. 
DWIGHT: Oh, not likely. 3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up. 
DWIGHT: Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love! 
DWIGHT: Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood.  Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers. 
DWIGHT: Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such. 
DWIGHT: Oh, okay. 
DWIGHT: Oh, our contract. 
DWIGHT: Oh, please. 
DWIGHT: Oh, please. 
DWIGHT: Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah! 
DWIGHT: Oh, really nothing? 
DWIGHT: Oh, really? Mmm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: Oh, really? What else? Let me see. 
DWIGHT: Oh, right.  The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe. 
DWIGHT: Oh, so glad I could help. 
DWIGHT: Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd.   Really?   Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti---   
DWIGHT: Oh, so you drive an X-Earth? 
DWIGHT: Oh, sure thing, go ahead. 
DWIGHT: Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok? David 
DWIGHT: Oh, Thank God. We are famished! 
DWIGHT: Oh, thank you. 
DWIGHT: Oh, thank you. 
DWIGHT: Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work? 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay.  So...you're gonna be workin' here? 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's funny. 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL! 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me? 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot! 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's my last one. 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's perfect! 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's quite a leap Pam. 
DWIGHT: Oh, they're forming an alliance 
DWIGHT: Oh, this could be a juicy one. 
DWIGHT: Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your...  
DWIGHT: Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor. 
DWIGHT: Oh, tips are expected? 
DWIGHT: Oh, ugh.  What is this, a meatball? Really?  
DWIGHT: Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her. 
DWIGHT: Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy. 
DWIGHT: Oh, we do. So we ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups. 
DWIGHT: Oh, we will. Have a seat.  
DWIGHT: Oh, well, doesn't surprise me. 
DWIGHT: Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission? 
DWIGHT: Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them? 
DWIGHT: Oh, worker's comp, my ass! 
DWIGHT: Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you.  
DWIGHT: Oh, yeah. 
DWIGHT: Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw. 
DWIGHT: Oh, yeah. Yes! Robert 
DWIGHT: Oh, yes, we do. 
DWIGHT: Oh, yes. 
DWIGHT: Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions...  willingly, or as slaves. 
DWIGHT: Oh, you get kicked. 
DWIGHT: Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces. 
DWIGHT: Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers. 
DWIGHT: Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant. 
DWIGHT: Oh, you think they re my only friends? I ve got way more friends than that, and they re all better than the losers who work here.  
DWIGHT: Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first. 
DWIGHT: Oh, you're kidding me! 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
DWIGHT: Oh.  
DWIGHT: Oh.  
DWIGHT: Oh. Fine. Isabel,  nice to see you. What do you want? 
DWIGHT: Oh. God. 
DWIGHT: Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish.   And you slap like a girl. 
DWIGHT: Oh. I got it. 
DWIGHT: Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk. 
DWIGHT: Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah! 
DWIGHT: Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest. 
DWIGHT: Oh. Meh. 
DWIGHT: Oh. Of course. 
DWIGHT: Oh. Terrible idea. 
DWIGHT: Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff. 
DWIGHT: Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs. 
DWIGHT: Oh... 
DWIGHT: Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees. 
DWIGHT: Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan. 
DWIGHT: Oh... Narcolepsy. 
DWIGHT: Oh... no... really? 
DWIGHT: Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders. 
DWIGHT: Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on! 
DWIGHT: Ohh. 
DWIGHT: Ohhhhhh! 
DWIGHT: Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this. You know maybe sign-- 
DWIGHT: Oink the pigs, that is very important.  
DWIGHT: Ok 
DWIGHT: Ok 
DWIGHT: OK 
DWIGHT: OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka. Man on 
DWIGHT: OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered. 
DWIGHT: Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it. 
DWIGHT: Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman. 
DWIGHT: Ok ok ok, wait! You win.  
DWIGHT: Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date? 
DWIGHT: OK you are useless. 
DWIGHT: OK you know what, you can be a witness.  Can you reprimand him? 
DWIGHT: OK! 
DWIGHT: OK! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy. 
DWIGHT: Ok, 25 and one girl push-up! 
DWIGHT: OK, as I was saying, right now we are having -- 
DWIGHT: Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps? 
DWIGHT: OK, can we steer away from gay people? Mr. 
DWIGHT: OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done. 
DWIGHT: OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick. 
DWIGHT: OK, everybody just calm down. 
DWIGHT: Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in. 
DWIGHT: OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do. 
DWIGHT: OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please. 
DWIGHT: Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go! 
DWIGHT: OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go.  Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie. 
DWIGHT: OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire? 
DWIGHT: Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene. 
DWIGHT: Ok, give that back to me. 
DWIGHT: Ok, good 
DWIGHT: Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it? 
DWIGHT: Ok, good. Me too, get in the car. 
DWIGHT: OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures? 
DWIGHT: Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries. 
DWIGHT: OK, I accept it. 
DWIGHT: Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished! 
DWIGHT: Ok, I am just getting started, ok? 
DWIGHT: OK, I apologize for yelling at you. 
DWIGHT: OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this. 
DWIGHT: Ok, I get it. 
DWIGHT: OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies. 
DWIGHT: OK, I take it back, it's a workspace. 
DWIGHT: Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?   
DWIGHT: Ok, I'll punch you. 
DWIGHT: OK, I'm ready. 
DWIGHT: Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing? 
DWIGHT: Ok, let him know that I'm here. 
DWIGHT: OK, listen. Everything here is up to code. 
DWIGHT: OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me. 
DWIGHT: Ok, no, they don't understand who they have... 
DWIGHT: Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him! 
DWIGHT: Ok, ok. 
DWIGHT: OK, our prices have never been lower. 
DWIGHT: Ok, Pam, thanks. 
DWIGHT: OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that. 
DWIGHT: Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do.  
DWIGHT: Ok, tell him that's not true. 
DWIGHT: OK, temp. 
DWIGHT: Ok, thanks.  There you are. What happened? 
DWIGHT: Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas. 
DWIGHT: OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all. 
DWIGHT: OK, this is stupid. 
DWIGHT: OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear? 
DWIGHT: Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the "trappings" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going... 
DWIGHT: Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait.  You two, Jersey State girls, let's go. Tall Girl 
DWIGHT: Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade? 
DWIGHT: Ok, well played. Neither of us'll write the other up for not working. 
DWIGHT: OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then. 
DWIGHT: OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine. 
DWIGHT: OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office. 
DWIGHT: OK, what am I thinking right now? 
DWIGHT: Ok, what are they? 
DWIGHT: Ok, what is going on here? 
DWIGHT: OK, what's up? 
DWIGHT: OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do. 
DWIGHT: OK, where does it hurt? 
DWIGHT: OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this.  
DWIGHT: Ok, you guys should not be doing this. 
DWIGHT: Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end. 
DWIGHT: OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy.  Come on. 
DWIGHT: OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything? 
DWIGHT: OK. 
DWIGHT: OK. 
DWIGHT: Ok. 
DWIGHT: OK. 
DWIGHT: OK. 
DWIGHT: OK.  
DWIGHT: Ok.   
DWIGHT: Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ... 
DWIGHT: Ok. First impressions? 
DWIGHT: Ok. Front Desk 
DWIGHT: OK. Good night Ryan. 
DWIGHT: Ok. Oh, god.  
DWIGHT: Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha!  That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me. 
DWIGHT: Ok. So what is the secret Michael? 
DWIGHT: Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know. 
DWIGHT: OK. That's not...  
DWIGHT: Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today. 
DWIGHT: Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: OK. Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot. God! 
DWIGHT: Ok. Who reports to who? 
DWIGHT: OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him . Let's go, c'mon. Here we go. 
DWIGHT: OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away. 
DWIGHT: OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted. 
DWIGHT: Okay--- 
DWIGHT: Okay   
DWIGHT: Okay  Seven, one, one, nine  
DWIGHT: Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar? 
DWIGHT: Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed... 
DWIGHT: Okay scram, wizard. 
DWIGHT: Okay that's- 
DWIGHT: Okay! 
DWIGHT: Okay! Come on! 
DWIGHT: Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it. 
DWIGHT: Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth? 
DWIGHT: Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership. 
DWIGHT: Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company. 
DWIGHT: Okay, and remember-you're not gay. 
DWIGHT: Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle. 
DWIGHT: Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you! 
DWIGHT: Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don t know where I d put you. 
DWIGHT: Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked. 
DWIGHT: Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you.  
DWIGHT: Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now! 
DWIGHT: Okay, everyone, listen up!  Time to begin the interview process!  Andrew Bernard. 
DWIGHT: Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela. 
DWIGHT: Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again! 
DWIGHT: Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back? 
DWIGHT: Okay, fine. Where's my wallet? 
DWIGHT: Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition. 
DWIGHT: Okay, fireable offenses 
DWIGHT: Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right? 
DWIGHT: Okay, get out of here. 
DWIGHT: Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia? 
DWIGHT: Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well? 
DWIGHT: Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he? 
DWIGHT: Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today. 
DWIGHT: Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.  
DWIGHT: Okay, here s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party. 
DWIGHT: Okay, here we go. Here we go.  Put it in.  
DWIGHT: Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me- 
DWIGHT: Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose? 
DWIGHT: Okay, hey, hey, hey... 
DWIGHT: Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place. Senator 
DWIGHT: Okay, how's that? 
DWIGHT: Okay, I can do that. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat  is the strong hand you want on the wheel. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I m a woman.  I m a woman. Good? 
DWIGHT: Okay, I m gonna need you to print it out.  
DWIGHT: Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this- 
DWIGHT: Okay, I'll drive. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going... 
DWIGHT: Okay, I'm on it! 
DWIGHT: Okay, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Okay, just shut it. 
DWIGHT: Okay, knock it off, Rolph. 
DWIGHT: Okay, let's go over the plan again. 
DWIGHT: Okay, let's go. 
DWIGHT: Okay, listen. I m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I ve never actually done this before. 
DWIGHT: Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go. 
DWIGHT: Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really.  
DWIGHT: Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go. 
DWIGHT: Okay, now here s the plan. I m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him. 
DWIGHT: Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one. 
DWIGHT: Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation. 
DWIGHT: Okay, okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay, okay.  But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right? 
DWIGHT: Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It s gonna be fine. It s gonna be fine. There s plenty of Pyramids. 
DWIGHT: Okay, okay. Shh!  
DWIGHT: Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit. Missing beets from all over the farm. No footprints. Inside job. Mose in socks. Boom, case closed. 
DWIGHT: Okay, question.  When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York? 
DWIGHT: Okay, really? 
DWIGHT: Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait-   
DWIGHT: Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we re about to do? 
DWIGHT: Okay, that is not an eight foot sub. Delivery 
DWIGHT: Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life! 
DWIGHT: Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley s got way more body fat than they do. 
DWIGHT: Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones. 
DWIGHT: Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane...  They are now off their meds. 
DWIGHT: Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever. 
DWIGHT: Okay, this isn t working for me,  cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss. 
DWIGHT: Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car. 
DWIGHT: Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing. 
DWIGHT: Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga! 
DWIGHT: Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say. 
DWIGHT: Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won t work. That s no good. 
DWIGHT: Okay, what are you still doing at your desk? 
DWIGHT: Okay, what's next? 
DWIGHT: Okay, which side of the list am I on? 
DWIGHT: Okay, who moved my desk? 
DWIGHT: Okay, why are you calling Jo? 
DWIGHT: Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that s great. 
DWIGHT: Okay, you can stop. 
DWIGHT: Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist. 
DWIGHT: Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Okay.  
DWIGHT: Okay.  
DWIGHT: Okay.  Whoo! 
DWIGHT: Okay.  You ever been in a manager s office before? 
DWIGHT: Okay.  You owe me. 
DWIGHT: Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah!  
DWIGHT: Okay. Andy & 
DWIGHT: Okay. But it s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can t scrub worth a damn. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Come on! Jim! 
DWIGHT: Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Fine. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Fine. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Good, good, good.  
DWIGHT: Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You re still at the 570 number? 
DWIGHT: Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. 
DWIGHT: Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Let's go. Step up. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Man in 
DWIGHT: Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much. Todd 
DWIGHT: Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap. 
DWIGHT: Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy? 
DWIGHT: Okay. So yeah. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on. 
DWIGHT: Okay. What'd you get? 
DWIGHT: Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog. 
DWIGHT: Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now. 
DWIGHT: Okay? 
DWIGHT: Okay? 
DWIGHT: Okay?  "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-" 
DWIGHT: Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere. 
DWIGHT: On a boat. Andy:That... 
DWIGHT: On an innocent baby. 
DWIGHT: On his mother's grave. 
DWIGHT: On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair. 
DWIGHT: On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers. 
DWIGHT: On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready? 
DWIGHT: On three. One... two... three. 
DWIGHT: On your marks, get set... 
DWIGHT: Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift. 
DWIGHT: Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed. 
DWIGHT: Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified. 
DWIGHT: Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War  
DWIGHT: One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask. 
DWIGHT: One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines? 
DWIGHT: One minute ago. 
DWIGHT: One more. To our boss! 
DWIGHT: One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered. 
DWIGHT: One of the warehouse guys. 
DWIGHT: One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that. 
DWIGHT: One of us is out of here by the end of today!  
DWIGHT: One, two, three.  
DWIGHT: One. Two. Three!  
DWIGHT: One... 
DWIGHT: Only one way to find out. 
DWIGHT: Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo!  Ohh...Too much strudel. 
DWIGHT: Ooh, I love repartee. 
DWIGHT: Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread? 
DWIGHT: Oooh! 
DWIGHT: Ooohhh...  Oh man! You okay? 
DWIGHT: Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face.  Ah. 
DWIGHT: Open the gates! There s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There s plenty for everyone! 
DWIGHT: Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane s coming. I suppose you re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark? 
DWIGHT: Opus dei. Male church 
DWIGHT: Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke. 
DWIGHT: Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do. 
DWIGHT: Or get hit by a car- 
DWIGHT: Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him. 
DWIGHT: Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts... 
DWIGHT: Or none of you  
DWIGHT: Or real bombs. 
DWIGHT: Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela? 
DWIGHT: Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up? 
DWIGHT: Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular. 
DWIGHT: Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic. Bob 
DWIGHT: Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities. 
DWIGHT: Oscar is out sick. 
DWIGHT: Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule. 
DWIGHT: Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements? 
DWIGHT: Oscar. 
DWIGHT: Oscar... 
DWIGHT: Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me. 
DWIGHT: Oui. 
DWIGHT: Our theme, if you will. 
DWIGHT: Out of loyalty to this company... 
DWIGHT: Out of the way! Move it or lose it! 
DWIGHT: Outback steakhouse.  I'm Australian, mate! 
DWIGHT: Outside of work. 
DWIGHT: Ouu! Ou! Ouu! Ouu! 
DWIGHT: Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected. 
DWIGHT: Ow. 
DWIGHT: Ow. 
DWIGHT: Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money. 
DWIGHT: P.S. We should should kill him. 
DWIGHT: Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid. Todd 
DWIGHT: Packer. 
DWIGHT: Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately. 
DWIGHT: Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass. 
DWIGHT: Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like? 
DWIGHT: Pam made me put a banana in my holster. 
DWIGHT: Pam was supposed to get 'em. 
DWIGHT: Pam wishes.  Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil... 
DWIGHT: Pam! 
DWIGHT: Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim. 
DWIGHT: Pam, hello. 
DWIGHT: Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap. 
DWIGHT: Pam, I'll help you. 
DWIGHT: Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up. 
DWIGHT: Pam, information is power. 
DWIGHT: Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks. 
DWIGHT: Pam, please call security! 
DWIGHT: Pam, steal something or pick the final gift. 
DWIGHT: Pam, this isn't a shopping trip. 
DWIGHT: Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately. 
DWIGHT: Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment. 
DWIGHT: Pam, would you care for a bagel? 
DWIGHT: Pam. 
DWIGHT: Pam. 
DWIGHT: Pam. 
DWIGHT: Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately? 
DWIGHT: Pam... 
DWIGHT: Pam? 
DWIGHT: Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on. 
DWIGHT: Paranoid? I m not familiar with the word. And I really don t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job. 
DWIGHT: Parley, my office, five minutes. 
DWIGHT: Part of my job. 
DWIGHT: Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority. 
DWIGHT: Party's over. You are so busted! 
DWIGHT: Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you.  And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight!   
DWIGHT: Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop. 
DWIGHT: Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground. 
DWIGHT: PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you. 
DWIGHT: Peepa, how is she? 
DWIGHT: People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly. 
DWIGHT: People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire. 
DWIGHT: People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it. 
DWIGHT: People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.' 
DWIGHT: People love beets. 
DWIGHT: People who don't trust egg whites. 
DWIGHT: People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1. 
DWIGHT: Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate. 
DWIGHT: Perfect casting, right? Todd 
DWIGHT: Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm. 
DWIGHT: Perhaps. 
DWIGHT: PETA. David 
DWIGHT: pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore. Camera 
DWIGHT: Pfft,  Athlead ? Please. They re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it  Stumpany,  for  Stupid Company.  
DWIGHT: Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one. 
DWIGHT: Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that... 
DWIGHT: Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning "Love," and adelph, meaning "Adolf." "the city that loves Adolf." Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.  
DWIGHT: Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It s called  Schrute or Consequences.  You re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet? 
DWIGHT: Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak. 
DWIGHT: Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable.  There you are. 
DWIGHT: Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay? 
DWIGHT: Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity. 
DWIGHT: Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody. 
DWIGHT: Phyllis. 
DWIGHT: Play it again.  He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in. 
DWIGHT: Please be seated.  
DWIGHT: Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker. 
DWIGHT: Please Ja, Ja...  
DWIGHT: Please Michael, please. 
DWIGHT: Please sir! Spare him. Please. 
DWIGHT: Please take an agenda item. 
DWIGHT: Please, come back. 
DWIGHT: Please, don't. 
DWIGHT: Please, I'll make you proud. 
DWIGHT: Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work. 
DWIGHT: Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back.  Please. 
DWIGHT: Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively! 
DWIGHT: Please, Mr. Buttlicker -- 
DWIGHT: Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em? 
DWIGHT: Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe. 
DWIGHT: Please. 
DWIGHT: Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home? 
DWIGHT: Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap. 
DWIGHT: Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes? 
DWIGHT: Please? 
DWIGHT: Please? 
DWIGHT: Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date. 
DWIGHT: Please? Please, Pam? 
DWIGHT: Pleasure. 
DWIGHT: Plus a little extra. Also, I love you. 
DWIGHT: Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm. 
DWIGHT: Plus, improves your reflexes  see, I would have caught that. 
DWIGHT: Point it towards the store, idiot! 
DWIGHT: Polluticorn wishes.  
DWIGHT: Poor hornet. 
DWIGHT: Poor little fella. 
DWIGHT: Post hole digging.  
DWIGHT: Pow! Pow! Pow! 
DWIGHT: Power. 
DWIGHT: Prestige is ours. Okay, they re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert. 
DWIGHT: Pretty good. 
DWIGHT: Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison? 
DWIGHT: Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino. 
DWIGHT: Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was. 
DWIGHT: Probably.  
DWIGHT: Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat. 
DWIGHT: Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes? 
DWIGHT: Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don t you just take estrogen?   There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you?  Mwah. 
DWIGHT: Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now. 
DWIGHT: Psh, why is that great? 
DWIGHT: Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot.  What the? 
DWIGHT: Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business. Prince 
DWIGHT: Pshh. That's a bedbug. 
DWIGHT: Psst. 
DWIGHT: Psst. Jim Jim?  Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. 
DWIGHT: Psst. We're not here.  
DWIGHT: Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you. 
DWIGHT: Pull over! 
DWIGHT: Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face. 
DWIGHT: Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  
DWIGHT: Purely carnal and that's all you need to know. 
DWIGHT: Push! 
DWIGHT: Put some ice on it. 
DWIGHT: Put your fingers here. 
DWIGHT: Question. 
DWIGHT: Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine? 
DWIGHT: Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires. 
DWIGHT: Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas? 
DWIGHT: Question. Where can I put my terrarium? 
DWIGHT: Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance? 
DWIGHT: Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York? 
DWIGHT: Question? May I investigate? 
DWIGHT: Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office. 
DWIGHT: Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy. 
DWIGHT: Quiet you. 
DWIGHT: Quiet, you. 
DWIGHT: RAHHH!!!!!!! 
DWIGHT: Ready, one bullet. And boom!  
DWIGHT: Ready? 
DWIGHT: Ready? 
DWIGHT: Ready? 
DWIGHT: Ready?  Got it? Oh shoot. Got it?  Dwight Schrute. 
DWIGHT: Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  
DWIGHT: Ready? What do you think? 
DWIGHT: Ready?! 
DWIGHT: Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat. 
DWIGHT: Really funny, Michael! 
DWIGHT: Really shove it. 
DWIGHT: Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it. 
DWIGHT: Really, that's your real name? 
DWIGHT: Really. 
DWIGHT: Really. 
DWIGHT: Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
DWIGHT: Really? Anything. 
DWIGHT: Really? 'Cause Ryan says so? 
DWIGHT: Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you. 
DWIGHT: Really? Hey, um...  Old 
DWIGHT: Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive? 
DWIGHT: Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my --   
DWIGHT: Really? Oh... Then here we are. 
DWIGHT: Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is...  The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do.  Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay. 
DWIGHT: Really? That s interesting.  Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately. 
DWIGHT: Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby. 
DWIGHT: Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl! 
DWIGHT: Really? We don't have any girls from HR. 
DWIGHT: Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like? 
DWIGHT: Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again. 
DWIGHT: Rebel Yell, Billy Idol 
DWIGHT: Recyclops destroys!  
DWIGHT: Recyclops will have his revenge. 
DWIGHT: Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns. 
DWIGHT: Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them. 
DWIGHT: Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  Bagel? 
DWIGHT: Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen? 
DWIGHT: Remain calm! I have trained for this!  Okay, exit the window!  Here we go! Look out for leeches!  Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you!  Michael! Michael! 
DWIGHT: Remember on Lost when they met the Others? 
DWIGHT: Remember what we had Larry? Larry 
DWIGHT: Remember? 
DWIGHT: Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch. 
DWIGHT: Reply it! 
DWIGHT: Retaliation. Tit for tit. 
DWIGHT: Return it! Return it now! 
DWIGHT: Rhythm and blues... 
DWIGHT: Right here. 
DWIGHT: Right now! 
DWIGHT: Right over by that fence. 
DWIGHT: Right, standard. 
DWIGHT: Right, that's good, good, pursue this. 
DWIGHT: Right. 
DWIGHT: Right. 
DWIGHT: Right. Highways or surface roads? 
DWIGHT: Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling. 
DWIGHT: Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse. 
DWIGHT: Right. Okay? Great. 
DWIGHT: Right. Which one is that? 
DWIGHT: Right... 
DWIGHT: Right? 
DWIGHT: Right? 
DWIGHT: Right? 
DWIGHT: Robert! Robert California! Robert! 
DWIGHT: Robert. 
DWIGHT: Robert's favorite 
DWIGHT: Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy. 
DWIGHT: Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he s slouching. Okay, can you sl-slouch him into the seat.  Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt.  
DWIGHT: Roll in the hay, five dollars. 
DWIGHT: Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus.  If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away.  In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done. 
DWIGHT: Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks. 
DWIGHT: Rolph, leave it alone! 
DWIGHT: Rolph, please. I am asking nicely- 
DWIGHT: Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want- 
DWIGHT: Rule 
DWIGHT: Rule 
DWIGHT: Rule 
DWIGHT: Rule 
DWIGHT: Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone? 
DWIGHT: Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair. 
DWIGHT: Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled. 
DWIGHT: Ryan, will you please tell her who I am? 
DWIGHT: Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects.  
DWIGHT: Ryan. 
DWIGHT: Ryan. Come on, man? 
DWIGHT: Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan? Cousin 
DWIGHT: Ryan? What does he know? 
DWIGHT: Sabotage. 
DWIGHT: Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ. 
DWIGHT: Salad. 
DWIGHT: Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself? 
DWIGHT: Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour! 
DWIGHT: Saleswoman has a vagina. 
DWIGHT: Same old. 
DWIGHT: Same page. Just keep moving. 
DWIGHT: Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy. 
DWIGHT: Same thing. 
DWIGHT: Same thing. 
DWIGHT: Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt.  Wait, who's Dwigt? 
DWIGHT: Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch! 
DWIGHT: Saturday. 
DWIGHT: Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson. 
DWIGHT: Say it again. David 
DWIGHT: Say it. Do it. Now. 
DWIGHT: Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it. 
DWIGHT: Say no more. 
DWIGHT: Say that? Uncanny. 
DWIGHT: Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed! 
DWIGHT: Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it.  'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.' 
DWIGHT: Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far. 
DWIGHT: Schrute. Mister Schrute. 
DWIGHT: Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here. 
DWIGHT: Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year.   What about you? 
DWIGHT: Screwed. 
DWIGHT: Screwgun. The sales call! 
DWIGHT: 'Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple? Uncle 
DWIGHT: Sea horse. 
DWIGHT: Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one-- 
DWIGHT: Search his things. Police Officer 
DWIGHT: Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon. 
DWIGHT: Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had. 
DWIGHT: Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers. 
DWIGHT: Security deposit. That's been- Mr. 
DWIGHT: See ya later, Trevor. 
DWIGHT: See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle.  Busted, Halpert! 
DWIGHT: Seedless? 
DWIGHT: Self taught. You didn't even go to college. 
DWIGHT: Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this. 
DWIGHT: Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot. 
DWIGHT: Sensei, you re not watching. 
DWIGHT: Set that down.  Present yourself. 
DWIGHT: Seven minutes.   Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. .  
DWIGHT: Seven... 
DWIGHT: Seven? Can I finish please? 
DWIGHT: Seventy-two hours. 
DWIGHT: Sex. 
DWIGHT: Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot. 
DWIGHT: Shampoo. David 
DWIGHT: She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate. 
DWIGHT: She called you D? 
DWIGHT: She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike. 
DWIGHT: She had a hysterectomy. 
DWIGHT: She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine. 
DWIGHT: She is a hazard to the other people of the office. 
DWIGHT: She loves me. 
DWIGHT: She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation. 
DWIGHT: She s got a ton of great qualities. She s young, she s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn t technically incest. 
DWIGHT: She said she was only sleeping with me. 
DWIGHT: She sent an email, so. 
DWIGHT: She should thank me. 
DWIGHT: She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam... Dwight & 
DWIGHT: She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died. 
DWIGHT: She was stoned apparently. 
DWIGHT: She's in heat. She will eat your face off! 
DWIGHT: She's not here, Jim. 
DWIGHT: She's only a cat. 
DWIGHT: She's sleeping with you? 
DWIGHT: Shh Shh. 
DWIGHT: Shh, shh, shh. 
DWIGHT: Shh. 
DWIGHT: Shh.   They might be listening to us. 
DWIGHT: Shh. Do you hear that? 
DWIGHT: Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to.  Grab his feet.  Let s go! 
DWIGHT: Shhh!  Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me! 
DWIGHT: Shhh, Pam. C mon, don t be such a right-sider. 
DWIGHT: Shhh. Don't be scared.  It works.  ...oh no. 
DWIGHT: Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean? 
DWIGHT: Shotgun weddings. 
DWIGHT: Shotgun! 
DWIGHT: Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.  
DWIGHT: Should we help 'em pick up their stuff? 
DWIGHT: Shove it through! Break it! 
DWIGHT: Shunning resumed. 
DWIGHT: SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it. 
DWIGHT: Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat! 
DWIGHT: Shut up. 
DWIGHT: Shut up. 
DWIGHT: Shut up. 
DWIGHT: Shut up. That's impossible. 
DWIGHT: Sh-what? 
DWIGHT: Sign it. 
DWIGHT: Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work. 
DWIGHT: Silence? 
DWIGHT: Silver medal. 
DWIGHT: Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  Y'all having birthday cake? 
DWIGHT: Sive drafely.  
DWIGHT: Six percent, I know my worth. 
DWIGHT: Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn t seem so macho now, does it? It s a jump rope! 
DWIGHT: Sly dog. 
DWIGHT: Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Smallville. And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise. 
DWIGHT: Smart baby. That s the most flavorful bond. 
DWIGHT: Smasher? No, where d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts. 
DWIGHT: Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum. 
DWIGHT: Smells like it. 
DWIGHT: Smells pretty bad, doesn't it? 
DWIGHT: Smile nod. Smile and nod. 
DWIGHT: Smile! 
DWIGHT: Sniffling how? 
DWIGHT: So  
DWIGHT: So am I. 
DWIGHT: So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you. 
DWIGHT: So can we come in? 
DWIGHT: So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin! 
DWIGHT: So don't. 
DWIGHT: So excited. 
DWIGHT: So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera. 
DWIGHT: So I can lower it. 
DWIGHT: So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin. 
DWIGHT: So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea  . 
DWIGHT: So I ve got your resume here, but it s not telling me everything. 
DWIGHT: So important. And then we will destroy the man himself. 
DWIGHT: So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it! 
DWIGHT: So it's true? You have access to our e-mails? 
DWIGHT: So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing. 
DWIGHT: So long Donna!  
DWIGHT: So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse? 
DWIGHT: So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate. 
DWIGHT: So sexy it becomes hostile. 
DWIGHT: So tape it down. 
DWIGHT: So the monkey does the sex thing right here!  
DWIGHT: So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex. 
DWIGHT: So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy? 
DWIGHT: So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop... 
DWIGHT: So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account? 
DWIGHT: So wait a minute, there's no drugs? Police Officer 
DWIGHT: So we know which truck to van... 
DWIGHT: So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim. 
DWIGHT: So we're choosing... 
DWIGHT: So what do we know about her? 
DWIGHT: So what do you need me to do? 
DWIGHT: So what do you want? 
DWIGHT: So what I m hearing you say is,  Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible ? 
DWIGHT: So what kind of commissions you get up there? 
DWIGHT: So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man? 
DWIGHT: So what's your crazy business pipe dream? 
DWIGHT: So who are we laughing at? 
DWIGHT: So who will be your new Number Three? 
DWIGHT: So why is this on your resume?  
DWIGHT: So you excited? 
DWIGHT: So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it.   No, no like this.   Good. 
DWIGHT: So you ll do it? 
DWIGHT: So you wanna sell me magic beans.  
DWIGHT: So you'll be reporting to me, then. 
DWIGHT: So you're taking a personal day? 
DWIGHT: So, all the numbers adding up? 
DWIGHT: So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up? 
DWIGHT: So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh? 
DWIGHT: So, how did Oscar sound when he called in? 
DWIGHT: So, I'm paying full price? 
DWIGHT: So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine. 
DWIGHT: So, let's get it going. German 
DWIGHT: So, okay. You're not a liar too are you? 
DWIGHT: So, uh...  Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales. 
DWIGHT: So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week. 
DWIGHT: So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either. 
DWIGHT: So, you-- 
DWIGHT: So, you can tell your 
DWIGHT: So, you going to transfer Jim or not? 
DWIGHT: So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed? 
DWIGHT: So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself. 
DWIGHT: So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place. 
DWIGHT: So... what else is up?  Mich- 
DWIGHT: So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here. 
DWIGHT: So? 
DWIGHT: Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right?  Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state? 
DWIGHT: Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you.  Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT! 
DWIGHT: Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it. 
DWIGHT: Some of these kernels have crowned. 
DWIGHT: Some of these people are for real. 
DWIGHT: Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is... 
DWIGHT: Some sort of virus? 
DWIGHT: Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this. 
DWIGHT: Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore. 
DWIGHT: Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go.   
DWIGHT: Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make. 
DWIGHT: Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited-- 
DWIGHT: Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town. 
DWIGHT: Sorry. 
DWIGHT: Sorry. 
DWIGHT: Sorry. 
DWIGHT: Sorry. 
DWIGHT: Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile. 
DWIGHT: Sounds fair to me, David. David 
DWIGHT: Sounds like a plan. 
DWIGHT: Sounds... fun.  
DWIGHT: Sparkles, the white one, is dead. 
DWIGHT: Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die. 
DWIGHT: Speaking of pimples, let s release the BLOGGERS! 
DWIGHT: Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective. 
DWIGHT: Speaking of which...   
DWIGHT: Spin move. 
DWIGHT: Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction.  Behold. 
DWIGHT: Spoken like a true root man. 
DWIGHT: Spot, spot, spot, spot ... 
DWIGHT: Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine. 
DWIGHT: Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR. 
DWIGHT: Standing. 
DWIGHT: Standing. 
DWIGHT: STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT! 
DWIGHT: Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call. 
DWIGHT: STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim? 
DWIGHT: Stanley! Wake up! You ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire! 
DWIGHT: Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner. 
DWIGHT: Stanley, could you come with me, please. 
DWIGHT: Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients? 
DWIGHT: Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale. 
DWIGHT: Stanley. 
DWIGHT: Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela. 
DWIGHT: Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio. 
DWIGHT: Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all. 
DWIGHT: Stay out of this, you! 
DWIGHT: Steak. Rare. 
DWIGHT: Still an important position. Still a chief. 
DWIGHT: Still. 
DWIGHT: Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They re a family owned business . Jim and I used to clean up at those. We d go in pretending to be family   brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew. 
DWIGHT: Stop acting like an idiot! 
DWIGHT: Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing. 
DWIGHT: Stop forgetting things. 
DWIGHT: Stop giggling. 
DWIGHT: Stop it! 
DWIGHT: Stop it. 
DWIGHT: Stop ordering me around, Jim! 
DWIGHT: Stop playing games with me, Crawdad. 
DWIGHT: Stop trying to figure me out.  Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made? 
DWIGHT: Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo!  Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out.  
DWIGHT: Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night? 
DWIGHT: Store only has three employees. 
DWIGHT: Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club. 
DWIGHT: Stupid! 
DWIGHT: Stupid. 
DWIGHT: Stupid. Yeah, makes us look weak. 
DWIGHT: Such a chorus girl. 
DWIGHT: Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal. 
DWIGHT: Super 8? 
DWIGHT: Sure 
DWIGHT: Sure thing. 
DWIGHT: Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle! 
DWIGHT: Sure. 
DWIGHT: Sure. 
DWIGHT: Sure. 
DWIGHT: Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy) 
DWIGHT: Sure. That'd be fine. 
DWIGHT: Surprise me. No! Pepperoni. 
DWIGHT: Surprise!  Everybody! 
DWIGHT: Surveillance, gaming- and business. 
DWIGHT: Take a bowl and pass it down. 
DWIGHT: Take a stand! 
DWIGHT: Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh 
DWIGHT: Take me to his house. 
DWIGHT: Take me to Robert. 
DWIGHT: Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself.  
DWIGHT: Talk to you later, Jan. 
DWIGHT: Tape recorder. 
DWIGHT: Taste good too. 
DWIGHT: Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam. 
DWIGHT: Tell him to stop. 
DWIGHT: Tell him, not Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Tell me where it hurts. 
DWIGHT: Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders. 
DWIGHT: Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut! 
DWIGHT: Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking? 
DWIGHT: Ten. 
DWIGHT: Terrible mistake. 
DWIGHT: Terrible! 
DWIGHT: Text went through. 
DWIGHT: Thank God. 
DWIGHT: Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. 
DWIGHT: Thank you Angela. 
DWIGHT: Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission.  
DWIGHT: Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls.   Prince 
DWIGHT: Thank you Michael. 
DWIGHT: Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity! 
DWIGHT: Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth. 
DWIGHT: Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded. 
DWIGHT: Thank you Sandra! 
DWIGHT: Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years.  So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself? 
DWIGHT: Thank you very much for that. 
DWIGHT: Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it! 
DWIGHT: Thank you very much. 
DWIGHT: Thank you very much.  Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office. 
DWIGHT: Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim? 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Andy. 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Angela. 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Angela. 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Michael. 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much. 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great.  Can I have a gun? 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son? Mr. 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Sensei. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you.  
DWIGHT: Thank you.  
DWIGHT: Thank you.  
DWIGHT: Thank you.  
DWIGHT: Thank you.  You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive.  Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting.  
DWIGHT: Thank you. Hotel 
DWIGHT: Thank you. I m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. I mean, I ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh  
DWIGHT: Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager s job? 
DWIGHT: Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you 
DWIGHT: Thanks for inviting me along. 
DWIGHT: Thanks for meeting me. 
DWIGHT: Thanks old man. 
DWIGHT: Thanks so much Earl. 
DWIGHT: Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time. 
DWIGHT: Thanks, girl. 
DWIGHT: Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion. 
DWIGHT: Thanks, Michael. 
DWIGHT: Thanks, Michael.   Wait, what is this? 
DWIGHT: Thanks. 
DWIGHT: Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You re gonna watch me right? 
DWIGHT: Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions. Jim, come here. 
DWIGHT: That- 
DWIGHT: That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine. 
DWIGHT: That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.   
DWIGHT: That doesn t sound crazy, Jim. That s the sanest thing I ve ever heard. 
DWIGHT: That doesn't make any sense. 
DWIGHT: That goes directly to the tester. 
DWIGHT: That guy Miles who quit to form his own company? 
DWIGHT: That idiot's been feeding us for a week. 
DWIGHT: That is a damnable lie. I love women. 
DWIGHT: That is a demerit. 
DWIGHT: That is all. Have a good morning. 
DWIGHT: That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please. 
DWIGHT: That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one 
DWIGHT: That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast. 
DWIGHT: That is correct. 
DWIGHT: That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present. 
DWIGHT: That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less. 
DWIGHT: That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy. 
DWIGHT: That is my idea. 
DWIGHT: That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about. 
DWIGHT: That is my stapler. 
DWIGHT: That is not a statue, that is a robot. 
DWIGHT: That is not in the contract. 
DWIGHT: That is not true. Redact it. Redact it! 
DWIGHT: That is so great about the bonus! 
DWIGHT: That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands. 
DWIGHT: That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next. 
DWIGHT: That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart. 
DWIGHT: That is true. 
DWIGHT: That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest. 
DWIGHT: That laugh is so infectious. 
DWIGHT: That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy? 
DWIGHT: That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth. 
DWIGHT: That means ye, Plop! 
DWIGHT: That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up. 
DWIGHT: That never happened. He s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught  saving treats  from the kitty litter box. Suit Store 
DWIGHT: That place doesn t exist. It s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much? 
DWIGHT: That s a bit extreme. 
DWIGHT: That s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know. 
DWIGHT: That s great. Let s do this guys. 
DWIGHT: That s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don t vibrate at all. 
DWIGHT: That s it. 
DWIGHT: That s me. 
DWIGHT: That s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time. 
DWIGHT: That s really rude. I don t tell you hurricanes suck even though it s true. 
DWIGHT: That s right Jim. 
DWIGHT: That s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride. 
DWIGHT: That s right. Will you just give us a second? 
DWIGHT: That s true. 
DWIGHT: That s very true. Get the hell outta here. 
DWIGHT: That shady grove out by Willard's pond. 
DWIGHT: That snake! 
DWIGHT: That suit is amazing. 
DWIGHT: That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him. 
DWIGHT: That was the last signature I needed. 
DWIGHT: That was the sick one, right? 
DWIGHT: That was your idea. 
DWIGHT: That would be nice wouldn't it? 
DWIGHT: That would have been really embarrassing. 
DWIGHT: That! 
DWIGHT: That... that's impossible. 
DWIGHT: That's a common swindlers trick. 
DWIGHT: That's a conflict of interest. 
DWIGHT: That's a hobby, unless it's for food. 
DWIGHT: That's a realistic time line. 
DWIGHT: That's a ridiculous question. 
DWIGHT: That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback. 
DWIGHT: That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT! Deleted Scene 1 
DWIGHT: That's a very good record. 
DWIGHT: That's an exaggeration. 
DWIGHT: That's Andy Bernard. 
DWIGHT: That's awful. What kind of restaurant. 
DWIGHT: That's bad. 
DWIGHT: That's bad. 
DWIGHT: That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy. 
DWIGHT: That's because they're easy! 
DWIGHT: That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed. 
DWIGHT: That's debatable. 
DWIGHT: That's exactly what I said. 
DWIGHT: That's fair. 
DWIGHT: That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked . 
DWIGHT: That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers... 
DWIGHT: That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done.  
DWIGHT: That's good enough for me.  
DWIGHT: That's good, let's wrap it up. 
DWIGHT: That's great. 
DWIGHT: That's great. There's a big, big future in that. 
DWIGHT: That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you. 
DWIGHT: That's how it's done. 
DWIGHT: That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male "hanging out". Call the cops! 
DWIGHT: That's impossible. 
DWIGHT: That's impossible. 
DWIGHT: That's it. 
DWIGHT: That's it? This is crap!  
DWIGHT: That's just a verb. 
DWIGHT: That's just absurd. 
DWIGHT: That's my client. 
DWIGHT: That's my stopwatch. 
DWIGHT: That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan. 
DWIGHT: That's not going to happen. 
DWIGHT: That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it. 
DWIGHT: That's not good. 
DWIGHT: That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart! 
DWIGHT: That's not how it works. 
DWIGHT: That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan. 
DWIGHT: That's not why you lost. 
DWIGHT: That's not... she's... okay. Yes. 
DWIGHT: That's on a need-to-know basis. 
DWIGHT: That's our theme. 
DWIGHT: That's preposterous. 
DWIGHT: That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim. 
DWIGHT: That's really fattening. 
DWIGHT: That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me. 
DWIGHT: That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks. 
DWIGHT: That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website. 
DWIGHT: That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll! 
DWIGHT: That's right. 
DWIGHT: That's right. It is ew. It is very ew. 
DWIGHT: That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel. 
DWIGHT: That's true. 
DWIGHT: That's unacceptable. 
DWIGHT: That's what I said. 
DWIGHT: That's what she said!   
DWIGHT: That's what she said. 
DWIGHT: That's what she said. 
DWIGHT: That's where they remove the uterus. 
DWIGHT: The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out. 
DWIGHT: The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act." And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats!" 
DWIGHT: The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone. 
DWIGHT: The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man. 
DWIGHT: The bride and groom? What are their names? Uncle 
DWIGHT: The buyer is your sister s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that s an order. 
DWIGHT: The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry. 
DWIGHT: The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party. 
DWIGHT: The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms.  Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible. 
DWIGHT: The coffee in Paraguay is colder? 
DWIGHT: The Crow. 
DWIGHT: The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So , here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision. 
DWIGHT: The democratic primaries, 
DWIGHT: The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business. 
DWIGHT: The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew? Camera 
DWIGHT: The eyes are the groin of the head. 
DWIGHT: The fire guy! The fire guy! 
DWIGHT: The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information.  Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed. 
DWIGHT: The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends.  
DWIGHT: The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster. 
DWIGHT: The gun show.  
DWIGHT: The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me. 
DWIGHT: The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise.  
DWIGHT: The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person. 
DWIGHT: The leads are in? 
DWIGHT: The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there. Pam and 
DWIGHT: The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous?   Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.  It's that easy. 
DWIGHT: The new guys called a sales meeting? 
DWIGHT: The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub. 
DWIGHT: The new IT guy. Nick. 
DWIGHT: The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people. 
DWIGHT: --the party planning committee... 
DWIGHT: The power source. 
DWIGHT: The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha. 
DWIGHT: The pressure! The pressure! 
DWIGHT: The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever. 
DWIGHT: The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff.  "Count Choculitis" 
DWIGHT: The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement. 
DWIGHT: The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies. 
DWIGHT: The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved. 
DWIGHT: The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood.  They didn't eat the children. 
DWIGHT: The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life 
DWIGHT: The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair. 
DWIGHT: The Sting. The Sting. 
DWIGHT: The target-- it s Oscar, isn t it? He and the senator are gaying each other. 
DWIGHT: The temp. 
DWIGHT: The truth. 
DWIGHT: The twirl sucks. 
DWIGHT: The waitress tripped on the cord. 
DWIGHT: The warmth will lure people inside. 
DWIGHT: The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm. 
DWIGHT: The White 
DWIGHT: The White Pages. 
DWIGHT: The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers. 
DWIGHT: The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home. 
DWIGHT: The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter... 
DWIGHT: Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing. 
DWIGHT: Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order. 
DWIGHT: Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here , it's an old sales trick. 
DWIGHT: Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl.... 
DWIGHT: Then I refuse. 
DWIGHT: Then I will. 
DWIGHT: Then I would bring an axe, no books. 
DWIGHT: Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes. 
DWIGHT: Then it was an honor to have worked with you. 
DWIGHT: Then looks like we have a deal  Son  
DWIGHT: Then make him pitch to you. 
DWIGHT: Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man s closet. 
DWIGHT: Then we meet at the Denny's... 
DWIGHT: Then we will burn Utica to the ground. 
DWIGHT: Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks! 
DWIGHT: Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you. 
DWIGHT: There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They re extraordinary. 
DWIGHT: There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful. 
DWIGHT: There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick. 
DWIGHT: There he is!  We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but  
DWIGHT: There he is! Our hero!  You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories. 
DWIGHT: There he is. 
DWIGHT: There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot. 
DWIGHT: There is a hive of bees outside the front door. We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom. 
DWIGHT: There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair. 
DWIGHT: There is no book. There's only a survival guide. 
DWIGHT: There is no way that hurt. 
DWIGHT: There is no way that that was---   
DWIGHT: There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon. 
DWIGHT: There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley... 
DWIGHT: There it is.  
DWIGHT: There must be some reasonable explanation for this. 
DWIGHT: There s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black? 
DWIGHT: There s no time to explain.  Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps. 
DWIGHT: There s plenty. Don t stampede. No need to stampede, sir. 
DWIGHT: There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died. 
DWIGHT: There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye. 
DWIGHT: There were only two options. 
DWIGHT: There were. A lot of them. 
DWIGHT: There you go! 
DWIGHT: There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on. 
DWIGHT: There you go. 
DWIGHT: There's a hose out back. 
DWIGHT: There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down... 
DWIGHT: There's a photo... 
DWIGHT: There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof? 
DWIGHT: There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down... 
DWIGHT: There's no building. This could only mean one thing. 
DWIGHT: There's no gum. There never was any gum. 
DWIGHT: There's no limit to what I think I deserve. 
DWIGHT: There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here. 
DWIGHT: There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone. 
DWIGHT: There's so much more to it than that. 
DWIGHT: There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired. 
DWIGHT: There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap. 
DWIGHT: There's too many brands. Where's Holly? 
DWIGHT: These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these--- 
DWIGHT: These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil. 
DWIGHT: These covers are totally indestructible. 
DWIGHT: These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around. 
DWIGHT: These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands. 
DWIGHT: They are either going to say yes... or no. 
DWIGHT: They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor  
DWIGHT: They are now. 
DWIGHT: They are unrelated. 
DWIGHT: They could do better. 
DWIGHT: They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face. 
DWIGHT: They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission. 
DWIGHT: They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by. 
DWIGHT: They have some great kitchen ideas. 
DWIGHT: They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so... 
DWIGHT: They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out. 
DWIGHT: They match the carpet 
DWIGHT: They might be listening to us 
DWIGHT: They really do that. 
DWIGHT: They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours. 
DWIGHT: They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy! 
DWIGHT: They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion. 
DWIGHT: They seem awfully chummy, don't you think? 
DWIGHT: They should not be in that room. 
DWIGHT: They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere. 
DWIGHT: They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade. 
DWIGHT: They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day. 
DWIGHT: They're all good. So good! Number 
DWIGHT: They're not abandoning the party.  
DWIGHT: They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen.  God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I? 
DWIGHT: They're still good for another week. 
DWIGHT: They're testing it now. 
DWIGHT: They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures. 
DWIGHT: things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have. 
DWIGHT: Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can... 
DWIGHT: Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager. 
DWIGHT: Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond   
DWIGHT: Think it through. 
DWIGHT: Think! 
DWIGHT: Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight!  
DWIGHT: Thirty-two meatballs. 
DWIGHT: This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want. 
DWIGHT: This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core.  Sorry. 
DWIGHT: This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing. 
DWIGHT: This conversation has two items on the agenda. 
DWIGHT: This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize. 
DWIGHT: This expresses how loudly I love you. 
DWIGHT: This has to do-- 
DWIGHT: This interview is over. I'll let you know. 
DWIGHT: This is a bus transfer. 
DWIGHT: This is a farce. I should be teaching this course. 
DWIGHT: This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission. 
DWIGHT: This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It s not for any disorder of the body.  It s for a disorder of the mind. 
DWIGHT: This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it.  Idiots. 
DWIGHT: This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops? 
DWIGHT: This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes! 
DWIGHT: This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces. 
DWIGHT: This is called leveraging an offer.  Michael, can I talk to you for a moment? 
DWIGHT: This is disgusting, what is it this, instant? Prince 
DWIGHT: This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter. 
DWIGHT: This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this? 
DWIGHT: This is exciting! You re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings. 
DWIGHT: This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything. 
DWIGHT: This is gonna be good.  To whom it may concern.  Good, real personal. Thanks Michael.  The dictionary defines superlative 
DWIGHT: This is how business... 
DWIGHT: This is how I breathe. 
DWIGHT: This is humongous. I am not a security threat... 
DWIGHT: This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here s something. Who would eat who in an  Alive  situation. No... that can t be it. 
DWIGHT: This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer. 
DWIGHT: This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked. 
DWIGHT: This is not a test! Can you leave?! 
DWIGHT: This is not a test! Move to the exits! 
DWIGHT: This is not at drill! 
DWIGHT: This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional. 
DWIGHT: This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here? 
DWIGHT: This is not Mega-Desk. 
DWIGHT: This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour. 
DWIGHT: This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?! 
DWIGHT: This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say!  I dare you to produce one credible source about this. 
DWIGHT: This is smaller than your old place. 
DWIGHT: This is so awesome. 
DWIGHT: This is stupid! Cut. 
DWIGHT: This is the lake! 
DWIGHT: This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009. 
DWIGHT: This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room. 
DWIGHT: This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter? 
DWIGHT: This is war and that is what happens. 
DWIGHT: This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills. 
DWIGHT: This is where I saw that deer last week. 
DWIGHT: This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such. 
DWIGHT: This isn t gonna work out. 
DWIGHT: This meeting is for Knights of the Night only. 
DWIGHT: This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin. 
DWIGHT: This party is going to be awesome. 
DWIGHT: This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas! 
DWIGHT: This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet .the Pyramid.  
DWIGHT: This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow! 
DWIGHT: This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween. 
DWIGHT: This. Ends. Now. 
DWIGHT: This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking. 
DWIGHT: Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car. 
DWIGHT: Those are fighting words. 
DWIGHT: Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information -- 
DWIGHT: Those who can't farm, farm celery. 
DWIGHT: Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you Phyllis? 
DWIGHT: Three demerits and you'll receive a citation. 
DWIGHT: Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines. 
DWIGHT: Three to four hours. 
DWIGHT: Three. 
DWIGHT: Three... 
DWIGHT: Time for me to find out. 
DWIGHT: Time thief. Time thief! Fire him! 
DWIGHT: Tired...  
DWIGHT: TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW! 
DWIGHT: To be burned! 
DWIGHT: To do something about- 
DWIGHT: To give you this . 
DWIGHT: To intimidate my subordinates. 
DWIGHT: To keep secrets from my computer. 
DWIGHT: To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom. 
DWIGHT: To socialize. And inform. 
DWIGHT: --to use sudden violence. 
DWIGHT: Toby, come on.  
DWIGHT: Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here s your cake.  Bye, bye Toby. 
DWIGHT: Toby. 
DWIGHT: Toby... 
DWIGHT: Toby... 
DWIGHT: Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices. 
DWIGHT: Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing   bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You re gonna love  em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this? 
DWIGHT: Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late. 
DWIGHT: Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR  and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine. 
DWIGHT: Tokyo? 
DWIGHT: Told you. 
DWIGHT: Tom? 
DWIGHT: Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right? 
DWIGHT: Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse. 
DWIGHT: Tonight. 
DWIGHT: Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss. 
DWIGHT: Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at? 
DWIGHT: Tootenbacher. 
DWIGHT: Torture. 
DWIGHT: Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre... 
DWIGHT: Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?  
DWIGHT: Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here. 
DWIGHT: Trees! And where do trees grow? 
DWIGHT: Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see. 
DWIGHT: True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .. 
DWIGHT: True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name. 
DWIGHT: Trust me, Stanley, you're going to want to read this memo very carefully. 
DWIGHT: Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z". 
DWIGHT: Try again  Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one  is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay? 
DWIGHT: Try influenza. 
DWIGHT: Try me. 
DWIGHT: Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero. 
DWIGHT: Turn it around. Turn it around. 
DWIGHT: Turn the trash  It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress. 
DWIGHT: Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending. 
DWIGHT: Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible.   
DWIGHT: Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot.  Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes.  
DWIGHT: Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ... 
DWIGHT: Two forms of ID, please. 
DWIGHT: Two more. 
DWIGHT: Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen. 
DWIGHT: Two to three hours... 
DWIGHT: Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike. 
DWIGHT: Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in. World War II. 
DWIGHT: Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis. 
DWIGHT: Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone.  Done. 
DWIGHT: Ugh, alright.  Let's move! ... What? 
DWIGHT: Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid. 
DWIGHT: Ugh. 
DWIGHT: Ugh. I'm hanging up. 
DWIGHT: Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday. 
DWIGHT: Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy. 
DWIGHT: Uh huh. 
DWIGHT: Uh huh. 
DWIGHT: Uh huh. 
DWIGHT: Uh huh.  I'm not gonna call her. 
DWIGHT: Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack? 
DWIGHT: Uh, 24. 37. 
DWIGHT: Uh, better ask Jim. 
DWIGHT: Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup. 
DWIGHT: Uh, bumper's sagging. 
DWIGHT: Uh, can we move this to the end of the day? 
DWIGHT: Uh, duh. 
DWIGHT: Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever. 
DWIGHT: Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going? 
DWIGHT: Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould. 
DWIGHT: Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me. 
DWIGHT: Uh, it's not totally empty. 
DWIGHT: Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office. 
DWIGHT: Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection. 
DWIGHT: Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons. 
DWIGHT: Uh, no way. I am not giving up. 
DWIGHT: Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap. 
DWIGHT: Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports.  
DWIGHT: Uh, Oh. 
DWIGHT: Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name. 
DWIGHT: Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby. 
DWIGHT: Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony. 
DWIGHT: Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you? 
DWIGHT: Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on  back... order...  Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here! 
DWIGHT: Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify? 
DWIGHT: Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please. 
DWIGHT: Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha- 
DWIGHT: Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise? 
DWIGHT: Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with...  
DWIGHT: Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first. 
DWIGHT: Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT: Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team. 
DWIGHT: Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now. 
DWIGHT: Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me. 
DWIGHT: Uh.  
DWIGHT: Uh... hello!  
DWIGHT: Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand. 
DWIGHT: Uhh. 
DWIGHT: Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo...  It's me. I'm Dwight. 
DWIGHT: uhhhh....no one. 
DWIGHT: Uhh-mmm  
DWIGHT: Uh-huh, okay... Hotel 
DWIGHT: Uh-huh. 
DWIGHT: Uh-huh. 
DWIGHT: Uh-huh. 
DWIGHT: Uh-huh. 
DWIGHT: Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania?  'Cause of the euro. 
DWIGHT: Uh-huh. Younger 
DWIGHT: Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute. 
DWIGHT: Um, what about you? Younger 
DWIGHT: Um. 
DWIGHT: Um. 
DWIGHT: Um...  Oh, Ryan, you re so smart. You re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee. 
DWIGHT: Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan. 
DWIGHT: Uncanny. Put a pin in that.  Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him.  This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know? 
DWIGHT: Undistributable. 
DWIGHT: Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice. 
DWIGHT: Universal donor.  
DWIGHT: Unless we're unplugged. 
DWIGHT: Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment. 
DWIGHT: Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die! 
DWIGHT: Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun. 
DWIGHT: Up here.  
DWIGHT: Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract? Suit Store 
DWIGHT: Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making. 
DWIGHT: Use your talons! Pry 'em open!  
DWIGHT: Usually means there's a battle scene coming. 
DWIGHT: Vagina and- 
DWIGHT: Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen. 
DWIGHT: Vamping. 
DWIGHT: Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer. 
DWIGHT: Vegetarian? 
DWIGHT: Very close. 
DWIGHT: Very excited? 
DWIGHT: Very funny Jim. 
DWIGHT: Very funny, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Very funny, Michael! 
DWIGHT: Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck. 
DWIGHT: Very good. 
DWIGHT: Very good. 
DWIGHT: Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks. 
DWIGHT: Very impish.  
DWIGHT: Very smart. 
DWIGHT: Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  Oh. 
DWIGHT: Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter. 
DWIGHT: Very well, we will come back at 5:15. 
DWIGHT: Very well. 
DWIGHT: Very well. 
DWIGHT: Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize.  Detonator. Detonator where? Michael! 
DWIGHT: Vietnam sounds. 
DWIGHT: Visual aids. 
DWIGHT: Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself. 
DWIGHT: Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts. 
DWIGHT: Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds-  This is Dwight Shrute. 
DWIGHT: Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming. 
DWIGHT: Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales. 
DWIGHT: Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass. 
DWIGHT: Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class! 
DWIGHT: Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow. 
DWIGHT: Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale. 
DWIGHT: Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours. 
DWIGHT: Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no  Freak, I need a favor. 
DWIGHT: Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there. 
DWIGHT: Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator. 
DWIGHT: Wait, canine AIDS? 
DWIGHT: Wait, I got it! Confirmation 
DWIGHT: Wait, I see you every day. Can I say "Good month?" 
DWIGHT: Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes. 
DWIGHT: Wait, it s not D.M Utica, is it? Mr. 
DWIGHT: Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that...  My resolution is... meet a loose woman. 
DWIGHT: Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other s minds. You re trying to give your wife this job. 
DWIGHT: Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could ve choked so many people by now. 
DWIGHT: Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him? Police Officer 
DWIGHT: Wait, sales what sales meeting? 
DWIGHT: Wait, shut up. 
DWIGHT: Wait, so you re the boss? Suit Store 
DWIGHT: Wait, stop writing that. That is not true. 
DWIGHT: Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan. 
DWIGHT: Wait, the numbers! 
DWIGHT: Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight... 
DWIGHT: Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed. 
DWIGHT: Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this? 
DWIGHT: Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I m sure he d give a reference. 
DWIGHT: Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present? 
DWIGHT: Wait, wait, wait. 
DWIGHT: Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?  
DWIGHT: Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse? 
DWIGHT: Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH!  
DWIGHT: Wait, what girlfriend? 
DWIGHT: Wait, what Holly said? 
DWIGHT: Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go. 
DWIGHT: Wait, what? 
DWIGHT: Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making. 
DWIGHT: Wait, what? You can't take what? 
DWIGHT: Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn t on the itinerary. 
DWIGHT: Wait, why do you need three suitcases? 
DWIGHT: Wait.  He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me? 
DWIGHT: Wait. Are you saying... 
DWIGHT: Wait. I don't think yours will fit me. 
DWIGHT: Wait. Less matching to appear more rich? 
DWIGHT: Wake up!  
DWIGHT: Walk out of the house... David 
DWIGHT: Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning? 
DWIGHT: Walkie-talkies. 
DWIGHT: Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim s desk while he s away in Philly. Finally I ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It s like,  Really, Jim? You don t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.  Wow. 
DWIGHT: Want to take a rake... . 
DWIGHT: Warehouse guy. Doesn't count. 
DWIGHT: Warf. 
DWIGHT: Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off. 
DWIGHT: Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So  
DWIGHT: Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar. 
DWIGHT: Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp? 
DWIGHT: Was she talkin' back? 
DWIGHT: Was that your per diem? 
DWIGHT: Wash your hands, Kevin. 
DWIGHT: Washington Monument. 
DWIGHT: Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't. 
DWIGHT: Waste of a good hatchet. 
DWIGHT: Waste of time. 
DWIGHT: Waste of time. 
DWIGHT: Watch and learn. 
DWIGHT: Watch this part, okay? David 
DWIGHT: Watch this. 
DWIGHT: Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired. 
DWIGHT: Watch your step. 
DWIGHT: Watching? 
DWIGHT: Way to go. 
DWIGHT: We all have a hero in our heart. Mr. 
DWIGHT: We are going to have two men's rooms. 
DWIGHT: WE ARE WARRIORS! 
DWIGHT: We better. 
DWIGHT: We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right? 
DWIGHT: We can get some chicken fights going in the pool. 
DWIGHT: We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us. 
DWIGHT: We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success. 
DWIGHT: We could do it in the warehouse. 
DWIGHT: We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they re out of the house. 
DWIGHT: We did it! Michael and 
DWIGHT: We did it! We did it! 
DWIGHT: We did it, we did it. I love you. 
DWIGHT: We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world. 
DWIGHT: We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions. 
DWIGHT: We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot.  
DWIGHT: We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks? 
DWIGHT: We got a live one! On fire!!   
DWIGHT: We gotta find it before it eggs.  
DWIGHT: We gotta see what he's got. 
DWIGHT: We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you.  
DWIGHT: We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash. 
DWIGHT: We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room.  
DWIGHT: We have better service than they do! 
DWIGHT: We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault. 
DWIGHT: We have more houses to visit. 
DWIGHT: We have our confession. I'm calling security.   
DWIGHT: We have three rooms, each with a different theme. 
DWIGHT: We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is. Old 
DWIGHT: We have... a bat... in the office. 
DWIGHT: We heard it was called red-vining. 
DWIGHT: We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it. 
DWIGHT: We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him.  Nate. Your mother is dying.  
DWIGHT: We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared. 
DWIGHT: We measured it once... 
DWIGHT: We need to talk! 
DWIGHT: We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration? 
DWIGHT: We owe Andy that much. Am I right people? 
DWIGHT: We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness. 
DWIGHT: We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart. 
DWIGHT: We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room? 
DWIGHT: We thought that she was you. 
DWIGHT: We wait.  Come to papa. 
DWIGHT: We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots. 
DWIGHT: We will be called Gryffindor. 
DWIGHT: We will come back at... how is   4:45? 
DWIGHT: Weird. 
DWIGHT: Welcome aboard. 
DWIGHT: Welcome to the club, pig!  
DWIGHT: Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.  
DWIGHT: Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers. 
DWIGHT: Welcome. 
DWIGHT: Welcome. 
DWIGHT: Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton? 
DWIGHT: Well   
DWIGHT: Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So... 
DWIGHT: We'll be here waiting for you. 
DWIGHT: We'll be right beside you. 
DWIGHT: We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine. 
DWIGHT: Well don't look so surprised. 
DWIGHT: We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is... 
DWIGHT: Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend? 
DWIGHT: Well I don't have all the pieces yet. 
DWIGHT: Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control. 
DWIGHT: Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87. 
DWIGHT: Well I will prove you wrong. 
DWIGHT: Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying. 
DWIGHT: Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine. 
DWIGHT: Well I'm not responsible for that! 
DWIGHT: Well it's weevil season but we were prepared. 
DWIGHT: Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness. 
DWIGHT: Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened. 
DWIGHT: Well no, no n  
DWIGHT: Well rested. 
DWIGHT: We'll see. 
DWIGHT: We'll see. 
DWIGHT: Well something's come up, I have to go. 
DWIGHT: Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate. 
DWIGHT: Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought--- 
DWIGHT: Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy. 
DWIGHT: Well there's a lot of seats in the annex. 
DWIGHT: Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here.  
DWIGHT: Well today s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look? 
DWIGHT: Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on. 
DWIGHT: Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead. 
DWIGHT: Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat. 
DWIGHT: Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go. 
DWIGHT: Well,  No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy? 
DWIGHT: Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us? 
DWIGHT: Well, don't look, freak! 
DWIGHT: Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today. 
DWIGHT: Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable. 
DWIGHT: Well, here are your 
DWIGHT: Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so... 
DWIGHT: Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead. 
DWIGHT: Well, I did it too. 
DWIGHT: Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could ve met in the lobby. It s time to go out on a sale! Here we go. 
DWIGHT: Well, I don't have a lot of choices. 
DWIGHT: Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even... 
DWIGHT: Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die. 
DWIGHT: Well, I ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters. 
DWIGHT: Well, I m the one offering the job. 
DWIGHT: Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it. 
DWIGHT: Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work.  
DWIGHT: Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name. 
DWIGHT: Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens. 
DWIGHT: Well, I'm not done yet. 
DWIGHT: Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace. 
DWIGHT: Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then. 
DWIGHT: Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position. 
DWIGHT: Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy? 
DWIGHT: Well, it doesn't... 
DWIGHT: Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome.  
DWIGHT: Well, it s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman. 
DWIGHT: Well, it should be. 
DWIGHT: Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad. 
DWIGHT: Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right? 
DWIGHT: Well, Jerry, the one who got away. May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company? Really? Please hold.   Charles. 
DWIGHT: Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body. 
DWIGHT: Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But... bye, bye. I win. 
DWIGHT: Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic. 
DWIGHT: Well, saddles     sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth. 
DWIGHT: Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on.   
DWIGHT: Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies. 
DWIGHT: Well, the alert was already set to  Red  because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to  Double Red ? 
DWIGHT: Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents. 
DWIGHT: Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies. 
DWIGHT: Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials?   
DWIGHT: Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office. 
DWIGHT: Well, they can t all be winners. But Trevor s next and he s a real professional. You say,  Jump,  and he says,  Oh who?  He loves to jump on people, that Trevor. 
DWIGHT: Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday. 
DWIGHT: Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don t see them so I think we re good. 
DWIGHT: Well, this is it. 
DWIGHT: Well, uh, another option.   
DWIGHT: Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women. 
DWIGHT: Well, we had the Scranton White Pages. 
DWIGHT: Well, we re both just kinda learning as we go, aren t we? 
DWIGHT: Well, well, well, it s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring. 
DWIGHT: Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he  what? Michael! 
DWIGHT: Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford. 
DWIGHT: Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela. 
DWIGHT: Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me. 
DWIGHT: Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane. 
DWIGHT: Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested. 
DWIGHT: Well, yeah. 
DWIGHT: Well, you can kinda tell from the voice. 
DWIGHT: Well, you have... 
DWIGHT: Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week. 
DWIGHT: Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms. 
DWIGHT: Well... 
DWIGHT: Well... 
DWIGHT: Well... 
DWIGHT: Well... Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will. 
DWIGHT: Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely.   It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry? 
DWIGHT: Well... it's my own fault. 
DWIGHT: Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know... 
DWIGHT: Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately. 
DWIGHT: We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world. 
DWIGHT: We're gonna bust this guy. 
DWIGHT: We're gonna miss you, Gabe.  
DWIGHT: We're here.  
DWIGHT: We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone. 
DWIGHT: We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team. 
DWIGHT: We're not allowed to use the baler. 
DWIGHT: Were you absent? 
DWIGHT: Were you forced to do drugs at this concert? 
DWIGHT: We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah!  Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you! 
DWIGHT: Wh-- 
DWIGHT: Wh- I don't need $6 to help a friend. 
DWIGHT: Wha   what is this supposed to be? 
DWIGHT: Wha Yes. Your attention. Uh because  No that is all.

DWIGHT: What a surprise! Minorities sticking together. 
DWIGHT: What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?! 
DWIGHT: What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel. 
DWIGHT: What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood? 
DWIGHT: What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine! 
DWIGHT: What about Shoe La La? 
DWIGHT: What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?

DWIGHT: What are you writing about me? Receptionitis15  : What -- today? 
DWIGHT: What belt are they? 
DWIGHT: What box?! 
DWIGHT: What branch? David 
DWIGHT: What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage. 
DWIGHT: What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people. 
DWIGHT: What did I say!? 
DWIGHT: What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me.   
DWIGHT: What did they do to you, Angela? 
DWIGHT: What did you--- 
DWIGHT: What did you do? 
DWIGHT: What did you do? Huh?

DWIGHT: What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm? 
DWIGHT: What did you say? Pizza 
DWIGHT: What do you grow in here, bullcrap?  
DWIGHT: What do you have in mind?

DWIGHT: What do you think? 
DWIGHT: What do you think? You've got an hour. 
DWIGHT: What do you want!?! 
DWIGHT: What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse. 
DWIGHT: What does it look like? 
DWIGHT: What does it say? 
DWIGHT: What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news thing. 
DWIGHT: What else does it look like? 
DWIGHT: What for? We haven t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato?  Do you have those? Those aren t deep fried, right? 
DWIGHT: What happened? 
DWIGHT: What happens in accounting, stays in accounting. 
DWIGHT: What he said was...   
DWIGHT: What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you. Mr. 
DWIGHT: What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool. 
DWIGHT: What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy. 
DWIGHT: What if he's a murderer? 
DWIGHT: What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very..." 
DWIGHT: What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure. I'll hold. 
DWIGHT: What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless? 
DWIGHT: What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management. 
DWIGHT: What is going on? 
DWIGHT: What is it? 
DWIGHT: What is it? 
DWIGHT: What is it? I have vengeance to exact. 
DWIGHT: What is it? Who wrote it? 
DWIGHT: What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets

Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and...  getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again?  That's a great question.  I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.

DWIGHT: When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in. 
DWIGHT: When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -

DWIGHT: When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out. 
DWIGHT: When is the guest of honor coming? 
DWIGHT: When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.

DWIGHT: Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over! 
DWIGHT: Why is she marrying Andy? 
DWIGHT: Why Jim? 
DWIGHT: Why just Michael? 
DWIGHT: Why not call... 
DWIGHT: Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones. 
DWIGHT: Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams? 
DWIGHT: Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction. 
DWIGHT: Why would I put a banana in my holster? 
DWIGHT: Why would they all be...? Ok, see you later, Pan. 
DWIGHT: Why? 
DWIGHT: Why? 
DWIGHT: Why? I don't understand. 
DWIGHT: Why's he talking to Holly? 
DWIGHT: Will end completely! 
DWIGHT: Will never be her name. 
DWIGHT: Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it? 
DWIGHT: Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending. 
DWIGHT: Wing. 
DWIGHT: Winners! 
DWIGHT: With all my heart. 
DWIGHT: With my leads and stuff like that? 
DWIGHT: With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. 
DWIGHT: With the crotch. 
DWIGHT: With this move, he can't get you. 
DWIGHT: With today s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were. 
DWIGHT: Woah, woah, woah, Pam! 
DWIGHT: Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it. 
DWIGHT: Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you re ever in the area, you ll always have a place to stay in my barn. 
DWIGHT: Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of  em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof. 
DWIGHT: Wolves. 
DWIGHT: Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving. 
DWIGHT: Women look like white slaves. 
DWIGHT: Woo! 
DWIGHT: Woo!  Ahh!! 
DWIGHT: Woo! Okay! 
DWIGHT: Woohoo! Yes! 
DWIGHT: Woo-hoo. 
DWIGHT: Word. 
DWIGHT: Word. 
DWIGHT: Words will never be enough. 
DWIGHT: Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most. 
DWIGHT: Would that be such a bad thing? 
DWIGHT: Would that make you happy? 
DWIGHT: Would you like the stink sack? 
DWIGHT: Wow-- 
DWIGHT: Wow! 
DWIGHT: Wow! Lot of calories. 
DWIGHT: Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose. 
DWIGHT: Wow! Younger 
DWIGHT: Wow, that s great. That s great. Ok, good, let s talk about that, ok? 
DWIGHT: Wow, the honor. God, I envy them. 
DWIGHT: Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies. 
DWIGHT: Wow. 
DWIGHT: Wow. 
DWIGHT: Wow. 
DWIGHT: Wow. 
DWIGHT: Wow. Did your baby draw that? 
DWIGHT: Wow. Late every day this week. 
DWIGHT: Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, 
DWIGHT: Wow. So much crap. It s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them? 
DWIGHT: Wow. You should be the motivational speaker. 
DWIGHT: Wrestle him to the ground. 
DWIGHT: Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table? 
DWIGHT: Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest. 
DWIGHT: Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide? 
DWIGHT: Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative? 
DWIGHT: Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose. 
DWIGHT: Xterra's not even a real word. 
DWIGHT: Y el accento, donde are you from? 
DWIGHT: Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible. 
DWIGHT: Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa! 
DWIGHT: Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas. 
DWIGHT: Yaoo yay!  
DWIGHT: Yeah  
DWIGHT: Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back? 
DWIGHT: Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like "Gas ain't free!" 
DWIGHT: Yeah I m serious. 
DWIGHT: Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop. 
DWIGHT: Yeah Jim. 
DWIGHT: Yeah- oh! 
DWIGHT: Yeah pretty much. 
DWIGHT: Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot. 
DWIGHT: Yeah sure, Jim could go see her. 
DWIGHT: Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing. 
DWIGHT: Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting. 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: YEAH! 
DWIGHT: YEAH! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah!  
DWIGHT: Yeah!  Parkour! Parkour! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! Okay.  Hey David, I m back. 
DWIGHT: Yeah! Woo-hoo! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! Yeah!  
DWIGHT: Yeah! You want shirts on hangers? 
DWIGHT: Yeah! Your idea. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, and we re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, Andy. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I m doin  great. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost?   Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that!   
DWIGHT: Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, but no nipples. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, but no one here has it. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm- 
DWIGHT: Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, come on, it will be so badass. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only  
DWIGHT: Yeah, deal with it Pam! 
DWIGHT: Yeah, do tell. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I d be happy to see Jim as manager. David 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about?   You look great. I can definitely see the difference. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature! 
DWIGHT: Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law.   What did you do? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding! 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone.  Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, let's go. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, maybe I ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it s the most pleasant I ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, Meredith. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid.   Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a... 
DWIGHT: Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here.  
DWIGHT: Yeah, perfectly mediocre. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, right. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now! 
DWIGHT: Yeah, right. I m afraid that ship has sailed. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, so I don't have to worry? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, that'll work. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, trust me. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, we ll see about that. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, well look...  What about me? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.  Ok let's do it. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yeah, you don t want Italian. You ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you ll be doing life in Rikers Island. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, you said "In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize." Isn't that what you said? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, you said... 
DWIGHT: Yeah, you want to play you little hick?  
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah.  Cover me! 
DWIGHT: Yeah.  Oh. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes. Check-in 
DWIGHT: Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. It's practical. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. Senator 
DWIGHT: Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it.  
DWIGHT: Yeah. What? 
DWIGHT: Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone!  Alright, Dwight out! 
DWIGHT: Yeah... 
DWIGHT: Yeah... 
DWIGHT: Yeah... 
DWIGHT: Yeah....baby. 
DWIGHT: Yeah? 
DWIGHT: Yeah? 
DWIGHT: Yeah? Like what? 
DWIGHT: Yep, he's lying. 
DWIGHT: Yep. 
DWIGHT: Yep. 
DWIGHT: Yep. 
DWIGHT: Yep. 
DWIGHT: Yep. He'll be fine. 
DWIGHT: Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk. 
DWIGHT: Yes I did. 
DWIGHT: Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients. 
DWIGHT: Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually. 
DWIGHT: Yes I shouted "fire!". I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded-- 
DWIGHT: Yes ma'am. 
DWIGHT: Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That s right. You re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian. 
DWIGHT: Yes you can. 
DWIGHT: Yes you did. 
DWIGHT: Yes you will. 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Yes!  
DWIGHT: Yes!  Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Yes! Andy, get out here. 
DWIGHT: Yes! As your representative? 
DWIGHT: Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach. 
DWIGHT: Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius! 
DWIGHT: Yes! Ha! 
DWIGHT: YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on. 
DWIGHT: Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is "me." Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you! 
DWIGHT: Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias. 
DWIGHT: Yes! We advance to the next round! 
DWIGHT: Yes! We did it!  
DWIGHT: Yes! Yeah!  Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle!  Yeah! Whoo-Hoo! 
DWIGHT: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yes! You are entering the "No Spin Zone!" 
DWIGHT: Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly? 
DWIGHT: Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom. 
DWIGHT: Yes, exactly! 
DWIGHT: Yes, exactly. Riddle number 
DWIGHT: Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me. 
DWIGHT: Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do. 
DWIGHT: Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone. 
DWIGHT: Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good. 
DWIGHT: Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna. 
DWIGHT: Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai. 
DWIGHT: Yes, I was quilled. 
DWIGHT: Yes, it is! I am here for my bride! 
DWIGHT: Yes, it is. Carry on. 
DWIGHT: Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death. 
DWIGHT: Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell. 
DWIGHT: Yes, maybe I'm not.   
DWIGHT: Yes, Michael. 
DWIGHT: Yes, Monkey. 
DWIGHT: Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good. 
DWIGHT: Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks. 
DWIGHT: Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift. 
DWIGHT: Yes, of course it does. 
DWIGHT: Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage. 
DWIGHT: Yes, please. 
DWIGHT: Yes, Sensei! 
DWIGHT: Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I ll be right back. 
DWIGHT: Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed. 
DWIGHT: Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens. 
DWIGHT: Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die... 
DWIGHT: Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!  
DWIGHT: Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says  I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt  unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-,  oh. What was that? 
DWIGHT: Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot.  Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil. 
DWIGHT: Yes, yes I am.  
DWIGHT: Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you. 
DWIGHT: Yes, you did. 
DWIGHT: Yes, you do. 
DWIGHT: Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money? 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes.  
DWIGHT: Yes. And my decision in final. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Anything. 
DWIGHT: Yes. But this  seems to be... 
DWIGHT: Yes. Crazy. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Did you hear that, Michael? 
DWIGHT: Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Fast food. I ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day. 
DWIGHT: Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy. 
DWIGHT: Yes. I am. 
DWIGHT: Yes. I can do it. I'm your man. 
DWIGHT: Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything. 
DWIGHT: Yes. I would welcome it. 
DWIGHT: Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Of course. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Thank you. Amazed. 
DWIGHT: Yes. There he is, the birthday boy! 
DWIGHT: Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Yes. 
DWIGHT: Yes...  I miss you. 
DWIGHT: Yes..? 
DWIGHT: Yes? 
DWIGHT: Yes? 
DWIGHT: Yes?  Wha- Jim. 
DWIGHT: Yes? What is the meaning of this? Michael 
DWIGHT: Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter? 
DWIGHT: Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day. 
DWIGHT: Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean.  Practically made of plastic. 
DWIGHT: Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work . 
DWIGHT: Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office. 
DWIGHT: Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty. 
DWIGHT: Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty. 
DWIGHT: You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick. 
DWIGHT: You already said deal. 
DWIGHT: You and me, Michael. Yes! 
DWIGHT: You apologize right now. 
DWIGHT: You apologize to me right now. 
DWIGHT: You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure. 
DWIGHT: You are an impressive specimen. 
DWIGHT: You are clean. Okay  One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide  I am going to generate myself into a human trap.  When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing.  
DWIGHT: You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there. 
DWIGHT: You are kidding me! 
DWIGHT: You are out of order. 
DWIGHT: You are the future! 
DWIGHT: You are the master. 
DWIGHT: You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.  
DWIGHT: You are? 
DWIGHT: You believe a computer can beat me? 
DWIGHT: You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful. 
DWIGHT: You can be so modest sometimes. 
DWIGHT: You can refer to me as Mister Schrute. 
DWIGHT: You can t have someone murdered. 
DWIGHT: You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me? 
DWIGHT: You can't do that. 
DWIGHT: You can't fire me, I don't work in this van! 
DWIGHT: You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year ...as impish!   
DWIGHT: You can't just move out. 
DWIGHT: You can't possibly be serious. 
DWIGHT: You can't see... You can't see my stomach. 
DWIGHT: You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy. 
DWIGHT: You can't steal what is legally your property. Bob 
DWIGHT: You can't tantalize me. 
DWIGHT: You can't. 
DWIGHT: You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do?  What can I do?  What can I do? What can I do? 
DWIGHT: You choose! 
DWIGHT: You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok? 
DWIGHT: You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive. 
DWIGHT: You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner. 
DWIGHT: You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do. 
DWIGHT: You couldn't handle my undivided attention. 
DWIGHT: You did get the e-vite to my barbeque! 
DWIGHT: You did not just say that! You don t know Pam. She is really cool. 
DWIGHT: You did this for me?  
DWIGHT: You did this, didn't you? 
DWIGHT: You did. 
DWIGHT: You did. Several times. Over and over again. 
DWIGHT: You did? 
DWIGHT: You didn't have to. 
DWIGHT: You didn't have to... 
DWIGHT: You didn't poison me, it's just stress. 
DWIGHT: You don t need to repeat right now, when I m saying it. 
DWIGHT: You don't crack a case. That has pejorative connotation. That's like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty. 
DWIGHT: You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day. 
DWIGHT: You don't have email on your phone. 
DWIGHT: You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting. 
DWIGHT: You don't keep a diary. 
DWIGHT: You don't know what you need. Just... 
DWIGHT: You don't know? 
DWIGHT: You don't like the Beatles? 
DWIGHT: You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous... for stripping. 
DWIGHT: You don't want to know. 
DWIGHT: You don't work here! You're not Jim! 
DWIGHT: You don't work with us. 
DWIGHT: You dressed exactly like the servants. 
DWIGHT: You drove over that. Go back   
DWIGHT: You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn t even know it. I ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh.  Silly me. Gotta take the stairs. 
DWIGHT: You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues. 
DWIGHT: You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion? 
DWIGHT: You failed? 
DWIGHT: You get half now and half upon completion of said job. 
DWIGHT: You got a better way? 
DWIGHT: You got me!  I used to collect them! 
DWIGHT: You got this kosher certified? 
DWIGHT: You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God! 
DWIGHT: You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall... 
DWIGHT: You guys should use a hand truck. 
DWIGHT: You had black hair and then gray hair. 
DWIGHT: You had to, what other choice did you have? 
DWIGHT: You have information about the sex predator? 
DWIGHT: You have it? 
DWIGHT: You have never been cooler. 
DWIGHT: You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was  poisoned  by Aunt Shirley. 
DWIGHT: You have till five. 
DWIGHT: You have to interview me... 
DWIGHT: You have to tell me. 
DWIGHT: You have your lawyer there? 
DWIGHT: You haven t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke  Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station . You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let s go over membership. I m going to need the first month s and the last month s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month  
DWIGHT: You haven't buried her yet? 
DWIGHT: You heard me! 
DWIGHT: You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch. 
DWIGHT: You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea. 
DWIGHT: You know how I feel about IHOP. 
DWIGHT: You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality. 
DWIGHT: You know it. 
DWIGHT: You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours. 
DWIGHT: You know there's a ghost in this office 
DWIGHT: You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it. 
DWIGHT: You know we live together, right? 
DWIGHT: You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity.  
DWIGHT: You know what to do.  Ok 
DWIGHT: You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it. 
DWIGHT: You know what you need? Closure. 
DWIGHT: You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test? 
DWIGHT: You know what? 
DWIGHT: You know what? 
DWIGHT: You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit. 
DWIGHT: You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse. 
DWIGHT: You know what? I made you a cd... 
DWIGHT: You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs. 
DWIGHT: You know what? I'm a little busy. 
DWIGHT: You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you.  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year! 
DWIGHT: You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure. 
DWIGHT: You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer. 
DWIGHT: You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper. 
DWIGHT: You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual. 
DWIGHT: You know what? Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me. I'm the man for this job. Charles, you got my back on this? 
DWIGHT: You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize. David Wallace's 
DWIGHT: You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast! Gym 
DWIGHT: You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis. 
DWIGHT: You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now. 
DWIGHT: You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye. 
DWIGHT: You know what? You re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance. 
DWIGHT: You know where it is. Lead me there. 
DWIGHT: You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero. 
DWIGHT: You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum. 
DWIGHT: You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early. 
DWIGHT: You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic. 
DWIGHT: You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group? 
DWIGHT: You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass.  
DWIGHT: You know, I would love to put a pin in that. 
DWIGHT: You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it. 
DWIGHT: You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much. 
DWIGHT: You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview. 
DWIGHT: You know, you re right! We hadn t even thought of that, had we boy?  
DWIGHT: You know?  
DWIGHT: You liked it! 
DWIGHT: You ll always have the upper hand, when you ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending. 
DWIGHT: You look as beautiful as the Queen of England. 
DWIGHT: You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo!  Here we go! Yeah! 
DWIGHT: You made a big mistake. Huge! 
DWIGHT: You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just-  
DWIGHT: You may have... 
DWIGHT: You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank? 
DWIGHT: You mean, like a ham? 
DWIGHT: You must use a lot of paper. 
DWIGHT: You need- 
DWIGHT: You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do. 
DWIGHT: You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes. 
DWIGHT: You need to do something about your B.O. 
DWIGHT: You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane. 
DWIGHT: You needed to speak to me? 
DWIGHT: You never know. Better safe than sorry. 
DWIGHT: You okay, Robert? 
DWIGHT: You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls. We'd have to shut this place down for a week. 
DWIGHT: You people.  Come on. You're sleeping with me. 
DWIGHT: You promised us whales. These are worms. 
DWIGHT: You re a good assistant, Jim. 
DWIGHT: You re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram. 
DWIGHT: You re bad. 
DWIGHT: You re being disrespectful! 
DWIGHT: You re not getting my clients! Nice try. 
DWIGHT: You re not stupid. Jazz is stupid. 
DWIGHT: You re really going to want the booster. 
DWIGHT: You re telling me! 
DWIGHT: You re the Quizno s.  Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name? 
DWIGHT: You re welcome. 
DWIGHT: You re working for  Stumpany  too? 
DWIGHT: You read my mind. 
DWIGHT: You really want Packer as your boss? 
DWIGHT: You remember my cousin Mose. 
DWIGHT: You said that Robert was not fulfilling you- 
DWIGHT: You said that we could come to you if we had any questions. 
DWIGHT: You said that? 
DWIGHT: You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America. 
DWIGHT: you said to just... 
DWIGHT: You said you didn't know how to say it. 
DWIGHT: You see? 
DWIGHT: You seem suprised. 
DWIGHT: You should ask her out. 
DWIGHT: You should go. 
DWIGHT: You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today. 
DWIGHT: You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that. 
DWIGHT: You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession. 
DWIGHT: You snubbed her. 
DWIGHT: You speak English? 
DWIGHT: You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams. 
DWIGHT: You stop. 
DWIGHT: You successfully backed down the mob! 
DWIGHT: You sure? 
DWIGHT: You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter. 
DWIGHT: You think I don t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don t need some stupid pill to get me through all this. 
DWIGHT: You think Jim s lying?  That's so cute. I know he's lying. 
DWIGHT: You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf! 
DWIGHT: You throat-rip. 
DWIGHT: You took something that doesn't belong to you. 
DWIGHT: You took that with you. 
DWIGHT: You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He s gonna be moving slowly. It s only  
DWIGHT: You ve had your drink. Now where is my bride? 
DWIGHT: You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive. 
DWIGHT: You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B. 
DWIGHT: You wanna eat, don't you? 
DWIGHT: You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that. 
DWIGHT: You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild. 
DWIGHT: You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree?   ahhmmm  excuse me  What?! Not now, I'm busy. 
DWIGHT: You want a list of my clients? You want my leads? 
DWIGHT: You want me to flush him? 
DWIGHT: You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell.  Todd 
DWIGHT: You want to get sick you go to the hospital. 
DWIGHT: You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job!  And I ll do mine .. walnuts? 
DWIGHT: You wanted to see me? 
DWIGHT: You were being really funny, and then you went too far. 
DWIGHT: You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients. 
DWIGHT: You were late. So, what am I supposed to do? 
DWIGHT: You were making me do things that were not all right. 
DWIGHT: You were on a boat. 
DWIGHT: You weren't even moving.   Okay, sub! 
DWIGHT: You will be. That is the law according to the rules. 
DWIGHT: You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes. 
DWIGHT: You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn t you say? 
DWIGHT: You won t stop until you ve poached us all. 
DWIGHT: You work on commission, don't you? 
DWIGHT: You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb. 
DWIGHT: You would? 
DWIGHT: You! 
DWIGHT: You, you, you, you... Fake 
DWIGHT: You. 
DWIGHT: You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch. 
DWIGHT: You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out... 
DWIGHT: You'll fall in love with her. 
DWIGHT: You'll have Pam to answer to. 
DWIGHT: You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax- 
DWIGHT: You'll see. Here we go. 
DWIGHT: Your clients. They're all mine. 
DWIGHT: Your concern is noted. 
DWIGHT: Your fictitious name? 
DWIGHT: Your foot? 
DWIGHT: Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions. 
DWIGHT: Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist?  You watch it! 
DWIGHT: Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils. 
DWIGHT: Your own paper company. 
DWIGHT: Your path from obesity begins right here! 
DWIGHT: You're an idiot. 
DWIGHT: You're back. 
DWIGHT: You're back.  And you're disgusting. 
DWIGHT: You're gonna like this.  "Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--"  
DWIGHT: You're gonna need to be more specific. 
DWIGHT: You're good. 
DWIGHT: You're insane. 
DWIGHT: You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back. 
DWIGHT: You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine. 
DWIGHT: You're kidding me.  Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist. 
DWIGHT: You're leaving? 
DWIGHT: You're lying. We didn't win. 
DWIGHT: You're married.  He's married! 
DWIGHT: You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her!   All you do is dress fancy and sing.   "La la la la la la la la la la!" What does that mean? You can't even protect her! 
DWIGHT: You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian Fake 
DWIGHT: You're not off to a very good start, Bernard. 
DWIGHT: You're not on anything? 
DWIGHT: You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass. 
DWIGHT: You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh? 
DWIGHT: You're number four. 
DWIGHT: You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height. 
DWIGHT: You're really putting me in an awkward position here. 
DWIGHT: You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid. 
DWIGHT: You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was,  "What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him." And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly.  Ohhh... mmm... 
DWIGHT: You're right. OK everyone, back to work. 
DWIGHT: You're so immature! 
DWIGHT: You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours? 
DWIGHT: You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid? 
DWIGHT: You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger. 
DWIGHT: You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha! 
DWIGHT: You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting? 
DWIGHT: You're the best. 
DWIGHT: You're the stupid one. 
DWIGHT: You're the stupid one. 
DWIGHT: You're thinking of a chicken. 
DWIGHT: You're thinking of deer penis. 
DWIGHT: You're twenty minutes late! 
DWIGHT: You're wearing loafers! 
DWIGHT: You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok? David 
DWIGHT: You're welcome. 
DWIGHT: You're welcome. 
DWIGHT: You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.

DWIGHT: You've done more then you can possibly know. 
DWIGHT: You've got a ton of dandruff. 
DWIGHT: You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race. 
DWIGHT: You've got to tell Andy about us. 
DWIGHT: You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team.  AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

ERIN:  For Pete's sake it just needs to be done!  
ERIN:  Forth aggenda! 
ERIN:  Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi. 
ERIN:  Gabe! 
ERIN:  Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other! 
ERIN:  Get in quick. 
ERIN:  Go Meredith. Nice moves. 
ERIN:  Go on. I have warm blood.  
ERIN:  Going to Pennsylvania. 
ERIN:  Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much!  That guy's hilarious. He's here today.  
ERIN:  Hello, waffle iron. 
ERIN:  Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo. Elderly 
ERIN:  He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want. 
ERIN:  Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth.  
ERIN:  Hey! Wanna play hookey today? 
ERIN:  Hey, Andy. 
ERIN:  Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that? 
ERIN:  Hey. 
ERIN:  Hey. 
ERIN:  Hmmm! 
ERIN:  Hopped off the train in Scranton, PA, another cloudy gray afternoon. Jumped in the cab, here you are for the first time, look to the right see the "Electric City" sign. This is gonna be good day, for Dunder Mifflin and Sob-ray. Sab -  
ERIN:  I am so happy you're eating again. 
ERIN:  I can't hear what you said.  You got your slop?  
ERIN:  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?  
ERIN:  I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred. 
ERIN:  I have to go Phyllis. 
ERIN:  I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one. 
ERIN:  I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me. 
ERIN:  I need the most special thing in the office. 
ERIN:  I saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas day, on Christmas day... 
ERIN:  I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though. 
ERIN:  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario. 
ERIN:  I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie.  and then I want my nap! 
ERIN:  I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe?  Oh well. 
ERIN:  I... I don't think I can do that. 
ERIN:  If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself. 
ERIN:  I'm still Andy's girlfriend. 
ERIN:  Is he looking?  Oh. You can stop. 
ERIN:  Is this a joke? 
ERIN:  It's either taping or calling. Andy & 
ERIN:  It's good. I really hope you get it! 
ERIN:  It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice? 
ERIN:  It's Michael! 
ERIN:  It's that I wish Jessica was dead. 
ERIN:  It's the fuzz! 
ERIN:  I've done it all my life. 
ERIN:  Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim. 
ERIN:  Just don't tell Andy, because.. 
ERIN:  Just get in! Get in! Just get in! 
ERIN:  Maybe you should mind your own business.  Just kidding! 
ERIN:  Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to. 
ERIN:  Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie? 
ERIN:  Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine- 
ERIN:  No. 
ERIN:  Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us. 
ERIN:  Of course, Nathaniel. 
ERIN:  Oh Dwight! 
ERIN:  Oh yeah, big time lice. 
ERIN:  Oh! 
ERIN:  Oh! 
ERIN:  Oh! Andy! 
ERIN:  Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon.  Thanks. 
ERIN:  Oh, gosh. Todd 
ERIN:  Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt. 
ERIN:  Oh, Pete, you ve got mail. 
ERIN:  Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard. 
ERIN:  Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog! 
ERIN:  Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend. 
ERIN:  Oh. 
ERIN:  Oh. Cool. 
ERIN:  Okay, sorry. 
ERIN:  Okay. 
ERIN:  Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away. 
ERIN:  Ooh yabber, lice! 
ERIN:  Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok.  
ERIN:  Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1. 
ERIN:  S il vous plait dites-Moi Ugggghhh les Bleagh! 
ERIN:  Savannah? That's a far way from Scranton. 
ERIN:  Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot. I am so sorry. 
ERIN:  Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower. 
ERIN:  Sorry. 
ERIN:  Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 
ERIN:  Stop. 
ERIN:  Terrific! 
ERIN:  That's my favorite. 
ERIN:  The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting!  
ERIN:  The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns. 
ERIN:  They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house.  
ERIN:  Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.  
ERIN:  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times. 
ERIN:  Uhm, I'm not going to my room. 
ERIN:  Uh-oh... 
ERIN:  Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond. 
ERIN:  Wanna play catch in the parking lot? 
ERIN:  Welcome back! 
ERIN:  We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months. David 
ERIN:  What color is it? 
ERIN:  What? 
ERIN:  What? 
ERIN:  Where are you taking me? 
ERIN:  Yeah, but I'm confused... 
ERIN:  Yeah. 
ERIN:  Yeah. 
ERIN:  Yes! Woo! 
ERIN:  Yes.  Welcome back, buddy. 
ERIN:  Yikers, lice. 
ERIN:  You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today. 
ERIN:  You did this? 
ERIN:  You love drama. 
ERIN:  You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it!  
ERIN:  You wanted to see me? 
ERIN:  You're famous. 
ERIN: "Nip slip." 
ERIN: "Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue." Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt! 
ERIN: $300. 
ERIN: ...Help me feel better... 
ERIN: ..just have some messages for you. 
ERIN: A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard!  
ERIN: A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn t bad. 
ERIN: A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy? 
ERIN: A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events. 
ERIN: A lot of fun. 
ERIN: A paper company. 
ERIN: A thousand. 
ERIN: A year? You were together for a year? 
ERIN: Absolutely. 
ERIN: Absolutely. 
ERIN: Absolutely. I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help. 
ERIN: Absolutely. Works for me. 
ERIN: According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese. 
ERIN: Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That d be fun. 
ERIN: Addor! 
ERIN: After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me. 
ERIN: Ah!  That's enough. 
ERIN: Ah! Angela had the baby! 
ERIN: Ah! Love to learn. 
ERIN: Ah, no. Right month, wrong year. 
ERIN: Ahh!  Walter 
ERIN: All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so  
ERIN: All right. 
ERIN: All that color. 
ERIN: Alright. 
ERIN: Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries. 
ERIN: Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages. 
ERIN: And Andy is the manager, not Nellie! 
ERIN: And did you get the tickets? 
ERIN: And here's the fax for you. 
ERIN: And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe... 
ERIN: And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup. 
ERIN: And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss.  Ah!  OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say  get a drink .  
ERIN: And she s never called here. Unless it s your mom. 
ERIN: And then we had him  Like  Dunder Mifflin. 
ERIN: And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl. 
ERIN: And we did. 
ERIN: And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels? 
ERIN: And you have any advice or anything? 
ERIN: And, you're my friend. 
ERIN: And... 
ERIN: Andy- 
ERIN: Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no.  
ERIN: Andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt! 
ERIN: Andy s coming back today! 
ERIN: Andy s coming back today! Andy s coming back today! Ha! Andy s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time. 
ERIN: Andy s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy s here. Pam, he s here.  
ERIN: Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time. 
ERIN: Andy wait!  Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I m sorry. 
ERIN: Andy wants us to, P-Dog. 
ERIN: Andy you look awful! 
ERIN: Andy! 
ERIN: Andy! 
ERIN: Andy! 
ERIN: Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex? 
ERIN: Andy, don t go in there! 
ERIN: Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all. 
ERIN: Andy, I care about you and I think-- 
ERIN: Andy, if you re gonna hang out for a while, uh  
ERIN: Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you. 
ERIN: Andy, whoa! Thank you very much! 
ERIN: Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else? 
ERIN: Andy, you don t want that. 
ERIN: Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man. 
ERIN: Andy. 
ERIN: Andy. 
ERIN: Andy. 
ERIN: Andy.  
ERIN: Andy... 
ERIN: Andy? 
ERIN: Andy? 
ERIN: Andy?  
ERIN: Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh. 
ERIN: Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused. 
ERIN: Andy's just coming as my date. 
ERIN: Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end. 
ERIN: Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo. 
ERIN: Apoplexy. 
ERIN: Are you alright? 
ERIN: Are you good at jigsaw puzzles? 
ERIN: Are you in a lot of pain? 
ERIN: Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs. 
ERIN: Are you okay? Broccoli 
ERIN: Are you sure? It s really, really important. 
ERIN: As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain. 
ERIN: As long as you guys don't need me up here. 
ERIN: Ashley! You made it! 
ERIN: Aw! 
ERIN: Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids. 
ERIN: Aw, heck ya! 
ERIN: Aww, cute. 
ERIN: Azem choma! Chomakka-attun! 
ERIN: Bahamas, Andy. 
ERIN: Because I squat with five pounds. This-  yeah, this feels like more than that. Senator 
ERIN: Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing. 
ERIN: Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing "moo", I'm playing "milk". Whatever it takes. 
ERIN: Because of your slaves. 
ERIN: Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up! 
ERIN: Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve. 
ERIN: Buenos dias, Miguel.  Hello, Dunder-Mifflin. 
ERIN: Building loyalty. 
ERIN: But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake. 
ERIN: But it's not for-- 
ERIN: But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I? 
ERIN: But there s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it. 
ERIN: But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It s such a great cause. 
ERIN: But why not find out. 
ERIN: But you can leave your arm.   
ERIN: But you hurt your hand. 
ERIN: But, that s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam.  Unless you want me to break protocol? 
ERIN: But, there's no clue. 
ERIN: But... they're penises. 
ERIN: Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please.  This isn t stupid. 
ERIN: Bye. 
ERIN: Call, text or e-mail, or call. 
ERIN: Can I help you? 
ERIN: Can we talk about this later, I have to go. 
ERIN: Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy. 
ERIN: Can you just do it? 
ERIN: 'Cause America was discovered. 
ERIN: Chocolates. 
ERIN: Clark's a dead man. 
ERIN: Close. 
ERIN: Coco Leche! That's my favorite! 
ERIN: Colder. 
ERIN: Come on!  
ERIN: Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it! 
ERIN: Come on, don't you want to play? 
ERIN: Come on. I was in line before you. 
ERIN: Come on. You got this. Here. 
ERIN: Cool. Thanks. 
ERIN: Copy that. 
ERIN: Country roads, take me home, to the place...  Sorry. I like that song. You're good! 
ERIN: Dammit! Dammit, god.  Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels. 
ERIN: Dang it! What the heck already? 
ERIN: Darryl. 
ERIN: Darryl?! Darryl! 
ERIN: David Wallace is calling. 
ERIN: David Wallace is on line two for you guys. 
ERIN: Deangelo, did you order a barber? 
ERIN: DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you. 
ERIN: Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know? 
ERIN: Did it affect you outside of the office? 
ERIN: Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio? 
ERIN: Did you grow up around here? 
ERIN: Did you write this? 
ERIN: Di-Did you say vampire? 
ERIN: Didn t you get the memo? It s Stairmageddon!  Come on Stanley!  
ERIN: Die hard. Every line. Go. 
ERIN: Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today. 
ERIN: Do a hundred jumping jacks. 
ERIN: Do I still have a job here? 
ERIN: Do they not like me, though? 
ERIN: Do you even know what you're doing? 
ERIN: Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church? 
ERIN: Do you need a hand? 
ERIN: Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me? 
ERIN: Do you think they canceled the wedding? 
ERIN: Do you want me off the call too Michael? 
ERIN: Do you want me to go back to the store? 
ERIN: Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy? 
ERIN: Do you want to keep this? 
ERIN: Do you want to keep this? 
ERIN: Does he have a flipper? 
ERIN: Don't change the subject. 
ERIN: Don't mind us. You keep working. 
ERIN: Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories? 
ERIN: Dothraas! chek!  
ERIN: Drive carefully! 
ERIN: Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sob-ray. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre.  
ERIN: Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day. 
ERIN: Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today? 
ERIN: Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you. 
ERIN: Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it! 
ERIN: Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file.  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client! 
ERIN: Dwight  
ERIN: Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages. 
ERIN: Dwight gives the best back massages. 
ERIN: Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It s a   Mageddon!  
ERIN: Dwight! 
ERIN: Dwight, are you okay!? 
ERIN: Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together. 
ERIN: Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you. 
ERIN: Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what. 
ERIN: Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language. 
ERIN: Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are. 
ERIN: Dwight's car is gone. 
ERIN: Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go. 
ERIN: 'Erin123' 
ERIN: Every martini has an olive. 
ERIN: Everyday is fine. Or... 
ERIN: Exactly. 
ERIN: Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I- Wally 
ERIN: farts popcorn. 
ERIN: Fine. 
ERIN: Fire him. No, show mercy. 
ERIN: Flying jib. 
ERIN: For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica. 
ERIN: For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon. 
ERIN: For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon. 
ERIN: Foth aggenda! 
ERIN: Foth aggendak! 
ERIN: Foth aggendi! 
ERIN: Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day? There's a bunch of those. 
ERIN: Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with. 
ERIN: From my secret admirer. That's you! 
ERIN: Fun! 
ERIN: Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee. 
ERIN: Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great. 
ERIN: Gabe seemed to think no one was going. 
ERIN: Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital. 
ERIN: Gabe! 
ERIN: Gabe! 
ERIN: Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican. 
ERIN: Gabe, I don't- 
ERIN: Gabe? 
ERIN: Game on. 
ERIN: Gee, he was salty. 
ERIN: Geez louise. 
ERIN: Get away from the car, he's gonna see you. 
ERIN: Get out of here! 
ERIN: Get upstairs, mister! 
ERIN: Getting things done. Awesome! 
ERIN: Go! Okay. Yeah. 
ERIN: Go! Video 
ERIN: God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy. 
ERIN: Good me too! 
ERIN: Good morning, Meredith. 
ERIN: Good morning. 
ERIN: Good. 
ERIN: Good. We don't need her. 
ERIN: Goodbye for a very very long time. 
ERIN: Got it, bimbo.  
ERIN: Got it.  Oh, Oscar. Oscar? 
ERIN: Got it. For Channel 11 news...  
ERIN: Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her. 
ERIN: Gotcha.  
ERIN: Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving. 
ERIN: Great. 
ERIN: Great. 
ERIN: Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix. Carla 
ERIN: Gummi bears and gummi worms. 
ERIN: Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it. 
ERIN: Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow? 
ERIN: Guys, who's Holly? 
ERIN: Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands. 
ERIN: Ha! 
ERIN: Haho! 
ERIN: Hanks. Jim and 
ERIN: He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox. 
ERIN: He didn't even say that. 
ERIN: He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it. 
ERIN: He just rolled out and crawled out. 
ERIN: He only emailed me four times. 
ERIN: He s absolutely right. I m really struggling. 
ERIN: He s in the bathroom. 
ERIN: He said limousine, so... 
ERIN: He says no. 
ERIN: He says salvation. No last name. 
ERIN: He sounds like an idiot. 
ERIN: Hello, Peter. 
ERIN: Hello. 
ERIN: Hello. 
ERIN: Hello. 
ERIN: Hello. 
ERIN: Hello. Sorry guys.  Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop. 
ERIN: Here-  
ERIN: Here we go. 
ERIN: Here you go. 
ERIN: Here you go.  
ERIN: He's around here somewhere. 
ERIN: He's coming. 
ERIN: He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse. 
ERIN: He's just gonna call back. 
ERIN: He's more than substantial. He's a monster. 
ERIN: He's my foster brother. 
ERIN: He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me- 
ERIN: He's not looking.  Hey! 
ERIN: He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him. 
ERIN: He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met. 
ERIN: Hey Creed. 
ERIN: Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper. 
ERIN: Hey guys, any spots left? 
ERIN: Hey guys. 
ERIN: Hey la, hey la... 
ERIN: Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do--- 
ERIN: Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. 
ERIN: Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory? 
ERIN: Hey sailor! Come watch it over here!  
ERIN: Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening. 
ERIN: Hey! 
ERIN: Hey! Gabe.

ERIN: Hey, Andy, is this at all work related? 
ERIN: Hey, Angela! Welcome to - 
ERIN: Hey, are you okay? 
ERIN: Hey, Dwight Snoot. 
ERIN: Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy. 
ERIN: 'Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.' 
ERIN: Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK?  And you both have such beautiful hair. 
ERIN: Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest. 
ERIN: Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish. 
ERIN: Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see. 
ERIN: Hey, my name s Tabitha. I m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it s working. There s already people camped out behind me. 
ERIN: Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now. 
ERIN: Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know? 
ERIN: Hey, you were in there forever. 
ERIN: Hey. 
ERIN: Hey.

ERIN: Hi Michael.  
ERIN: Hi! 
ERIN: Hi, guys. How you doing? 
ERIN: Hi. 
ERIN: Hi. 
ERIN: Hi. 
ERIN: Hi. 
ERIN: Hi. 
ERIN: Hi. 
ERIN: Hi. 
ERIN: Hit 'er up. 
ERIN: Hmm. 
ERIN: Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts. 
ERIN: Holy cow. I'd be so happy. 
ERIN: Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice! 
ERIN: Hoo-hoo! 
ERIN: How about you? 
ERIN: How are you doing? Is it really rough? 
ERIN: How are you? How's your family doing? 
ERIN: How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales? 
ERIN: How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work? 
ERIN: How do you know where I live? 
ERIN: How do you return coffee? 
ERIN: How is everything? How's your car? 
ERIN: How long were you guys together? 
ERIN: How long will he be gone? 
ERIN: How many pillows do you sleep on at night? 
ERIN: How s Florida? 
ERIN: How was the dentist? 
ERIN: Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl? 
ERIN: I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush? 
ERIN: I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something. 
ERIN: I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt. 
ERIN: I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry. 
ERIN: I am? Hmm..  Hi, I m Mr. Hannon. How can I help you? 
ERIN: I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said  coffee . 
ERIN: I bet it s Katie Couric. I ve been saying this for years. 
ERIN: I bet. You guys. 
ERIN: I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it. 
ERIN: I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean. 
ERIN: I can't trust Andy anymore. 
ERIN: I can't, 'cause there's no clue. 
ERIN: I can't. I- 
ERIN: I care if you like him. 
ERIN: I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour. 
ERIN: I couldn't do it. 
ERIN: I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl.  
ERIN: I did. I got some really good sleep. 
ERIN: I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you! 
ERIN: I didn't feel anything. 
ERIN: I didn't know we had a tape measure. 
ERIN: I didn't want to miss it. 
ERIN: I do really want him. 
ERIN: I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head. 
ERIN: I don t know. I ve just always been really good at dancing. 
ERIN: I don t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone s trust. About the pens. 
ERIN: I don't feel like it either! 
ERIN: I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it! 
ERIN: I don't have one. 
ERIN: I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so... 
ERIN: I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends. 
ERIN: I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis? 
ERIN: I don't know what to say. 
ERIN: I don't know, I just haven't. 
ERIN: I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!!  
ERIN: I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city. 
ERIN: I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute.  
ERIN: I don't know. 
ERIN: I don't know. It was lunch, Andy. 
ERIN: I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest. 
ERIN: I don't know. This looks pretty legit.  Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land. 
ERIN: I don't know. Window treatment 
ERIN: I don't love you anymore. 
ERIN: I don't think so. I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin. 
ERIN: I don't wanna be a lousy snitch. 
ERIN: I don't want anyone to die. 
ERIN: I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not? 
ERIN: I don't want you to shave everything. 
ERIN: I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe. 
ERIN: I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush. 
ERIN: I feel it working.  Eiffel tower! 
ERIN: I get it. 
ERIN: I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's. 
ERIN: I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh! 
ERIN: I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him. 
ERIN: I guess we don t have a choice. 
ERIN: I guess we just have to wait until night and see. 
ERIN: I guess. 
ERIN: I had no idea. And here I ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin  sheep. 
ERIN: I hate it! I hate your car! 
ERIN: I hate your roof! 
ERIN: I have a job here. I work for an old lady.  
ERIN: I have really enjoyed our time together. 
ERIN: I haven't seen it. 
ERIN: I haven't seen it. 
ERIN: I heard it from Michael. 
ERIN: I hope you find what you're looking for. 
ERIN: I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone. 
ERIN: I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home. 
ERIN: I just said there isn't love. 
ERIN: I just... there's always one around. 
ERIN: I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts. 
ERIN: I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch. 
ERIN: I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else. 
ERIN: I know this is going to be a great payoff. 
ERIN: I know who you are, and I think you should go. 
ERIN: I know. 
ERIN: I know. 
ERIN: I know. I meant I'd be happy for them. 
ERIN: I know. That s great. It just - it makes it look like there s an eyebrow in the middle of your face. 
ERIN: I know. You get to pick. 
ERIN: I like how guys just know stuff all the time. 
ERIN: I like my new group. I liked my old group. 
ERIN: I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home. 
ERIN: I m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven t done anything. 
ERIN: I m so happy for you Kelly. 
ERIN: I m sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now . This game is called  pecker Poker .  It s the game of cards that gets you hard. 
ERIN: I m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz. 
ERIN: I mean, it says "X-Mas party," but I think we all know what that's code for. 
ERIN: I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon? 
ERIN: I played "ape." 
ERIN: I really love your outfit. 
ERIN: I really think you should leave. 
ERIN: I really think you're better off. 
ERIN: I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend. 
ERIN: I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club. 
ERIN: I see it.  I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of  and facing, and I'm like... 
ERIN: I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that? 
ERIN: I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you. 
ERIN: I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course. 
ERIN: I think he's around here... 
ERIN: I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok? 
ERIN: I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave. 
ERIN: I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing. 
ERIN: I think we should toast... 
ERIN: I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with. 
ERIN: I thought I needed to know for your calendar. 
ERIN: I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game. 
ERIN: I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America. Boat 
ERIN: I thought that's what you were doing. 
ERIN: I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr. 
ERIN: I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing. 
ERIN: I want to continue working on our friendship. 
ERIN: I want to throw up just thinking about it. 
ERIN: I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press. 
ERIN: I was ahead of you! 
ERIN: I was flirting with a man. 
ERIN: I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like,  What's your stance on politics?  Or,  What is the best war to do?  And, I will just be like,  Duhhhh!  
ERIN: I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager? 
ERIN: I wasn't recording it. 
ERIN: I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet! 
ERIN: I went to Portugal. 
ERIN: I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay. 
ERIN: I wish I had seen you do it. 
ERIN: I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose. 
ERIN: I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth. 
ERIN: I would have chosen the 1490's. 
ERIN: I would like another alcohol. 
ERIN: I, really don't like spending time with him. 
ERIN: I... 
ERIN: If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name. 
ERIN: If you want to sit on this--  I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis. Make it softer. 
ERIN: I'll go with you. 
ERIN: I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof! 
ERIN: I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six. 
ERIN: I'm Erin Hannon. 
ERIN: I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back. 
ERIN: I'm hungry. 
ERIN: I'm in my jammy-jams! 
ERIN: I'm in the bathroom. 
ERIN: I'm in. 
ERIN: I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there! 
ERIN: I'm moving down here, you know. 
ERIN: I'm not attracted to Kevin. 
ERIN: I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam?  Thank you for hearing me. 
ERIN: I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine. 
ERIN: I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game. 
ERIN: I'm ready. 
ERIN: I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life! 
ERIN: I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive. 
ERIN: I'm so sorry I was so sick.  
ERIN: I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy. 
ERIN: I'm sorry to have wasted your time. 
ERIN: I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see. 
ERIN: I'm sorry. 
ERIN: I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything. 
ERIN: I'm sure he'll be fine. 
ERIN: I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him. 
ERIN: I'm trying to save you from yourself! 
ERIN: I'm trying. Sorry. 
ERIN: I'm young, and I can   and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young. 
ERIN: Important. 
ERIN: In the Foster home, my hair was my room.  
ERIN: In your schedule it just says nine til noon is "creative space" and I thought this could be part of that. 
ERIN: Interesting. 
ERIN: Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her.  I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me. 
ERIN: Irene, what would you do without me? 
ERIN: Is he really five pounds? 
ERIN: Is it you?  
ERIN: Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain? 
ERIN: Is--do the people-- 
ERIN: It s just Pete in sunglasses. 
ERIN: It s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person. 
ERIN: It stings a lot. 
ERIN: It was a little much Andy. 
ERIN: It was Andy, wasn't it? 
ERIN: It's a cafe disco. 
ERIN: It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain. 
ERIN: It's about you. 
ERIN: It's Andy's fault. 
ERIN: It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say "Who's hungry?" 
ERIN: It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit? 
ERIN: It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along. 
ERIN: It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows. 
ERIN: It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all. 
ERIN: It's pronounced wacko. 
ERIN: It's right here in PA. 
ERIN: It's so edgy! 
ERIN: It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60. 
ERIN: I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant. 
ERIN: I've been turned into a puppet! 
ERIN: I've got this!  Charge! Go! Go!  
ERIN: I've heard that's amazing when it works. 
ERIN: I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet. 
ERIN: Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug.  I'm Erin. 
ERIN: Jim, are you in? 
ERIN: Jim, come on. I thought we were past this. 
ERIN: Jim, Dwight, what are your last names? 
ERIN: Jim.  
ERIN: Jim... 
ERIN: Jim? Tell them what it's called. 
ERIN: Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate. 
ERIN: Just forget it. Forget I said anything. David 
ERIN: Just got some ice. 
ERIN: Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way. 
ERIN: Just the two of us. 
ERIN: Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward. 
ERIN: Justine. She said she s coming by later. 
ERIN: Kelly got into the minority training program. 
ERIN: Kelly has an eating disorder? 
ERIN: Kelly! Great costume! 
ERIN: Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry. 
ERIN: Lately, I ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic. 
ERIN: Let's do it! 
ERIN: Let's get out of here. 
ERIN: Let's go. 
ERIN: Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna- 
ERIN: Lice. More lice.  Angela has lice. 
ERIN: Like a benign tumor. 
ERIN: Like the cow mood yesterday. God. 
ERIN: Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here. 
ERIN: Line 2. 
ERIN: Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we ll get this started. 
ERIN: Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear. 
ERIN: Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael! 
ERIN: Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money.  Listen to me, bragging away. 
ERIN: Look who I found!  
ERIN: Lower  
ERIN: Lower. 
ERIN: Lunch was fine. 
ERIN: Maybe in six months- 
ERIN: Maybe sometimes. But not like  hate  hate. More just like,  Mom, I hate you!  And then she would say  go to your room, young lady.  And I d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we d just have dinner together. But I don t know. I d have to meet her. Thanks. 
ERIN: Maybe we should just go. 
ERIN: Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together. 
ERIN: Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office. 
ERIN: Maybe, ok? Let me think about it. 
ERIN: Me too. So much. I'm so happy. 
ERIN: Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details. 
ERIN: Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there. 
ERIN: Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks, 
ERIN: Michael! 
ERIN: Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips. 
ERIN: Michael, could I talk to you privately? 
ERIN: Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home? 
ERIN: Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk. 
ERIN: Michael, people are asking questions. 
ERIN: Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call. 
ERIN: Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people. 
ERIN: Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some  help so,  he was wondering if you could help him.  
ERIN: Michael? 
ERIN: Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now? 
ERIN: Michael? The limo's here for you. 
ERIN: Mm! 
ERIN: Mm.   
ERIN: Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm  
ERIN: Mm-hmm. 
ERIN: Mm-Mmm. 
ERIN: Movie is starting. 
ERIN: Mush, mush, mush! Come on! 
ERIN: My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we re not really friends. Old 
ERIN: Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal. 
ERIN: Navy blue. Little red anchors. 
ERIN: Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously. 
ERIN: Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force. 
ERIN: Never say that. 
ERIN: Next! 
ERIN: Nice! Boat 
ERIN: Nice. 
ERIN: Night Michael. 
ERIN: No   just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff. 
ERIN: No! 
ERIN: No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house!  
ERIN: No, actually most of them went to go see a movie. 
ERIN: No, all we need is mayonnaise. 
ERIN: No, come on. 
ERIN: No, go ahead. 
ERIN: No, he's not making this up. 
ERIN: No, he's not. 
ERIN: No, I don't have any stuff. 
ERIN: No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it s the truth, I swear. 
ERIN: No, I m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen. 
ERIN: No, I m not!  It s not like that at all! Forget it, I m so sorry. 
ERIN: No, I meant you re getting colder. The correct response is,  the coffee in Peru is much hotter.  
ERIN: No, I watch the news. 
ERIN: No, j-l-p. Like, "I jlp... I jlp you!" 
ERIN: No, no, no, he's not looking. 
ERIN: No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats... 
ERIN: No, of course not. It s just   I think it s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it s like, where does it end? So just   
ERIN: No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy. 
ERIN: No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears. 
ERIN: No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me. 
ERIN: No, you go -- okay. 
ERIN: No, you stop. 
ERIN: No, you? 
ERIN: No. 
ERIN: No. 
ERIN: No. 
ERIN: No. 
ERIN: No. 
ERIN: No. 
ERIN: No. 
ERIN: No. 
ERIN: No.  Did you? 
ERIN: No. No more talking. It's movie time. 
ERIN: Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun. 
ERIN: None of this makes any sense to me! 
ERIN: None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen. 
ERIN: Nothing. It's wide open. 
ERIN: Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe. 
ERIN: November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month! 
ERIN: Now I do got it. 
ERIN: Now we only have four strikes left until a home run. 
ERIN: Of course, seriously. Get your coat on. 
ERIN: Of course. 
ERIN: Oh  
ERIN: Oh God! 
ERIN: Oh god. 
ERIN: Oh hey, didn't see you. 
ERIN: Oh I know. 
ERIN: Oh it's...  
ERIN: Oh just by like friends. 
ERIN: Oh my god! 
ERIN: Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest!   
ERIN: Oh my God. 
ERIN: Oh my God. 
ERIN: Oh my gosh! 
ERIN: Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous! 
ERIN: Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots. 
ERIN: Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops. 
ERIN: Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly. 
ERIN: Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back. 
ERIN: Oh sure. 
ERIN: Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out 
ERIN: Oh well, Andy, we re not moving to Cornell. 
ERIN: Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It s not a nice letter. 
ERIN: Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy.  He's seriously juvenile. 
ERIN: Oh yeah. What else you got? 
ERIN: Oh! 
ERIN: Oh! 
ERIN: Oh! 
ERIN: Oh!  
ERIN: Oh!  
ERIN: Oh!   
ERIN: Oh! Darryl's funny. 
ERIN: Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends. 
ERIN: Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car. 
ERIN: Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water? 
ERIN: Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it. 
ERIN: Oh, assist. 
ERIN: Oh, boy! ... What's that sound? 
ERIN: Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete? 
ERIN: Oh, did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't. 
ERIN: Oh, Dwight. 
ERIN: Oh, god! 
ERIN: Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan. 
ERIN: Oh, guys, it s starting! Hurry! 
ERIN: Oh, I boiled some Gatorade. 
ERIN: Oh, I can go. 
ERIN: Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game? 
ERIN: Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever. 
ERIN: Oh, I just need your signature on this. 
ERIN: Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't. 
ERIN: Oh, I like his butt. 
ERIN: Oh, I m sorry. Didn t you cheat on Andy? 
ERIN: Oh, I put those up. 
ERIN: Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said  is Indian  and was like,  Is Indian what?  Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way. 
ERIN: Oh, is he... 
ERIN: Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that? 
ERIN: Oh, like a goodbye trip. 
ERIN: Oh, my God! What happened? 
ERIN: Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much? 
ERIN: Oh, my God. 
ERIN: Oh, my God. It's a song. 
ERIN: Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner. 
ERIN: Oh, my gosh! 
ERIN: Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion. 
ERIN: Oh, no, I really don t think that s a good idea. 
ERIN: Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents. 
ERIN: Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital? 
ERIN: Oh, no. 
ERIN: Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work. 
ERIN: Oh, okay. 
ERIN: Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it. 
ERIN: Oh, so we don t have to have that talk. 
ERIN: Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes. 
ERIN: Oh, sorry. 
ERIN: Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them. 
ERIN: Oh, thank you. 
ERIN: Oh, thanks. Come in! 
ERIN: Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better. 
ERIN: Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk. 
ERIN: Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend. 
ERIN: Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear. 
ERIN: Oh, uhm, like three months. 
ERIN: Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first. 
ERIN: Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent. 
ERIN: Oh, who else is going? 
ERIN: Oh, yeah! 
ERIN: Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can. 
ERIN: Oh, yeah. 
ERIN: Oh, yeah.  
ERIN: Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that? 
ERIN: Oh, yes. There's a note. "A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss." 
ERIN: Oh, you weren't going to do that? 
ERIN: Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there.  
ERIN: Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ERIN: Oh.  
ERIN: Oh. Come on. 
ERIN: Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths. 
ERIN: Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is. 
ERIN: Oh. Dwight: I want some of those pills. 
ERIN: Oh. Gross. 
ERIN: Oh. Hey, champions. 
ERIN: Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep. 
ERIN: Oh. One Erin Special, please. 
ERIN: Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone. 
ERIN: Oh. Take it up with the chief of police. 
ERIN: Oh. That must be nice. 
ERIN: Oh. They used worse paint than your paint? 
ERIN: Oh... 
ERIN: Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone! 
ERIN: Ohh.  
ERIN: Ohohohoh. 
ERIN: OK! Walt 
ERIN: Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect. 
ERIN: Ok, everybody ready? 
ERIN: Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now. 
ERIN: Ok, well then let's leave like right now. 
ERIN: Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend? 
ERIN: Ok. 
ERIN: OK. 
ERIN: Ok. 
ERIN: OK.  
ERIN: Ok. Let s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one. Just  more adult  more  scary and sexy 
ERIN: Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go? 
ERIN: Okay! 
ERIN: Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that s the end of it. Right, Pete? 
ERIN: Okay, champagne. 
ERIN: Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness. 
ERIN: Okay, good. 
ERIN: Okay, I kill you now. 
ERIN: Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up. 
ERIN: Okay, let's hear it. 
ERIN: Okay, okay. 
ERIN: Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl  
ERIN: Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They re family-owned, but don t let that take away from your edge! 
ERIN: Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods. 
ERIN: Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line.  Senator 
ERIN: Okay. 
ERIN: Okay. 
ERIN: Okay. 
ERIN: Okay. 
ERIN: Okay. 
ERIN: Okay. 
ERIN: Okay. 
ERIN: Okay. 
ERIN: Okay. Alright, bye Cece. 
ERIN: Okay. Hospital 
ERIN: Okay. Okay.  Is that too cold? 
ERIN: Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song. Boom 
ERIN: Okay. We fan out... 
ERIN: Okay... 
ERIN: One dance, all of us together. 
ERIN: One more? 
ERIN: One, two, three.  I did it! I did a cartwheel! 
ERIN: Ooh, "the case of the hit and run," that's exciting. 
ERIN: Ooh, about what? 
ERIN: Ooh, spooky. But why? 
ERIN: Ooh. Wait, Michael? 
ERIN: Oops! 
ERIN: Oops, sorry.  Oops. 
ERIN: Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that... Dwight and 
ERIN: Oscar is with the Senator too? 
ERIN: Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said. 
ERIN: Ow! 
ERIN: Ow. 
ERIN: Oy. Andy, what s going on? 
ERIN: Packer's giving one.  Jim'll probably give ours, I guess. 
ERIN: Pam gave it to me! 
ERIN: Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3? 
ERIN: Pam, pam. Psst. Pam.  
ERIN: Pam, phone call. 
ERIN: Pam, we're all set.  Yum. 
ERIN: Pam, what are you? 
ERIN: Pam. 
ERIN: Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you ve had. Athlead 
ERIN: People say you cry all the time. 
ERIN: Perfect.  
ERIN: Pete and I work well together -- not that there s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I m into girls. Not that I m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question? 
ERIN: Phyllis! 
ERIN: Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don t. And I don t. But I am so excited to be a part of it. 
ERIN: Please! Sorry. Get in.  Sorry sorry sorry. 
ERIN: Probably from seeing that turkey. 
ERIN: Psst! Psst! 
ERIN: Qazer! 
ERIN: Quiet. 
ERIN: Really playing the scales, huh? 
ERIN: Really. It's not a big deal. 
ERIN: Really? 
ERIN: Really? 
ERIN: Really? 
ERIN: Really? 
ERIN: Really? 
ERIN: Really? 
ERIN: Really? Because your mother is dead. 
ERIN: Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon. 
ERIN: Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good. 
ERIN: Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn t stop crying? 
ERIN: Retail consumer habits. 
ERIN: Right now? 
ERIN: Right, yes. 
ERIN: Right. I'm sorry. 
ERIN: Robert California. Let s have a conversation. 
ERIN: Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator-- 
ERIN: Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did.  
ERIN: See? I bet you wouldn t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl? 
ERIN: See? We can all be friends! 
ERIN: Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny. 
ERIN: Seriously? 
ERIN: Seriously? 
ERIN: Service. 
ERIN: She always eats my lunch. 
ERIN: She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month. 
ERIN: She had so much - 
ERIN: She s dead. She was hit by a bus. 
ERIN: She wandered off like an idiot. 
ERIN: Should I tell him you'll call him back? 
ERIN: Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here!  Take 'em yourself! 
ERIN: Six months. 
ERIN: So Andy just called you up out of the blue? 
ERIN: So far no one will admit to it. 
ERIN: So far, we re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big. 
ERIN: So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours. 
ERIN: So I'll see you guys around! 
ERIN: So it's faster. 
ERIN: So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin  song. HCT Member 
ERIN: So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great! 
ERIN: So tell me about your new girlfriend. 
ERIN: So true. Is there a question, or are what? 
ERIN: So what comes next? 
ERIN: So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend. 
ERIN: So, I'm Erin. Hi. 
ERIN: So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but... 
ERIN: So, you must have grown up around somewhere else? 
ERIN: So...  
ERIN: Something came for you, Michael.  
ERIN: Sorry about kicking you out. It s just, we don t want our brand associated with death. Old 
ERIN: Sorry if your special night was ruined. 
ERIN: Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win! 
ERIN: Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here. 
ERIN: Sorry, I uh, just saw your face. 
ERIN: Sorry. 
ERIN: Sorry. 
ERIN: Sorry. 
ERIN: Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela? 
ERIN: Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just... 
ERIN: Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose. 
ERIN: Sounds like a plan, Sugar. 
ERIN: Sponge. 
ERIN: Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day!  
ERIN: Staples?  Uh, David Wallace called. 
ERIN: Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair. 
ERIN: Stop it stop it stop it stop it! 
ERIN: Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous. 
ERIN: Super romantic. 
ERIN: Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator. 
ERIN: Sure, if you are. 
ERIN: Sure. 
ERIN: Sure. 
ERIN: Sure. 
ERIN: Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico? 
ERIN: Sure. Sure we did. 
ERIN: Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off. 
ERIN: Thank you Jim. 
ERIN: Thank you Pam. 
ERIN: Thank you!  
ERIN: Thank you! And two bottles of scotch. 
ERIN: Thank you, goodnight. 
ERIN: Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life.  People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up. 
ERIN: Thank you. 
ERIN: Thank you. 
ERIN: Thank you. 
ERIN: Thank you. 
ERIN: Thank you. 
ERIN: Thank you. 
ERIN: Thanks for covering the phones. 
ERIN: Thanks, Michael. 
ERIN: Thanks. 
ERIN: Thanks. 
ERIN: Thanks. 
ERIN: Thanks. 
ERIN: Thanks. 
ERIN: Thanks. It s on medium. 
ERIN: That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right? 
ERIN: That feels so good! 
ERIN: That was a really rough scene. 
ERIN: That's a really tight argument. 
ERIN: That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle? 
ERIN: That's crazy. 
ERIN: That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it. 
ERIN: That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear. 
ERIN: That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even. 
ERIN: That's OK, I don't want you to do that. 
ERIN: That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though. 
ERIN: That's really great, you guys. 
ERIN: That's rule #1. 
ERIN: That's so random. 
ERIN: That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop.  Oh. I fixed it. 
ERIN: That's why you have a "Sent Mail" folder. 
ERIN: That's yours? 
ERIN: The Bernard family seal. Duh. 
ERIN: The cow jumped over the moon. 
ERIN: The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it s kind of pathetic. But when you re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love. 
ERIN: The movies. I don't know. 
ERIN: The pen delivery went amazing, and now I ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I m not one of those people who s just like,  Uh, sure. I ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand  they are just sitting here. Pam didn t tell me not to unpack them. Don t want to be a busybody, but I don t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it s insane! I m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I ve never had an espresso before. They re good though. 
ERIN: The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out. Which is something to think about, I think. 
ERIN: The tea in Nepal is very hot. 
ERIN: The tea in Nepal is very hot. 
ERIN: The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen "The Shining", "Rosemary's Baby", "The Ring". Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything. 
ERIN: Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail. 
ERIN: There s a call for you on line one. 
ERIN: There you go.  Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date. 
ERIN: There's a "Shrek" two?! 
ERIN: There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say "Delivered." Should I delete all of those? 
ERIN: There's a dog in the car. 
ERIN: There's about 30 news alerts for "Nip Slip." 
ERIN: There's nothing in it. 
ERIN: These are amazing. You took all these? 
ERIN: These are messages from clients who want to buy paper. 
ERIN: They had sex? 
ERIN: They said the both of you. 
ERIN: They want you to pay for it. 
ERIN: They're back! 
ERIN: This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in. 
ERIN: This fax came for you.  
ERIN: This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job. 
ERIN: This is a tanned spot. 
ERIN: This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married. 
ERIN: This is all I could find. 
ERIN: This is awesome.  Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup.  Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise. 
ERIN: This isn t one of those times. It s the police. They said it s the worst they ve ever seen. 
ERIN: Those posters used to be real French ads. 
ERIN: Thursday? 
ERIN: To be washed. 
ERIN: To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone? 
ERIN: Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff? 
ERIN: Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar?  
ERIN: Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein? 
ERIN: Tuh. 
ERIN: Two dates? Three dates? 
ERIN: Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples. 
ERIN: Ugh. 
ERIN: Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don t want to leave yet. I haven t had so much fun since seeing  zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun. 
ERIN: Uh! 
ERIN: Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it. 
ERIN: Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash. 
ERIN: Uh, Jim, you re not dressed up at all. 
ERIN: Uh, no.  Wait, yes. 
ERIN: Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn. 
ERIN: Uh, yeah I do remember.  Aw, they love each other. 
ERIN: Uh... 
ERIN: Uh... 
ERIN: Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so... 
ERIN: Uhhhh, they were engaged? 
ERIN: Uh-oh!  
ERIN: Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three! 
ERIN: Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
ERIN: Ukulele's happy? 
ERIN: Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you. 
ERIN: Um, D-Dog, you have a message. 
ERIN: Um, everyone was getting their driver's license. 
ERIN: Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died.  
ERIN: Um, stimulate the nipples. 
ERIN: Um,. it s empty. 
ERIN: Unplanned pregnancy. 
ERIN: Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I ve been doing this thing- 
ERIN: Vos! 
ERIN: Wah!! Aggenda!! 
ERIN: Wait which one? 
ERIN: Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain. 
ERIN: Wait, why do you have to record it? 
ERIN: Wait. Why? 
ERIN: Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call. 
ERIN: Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.  
ERIN: Want some company? 
ERIN: We are closed! Come on. 
ERIN: We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self. 
ERIN: We can do anything you want. 
ERIN: We could be roommates. 
ERIN: We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl- 
ERIN: We did it. Youth task force forever. 
ERIN: We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him. 
ERIN: We have our decision. 
ERIN: We should all go to the hospital and visit her. 
ERIN: We should do something. 
ERIN: We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense. 
ERIN: We want to dance with you. 
ERIN: Welcome back, "Dad!" 
ERIN: Well I only want to talk about work right now. 
ERIN: Well no, they're from clients. 
ERIN: Well that's a sales desk. 
ERIN: Well, Andy, I'm not coming back. 
ERIN: Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds. 
ERIN: Well, everyone got one. 
ERIN: Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's- 
ERIN: Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss. 
ERIN: Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked. 
ERIN: Well, how about Thursday? 
ERIN: Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army. 
ERIN: Well, I like to swim. 
ERIN: Well, I saw them in there. 
ERIN: Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor. 
ERIN: Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze- 
ERIN: Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for  slave master ,  attafrauk! , is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed? 
ERIN: Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space. 
ERIN: Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time. 
ERIN: Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad. 
ERIN: Well, it s addressed to Customer Service so, it s your mail. 
ERIN: Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely. 
ERIN: Well, that's not my personality. 
ERIN: Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer. 
ERIN: Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida.  
ERIN: Well, um, you know maybe you re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just-- 
ERIN: Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later. 
ERIN: Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack. 
ERIN: Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat. 
ERIN: Well, when does the boat leave, exactly? 
ERIN: Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay. 
ERIN: Well. 
ERIN: Well... 
ERIN: Well... 
ERIN: Well...  
ERIN: We're gonna watch "Wall-e", where all the boundaries of color are pushed. 
ERIN: We're pin twins. 
ERIN: West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River   
ERIN: We've already rescheduled seven times. 
ERIN: What about Kelly? 
ERIN: What are you thinking? 
ERIN: What do you think happened? 
ERIN: What do you think is on it? 
ERIN: What do you think? 
ERIN: What do you-! 
ERIN: What do you... 
ERIN: What does that one do? 
ERIN: What else you got? 
ERIN: What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you? 
ERIN: What is it? 
ERIN: What is it? I didn't sleep well last night.  
ERIN: What is that supposed to mean? 
ERIN: What is the most romantic possible thing? 
ERIN: What is with these turkeys? 
ERIN: What s wrong? 
ERIN: What was the case? 
ERIN: What we said to do. 
ERIN: What were you thinking?  
ERIN: What you doing? 
ERIN: What, do you two know each other? 
ERIN: What? 
ERIN: What? 
ERIN: What? 
ERIN: What?  
ERIN: What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it s in order? I  haven t been trained for this. 
ERIN: What? Why are we- 
ERIN: What's America gonna do? 
ERIN: What's the longest thing you've ever seen?  For me it was the tale from Jets. 
ERIN: What's this game? 
ERIN: When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this. 
ERIN: When I win... 
ERIN: When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day. 
ERIN: When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it. 
ERIN: When you lost the manager job- 
ERIN: Where did he go, Holly? 
ERIN: Whew. 
ERIN: Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess. 
ERIN: Who are you?! I don't know you!  
ERIN: Who did? 
ERIN: Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together? 
ERIN: Who is he?  
ERIN: Who s calling? 
ERIN: Who says none of us are diarrheal? 
ERIN: Who should I say is calling? 
ERIN: Whoa. the lights are still on. 
ERIN: Whoo! 
ERIN: Whoo! 
ERIN: Whoo! 
ERIN: Whoo!  Thank you. 
ERIN: Whoo! Jiminy Christmas! 
ERIN: Who's hungry? 
ERIN: Who's the guy who invented the peanut? 
ERIN: Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want. 
ERIN: Why don't you like him? 
ERIN: Why was she in this building? 
ERIN: Why would I hide it!  
ERIN: Why would I keep you from coming? 
ERIN: Why wouldn't he tell me that? 
ERIN: Why? 
ERIN: Why?

ERIN: Wow. 
ERIN: Wow. 
ERIN: Wow. 
ERIN: Wow. 
ERIN: Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order.  
ERIN: Wow. He got to purple. 
ERIN: Wow. I m so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. I ll see you guys. 
ERIN: Wow. That guy s really into paper.

ERIN: Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink! 
ERIN: Yeah! OK! Let's go. 
ERIN: Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday.  Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies. 
ERIN: Yeah, have some more blanket. 
ERIN: Yeah, he is! 
ERIN: Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that? 
ERIN: Yeah, I m alternating.  
ERIN: Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away. 
ERIN: Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there.  Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?! 
ERIN: Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven. 
ERIN: Yeah, my boudoir's always open. 
ERIN: Yeah, ok, good. 
ERIN: Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but... 
ERIN: Yeah, seriously, it s like everything on there is work. 
ERIN: Yeah, you know, like  guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh  guh. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check.  Oh, don't write it down unless you like it. 
ERIN: Yeah. Did you not see it?  
ERIN: Yeah. I basically wish you were dead.  I hid the leads. 
ERIN: Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby. 
ERIN: Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something? 
ERIN: Yeah. It s old.  
ERIN: Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan. 
ERIN: Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too.  
ERIN: Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired. 
ERIN: Yeah... 
ERIN: Yes! 
ERIN: Yes!  
ERIN: Yes!  
ERIN: Yes!  
ERIN: Yes, but I'm terrible at math so... 
ERIN: Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic. 
ERIN: Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos. 
ERIN: Yes, of course. 
ERIN: Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart. 
ERIN: Yes, there s Andy! Andy is in. I m a good receptionist, I know he s in. 
ERIN: Yes, this is too tan. This right here- 
ERIN: Yes. 
ERIN: Yes. 
ERIN: Yes. 
ERIN: Yes. 
ERIN: Yes. 
ERIN: Yes.  
ERIN: Yes. Do you have a day in mind? 
ERIN: Yes. Erin and 
ERIN: Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me! 
ERIN: Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick. 
ERIN: Yes. So do I. 
ERIN: Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here. 
ERIN: Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk. 
ERIN: Yes? 
ERIN: Yes? 
ERIN: Yes? 
ERIN: Yes? 
ERIN: Yes? Is there a follow-up question?  Mom?  
ERIN: You and Michael are always the life of the party! 
ERIN: You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be. 
ERIN: You can actually stop. 
ERIN: You can't be in here. This is a lady's room! 
ERIN: You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies? 
ERIN: You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it! 
ERIN: You didn't even stop to pee? Gross. 
ERIN: You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out. 
ERIN: You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says "free play." 
ERIN: You got really sunburned. 
ERIN: You have a cool place to come hang. 
ERIN: You have a very important call. 
ERIN: You have to change the channel to PBS. 
ERIN: You in the boss's chair! 
ERIN: You knew. 
ERIN: You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go? 
ERIN: You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager. 
ERIN: You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That s what happened. The pens happened. 
ERIN: You left us without saying goodbye. 
ERIN: You listen to me. You are not to tell me what to do. 
ERIN: You look like J-Lo. 
ERIN: You mean more like dangerous curves... 
ERIN: You mean, put me on the news? 
ERIN: You named them? 
ERIN: You promised! 
ERIN: You re not going to get it though? 
ERIN: You re not going to take it? 
ERIN: You re not married yet? Old 
ERIN: You read the fax. 
ERIN: You really think we can get that back? 
ERIN: You should move down here with me. 
ERIN: You tricked me! 
ERIN: You want to keep this? 
ERIN: You want to talk to me, come to my desk. 
ERIN: Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule. 
ERIN: Your first student is here, Mister Bernard. 
ERIN: Your hand's cold. 
ERIN: Your two o'clock.  
ERIN: You're a real crumb bum, you know that? 
ERIN: You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid. 
ERIN: You're bad.   Vance Refrigeration Guy 
ERIN: You're going to be alright 
ERIN: You're soaking wet. 
ERIN: You're up. 
ERNESTO:  Where you want I park?

ESTHER: Dwight, we need to talk. 
ESTHER: Go get  em, honey. 
ESTHER: Hey. 
ESTHER: Hi Dwight. 
ESTHER: Hmm. That is sad. Carla 
ESTHER: Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends. 
ESTHER: Mmhm. 
ESTHER: Of course.  You didn't just think I was tractor bait, did you? 
ESTHER: Oh! I m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue. 
ESTHER: Oh. Is she a gambler? 
ESTHER: So you're going to be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles and he's pocketing a profit behind your back. 
ESTHER: Stupid. 
ESTHER: Thank you.  
ESTHER: This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn. 
ESTHER: We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely.  
ESTHER: Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow. 
ESTHER: You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine. 
EVAN: Are we early? 
EVAN: Do you guys work together? 
EVAN: Great. 
EVAN: Hey, uh... Arnie Reisman. Michael, Jim.

FACT: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing. 
FACT: I love grape soda. I always have. 
FACT: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets. 
FACT: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda. 
FACT: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim. 
FAMILY: Hello, hi. 
FANNIE:  I see you started without me. 
FANNIE:  So, I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then, if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks.  Todd 
FANNIE: All right. 
FANNIE: By the way, that's not... 
FANNIE: Hey. 
FANNIE: Is she crazy?  Dwight? 
FANNIE: Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication. 
FANNIE: No, no, no. 
FANNIE: No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy? 
FANNIE: Not it. 
FANNIE: Oh my goodness. 
FANNIE: Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this. 
FANNIE: That Cammy and I are drawn to. And, I don't know. The men are just... it's almost like there's a... a willing ignorance. 
FANNIE: That doesn't work on me. 
FANNIE: Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt. 
FANNIE: Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui. 
FANNIE: Well, I told you... 
FANNIE: We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here. 
FANNIE: Yes. I, thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And, I was recently published. Which is just...  maybe I have. Yep. I do. Here it is from the um, Hartford Women's Lit Quarterly.com. A Willing Ignorance by Fannie Schrute. 
FATHER:  I can t relate to that, my son hates my guts. 
FATHER:  It s kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store. 
FATHER: Ahh  
FATHER: Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that? 
FATHER: Here he is, my son. 
FATHER: How long have you been married to the cheerleader? 
FATHER: I d love to! Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kind of pushed me out, truth be told. I m just here for human contract. Suit Store 
FATHER: I heard that before  
FATHER: Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight? 
FATHER: Listen to him. He created you. 
FATHER: Really shameful  
FATHER: Sons used to idolize their fathers. 
FATHER: Yes. 
FATHER: You don t meet many hunters these days. 
FAUST: Whose parking spaces? 
FERN:  Andy! If you don't stick your eyes in that machine, I'm going to call every production in North Eastern Pennsylvania. You won't even make an appearance on a security camera!

FOUR: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point- 
FRANK:  Lady! My truck? You had no right! Pam:No, you had no right! 
FRANK: I'm sorry I didn't like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny. 
FRANK: It's a $40,000 truck! 
FRANK: So? So someone need to shut you up!  
FRANK: Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours. 
FRANK: You know what? You people can't fire me. So, screw you.  
FRANK: You son of a bitch! 
FRANK: You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there.  
FRANKLIN: Ah. I'm here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the founding fathers. 
FRANKLIN: Both. That's why I invented the bifocal. 
FRANKLIN: But I kept all this from my wife Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler sex. 
FRANKLIN: Chocolate! Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States. 
FRANKLIN: Fredrick Wilhelm the 3rd. 
FRANKLIN: Hello! 
FRANKLIN: Hold the door please! 
FRANKLIN: I have a lovely wife, Deborah.

FRANKLIN: Joseph the 2nd. 
FRANKLIN: Knickers in fact, yes! 
FRANKLIN: Thank you for that introduction, Mr. Scott, and good afternoon fine gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin. 
FRANKLIN: Thank you. 
FRANKLIN: Uh, well that is a grey area of my life. Okay? So, it was a warm June evening. 
FRANKLIN: Well I'm sensing a little electricity right here. 
FRANKLIN: Well, actually, I never was president. 
FRANKLIN: Well, that is because I am a renaissance man. 
FRANKLIN: Well, you're very saucy!  
FRANKLIN: What? 
FRANKLIN: Why the tyrant King George, of course! 
FRANKLIN: Yes, but I don't. My name is Gordon. 
FRANKLIN: Yes? 
FRANKLIN: You know I invented electricity. 
FRANKLIN: You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son. 
FRED:  Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right? 
FRED: Color-code sent documents, TM. 
FRED: I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that? 
FRED: Nice try. 
FRED: No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of...  Vance Refrigeration. 
FRED: Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part. 
FRED: That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement. 
FRED: Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan. 
FRED: Yeah. 
FRIEND:  Boom! ADHD! 
FRIEND: My ex-girlfriend. She's right behind you. Just... hide me. 
FRIEND: No no! Don't look!   
FRIEND: Oh, my God. Ok. Everybody just act normal. Don't say anything. 
FRIEND: Sorry. 
FRIEND: Uh, actually, kind of. Yes. I just didn't like eating dinner that early.   
FRIEND: Whoo! 
FRIEND: Yes! 
GABE/KELLY/TOBY:  Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew. 
GABE:  Ah! Ha ha ha! 
GABE:  Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation? 
GABE:  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so... 
GABE:  Gotta catch a plane. 
GABE:  Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him? 
GABE:  Guys, to err is human.  
GABE:  Guys? 
GABE:  Happy birthday to Gabe! 
GABE:  Hey. You're welcome. 
GABE:  I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just... like it's coming from my own head. 
GABE:  I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits. 
GABE:  I live in this room. 
GABE:  I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000.  We've investigated. Every time it's been user error. They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that.  That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts.  
GABE:  I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed. 
GABE:  In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face...  we will be reviewing our sales policies.  I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up. 
GABE:  It's a little loud... 
GABE:  Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out. 
GABE: - of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael. 
GABE:  Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out. 
GABE:  Oh that would be scary! 
GABE:  Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time. 
GABE:  So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough. 
GABE:  Some of us are trying to have a conversation. 
GABE:  Stay away from Erin!  
GABE:  That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that. 
GABE:  Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential. 
GABE:  Total brain burp. 
GABE:  Walk away bitch. 
GABE:  Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life. 
GABE:  Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about.  Alright I'm gonna go.  
GABE:  Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret. 
GABE:  What happened? 
GABE:  You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right.  
GABE:  You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao.  
GABE: "Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat."  
GABE: "Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her." 
GABE: "I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull.  "Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo." 
GABE: "Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe." 
GABE: "Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.' 
GABE: ...a lot of the time. 
GABE: ...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations. 
GABE: 320. Just freeballin' it. 
GABE: A little un-specific. 
GABE: Abe and Mary are seated watching the show.  Oh Mary this is wonderful  Ok Mary stop your scolding. I ll be quiet.  I need her like I need a hole in the head!   BANG! Ooh  
GABE: Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites. And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well. 
GABE: Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening. 
GABE: All right. 
GABE: All right. Uh, Stan, you're up. 
GABE: Alright. 
GABE: And Gabe-y makes three. 
GABE: And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do. 
GABE: And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like. 
GABE: And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao. 
GABE: And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another- 
GABE: And what do we have here? 
GABE: And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors. 
GABE: Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it. Chelsea's 
GABE: Are you still in love with Erin? 
GABE: At all. 
GABE: At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your - 
GABE: Beautiful sentiment. 
GABE: Because I am. I need to get her back.  I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now? 
GABE: But you do. You are in charge - 
GABE: Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking. 
GABE: Can I buy everyone coffees?   "Or cookies." 
GABE: Can I talk to you a second about these client memos? 
GABE: Can you at least try to look busy?  
GABE: Can you two please join me in my office? Now. 
GABE: CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes. 
GABE: Come on. 
GABE: Core s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One   lengthen. Two   elongate. 
GABE: Corporate says to me,  Gabe, we need you in Scranton.  Scranton says,  Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.  So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying. 
GABE: Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I'm in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn't get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems. 
GABE: Course I know. 
GABE: Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview. 
GABE: Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone. 
GABE: Decaf frap- 
GABE: Did someone say girl talk? 
GABE: Do you promise that? 
GABE: Droswip, yeah. I get it. Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom. 
GABE: Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush!  Ow! 
GABE: Dwight? What are you doing here? 
GABE: Erin and I make great use of ours. 
GABE: Erin you don't have to... 
GABE: Erin, are you even hearing this? 
GABE: Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God.  
GABE: Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night. 
GABE: Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor.  All right. 
GABE: Everyone, our very own Angela- 
GABE: First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here. 
GABE: First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances. 
GABE: Five. Six. 
GABE: Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.' 
GABE: Gabe Lewis. 
GABE: Give me one night with you... 
GABE: Give or take.  
GABE: Go get 'em. Start quipin'. 
GABE: Good morning.  
GABE: Good. 
GABE: Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics. 
GABE: Good. Well, that's the spirit. 
GABE: Got it. 
GABE: Great!  Um, can we just...  
GABE: Great. 
GABE: Great. 
GABE: Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology. 
GABE: Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV? 
GABE: Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines. 
GABE: Hello beautiful. 
GABE: Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around. 
GABE: Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val  
GABE: Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important.  It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension. 
GABE: Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got- 
GABE: Hey! Watch it. 
GABE: Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again? 
GABE: Hey, Andy? 
GABE: Hey, guys. 
GABE: Hey, guys. 
GABE: Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people? 
GABE: Hey. 
GABE: Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship. 
GABE: Hey... 
GABE: Hmm? 
GABE: Honestly, it was a little weird. 
GABE: Hope I'm not interrupting anything. 
GABE: How many windows are there in New York City? 
GABE: How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability.  
GABE: How much? 
GABE: How would we know that, if you don't... 
GABE: How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR? 
GABE: I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues] 
GABE: I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way. 
GABE: I can see you in the jungle now. 
GABE: I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch? 
GABE: I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress? 
GABE: I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane. 
GABE: I could quit. Problem solved. 
GABE: I didn't know Darryl joined. 
GABE: I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science. 
GABE: I don't - it's just... 
GABE: I don't know. All I know is the building. 
GABE: I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah. 
GABE: I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton. 
GABE: I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad. 
GABE: I don't want to hear it. Suspended. 
GABE: I don't want to say it. 
GABE: I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam. 
GABE: I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard.  
GABE: I got a tattoo for you. 
GABE: I have no idea. 
GABE: I have shaved everything... 
GABE: I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office! 
GABE: I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that. 
GABE: I know, right? 
GABE: I know. 
GABE: I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right. 
GABE: I love the burn. The burn is where I live. 
GABE: I need to talk to you! 
GABE: I picked out our movie. It's called "Suspiria". It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down. 
GABE: I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They d flex them all night at the discotheque. 
GABE: I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue. 
GABE: I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite. 
GABE: I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship- 
GABE: I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle. 
GABE: I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other. 
GABE: I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine. 
GABE: I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,... 
GABE: I'll just turn the captions on. 
GABE: I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you. 
GABE: I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem. 
GABE: I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half. 
GABE: I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao.  
GABE: I'm gonna keep trying Jo. 
GABE: I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen. 
GABE: I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party. 
GABE: I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So.. 
GABE: I'm sorry. This can't wait. 
GABE: I'm such a klutz! 
GABE: I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on.  Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way? 
GABE: I'm your boss! 
GABE: In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me. 
GABE: Intercepted! 
GABE: Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love? 
GABE: It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some "Slumdog Millionaire" scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible. 
GABE: It s one of the most common fetishes. 
GABE: It's awful.  
GABE: It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous. 
GABE: It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way. 
GABE: It's still on upstairs. 
GABE: It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened. 
GABE: I've got just the thing!  This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon.  
GABE: I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help. 
GABE: Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing. 
GABE: Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one.  
GABE: Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets. 
GABE: Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst. You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling. 
GABE: Let's go ahead and wash our hands. 
GABE: Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ? 
GABE: Look at this, this is enormous. 
GABE: Maybe you find your own chair. 
GABE: Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be. 
GABE: Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff - 
GABE: Michael, this is irresponsible. 
GABE: Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private? 
GABE: Mm-hmm. 
GABE: Monday's suck. 
GABE: More tasteless than this..."is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it."  
GABE: Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper. 
GABE: My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to 
GABE: My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just-- keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room. 
GABE: Nice guy. 
GABE: Nice pelvic bowl. Deep. 
GABE: No no. No no no. 
GABE: No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. 
GABE: No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever. 
GABE: No! You go away!  
GABE: No, I was not. 
GABE: No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies! 
GABE: No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying. 
GABE: No, no, I'm- 
GABE: No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs. 
GABE: No.  
GABE: No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her? 
GABE: No... How far away is the Sun? 
GABE: Nope. 
GABE: Not here. 
GABE: Nudity makes me uncomfortable. 
GABE: Number 
GABE: Number 
GABE: Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for. 
GABE: Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate? 
GABE: Oh my God, I can't look at roaches. 
GABE: Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe. 
GABE: Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck. 
GABE: Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive. 
GABE: Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager. 
GABE: Oh, how the mediocre have fallen. 
GABE: Oh, I am so in. 
GABE: Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so... 
GABE: Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair- 
GABE: Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was... 
GABE: Oh, this is "Print in All Colors," Sabre's minority executive training program. 
GABE: Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so-  Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny.  
GABE: Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch. 
GABE: Oh. Okay. And to you.  
GABE: Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking? 
GABE: Ohh. Dropping bombs, right?  This really make you think, Michael? 
GABE: Ok final thing, and this is a fun 
GABE: Ok let me go get it. 
GABE: Ok where does Gabe factor in? 
GABE: Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know? 
GABE: Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment. 
GABE: Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down. 
GABE: Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have  really been proud of the way... Okay, um... 
GABE: Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle. 
GABE: Ok. 
GABE: Ok.  No no no. 
GABE: Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days. 
GABE: Okay, good. 
GABE: Okay, guys, fun is fun, but- 
GABE: Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position.  Do you, um, do you think that you are? 
GABE: Okay, Quick. 
GABE: Okay, that's not gonna be... 
GABE: Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open. 
GABE: Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco. 
GABE: Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo. 
GABE: Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound. 
GABE: Okay. 
GABE: Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh... 
GABE: Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else. 
GABE: Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period. 
GABE: Okay... 
GABE: Okay...  
GABE: Ooh. 
GABE: Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard.  Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief  I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum  out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail? 
GABE: Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton. 
GABE: Ow! He went home. 
GABE: Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help! 
GABE: Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit... 
GABE: Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan? 
GABE: Right, of course! 
GABE: See ya Oscar!  
GABE: Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace. 
GABE: Shove his sashimi! 
GABE: Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN!  
GABE: So I got us a compromise. This movie's called "Hardware". It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married... 
GABE: So leave. Deleted Scene 1 
GABE: So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and... 
GABE: So what, no one's even gonna try? 
GABE: So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation? 
GABE: So, I won. 
GABE: So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me. 
GABE: Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room. 
GABE: Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk. 
GABE: Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. 
GABE: Speed set. One. Two. 
GABE: Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment. 
GABE: Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood.  Not every day. 
GABE: Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem. 
GABE: Sweetheart. 
GABE: Tasteless? 
GABE: Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice. 
GABE: Thank you so much. 
GABE: That is correct. Todd 
GABE: That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office. 
GABE: That is not how it seems to me. 
GABE: That sounds like a promotion! 
GABE: That'd be hilarious. Uh, "Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop 'em." 
GABE: That's for the other box. 
GABE: That's very nice.  I never noticed that before. 
GABE: That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves. 
GABE: The alternative is termination.  
GABE: The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure. 
GABE: The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement. The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea. 
GABE: The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back. 
GABE: The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator. 
GABE: The puzzle is the clue. 
GABE: The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients- 
GABE: There are plenty of people who love touching me.  I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon. 
GABE: There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right? 
GABE: They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore! 
GABE: They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife. 
GABE: They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right. 
GABE: This is Accounting. 
GABE: This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on. 
GABE: This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch. 
GABE: This is violent and offensive. 
GABE: This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up. 
GABE: Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities. 
GABE: Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable. 
GABE: To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you... 
GABE: Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight. 
GABE: Too kind doesn't begin to cover it. 
GABE: Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter. 
GABE: Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat. 
GABE: Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to  screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned.  
GABE: Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming? 
GABE: Uh, I think you re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah.  It ll be upsetting if you don t. 
GABE: Uh, it was. 
GABE: Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing. 
GABE: Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels? 
GABE: Uh, not now. 
GABE: Uh. 
GABE: Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website.  
GABE: Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions. 
GABE: Um. I set my stuff up in there. So... just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you. 
GABE: Umm, Pam? 
GABE: Umm... "You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here." Ha. 
GABE: Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed. 
GABE: Very unprofessional, "Jacques." Or, should I say, Dwight. 
GABE: Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?'  no, no, no, no  
GABE: Was it Pam? 
GABE: We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that. 
GABE: We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger. 
GABE: We got it? 
GABE: We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks. 
GABE: We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so...  
GABE: We just want to say how grateful we are. 
GABE: Well he s probably a drug dealer. That s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow. 
GABE: Well, get to work. 
GABE: Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know? 
GABE: Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf. 
GABE: Well, Jo-- 
GABE: Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch "Wall-e". 
GABE: Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself. 
GABE: Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis. 
GABE: Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job. 
GABE: Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide. 
GABE: Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales. 
GABE: Well... 
GABE: Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan. 
GABE: Well... it's just...  it messes up my rhythm. 
GABE: What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it.  
GABE: What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England.  Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay.  Um, what are your weaknesses? 
GABE: What happens if you're the hunchback? 
GABE: What kind of music are you into, Peter? 
GABE: What recommendation? 
GABE: What? 
GABE: What? 
GABE: What? 
GABE: What's in it for GSL? 
GABE: When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales. 
GABE: When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean? 
GABE: Which ones? 
GABE: Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby. 
GABE: Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse. 
GABE: Whoops. 
GABE: Why do you keep repeating -  
GABE: Why don't we say ciao to the impressions?  
GABE: Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis? 
GABE: Will you marry me? 
GABE: Yay Robert! 
GABE: Yeah it seems like there isn t a narrative.  Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting. 
GABE: Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays  
GABE: Yeah, booby honking. Sure. 
GABE: Yeah, but she's not white, though. 
GABE: Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies. 
GABE: Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right? I will date when I'm dead!  
GABE: Yeah, unless somebody else applies today. 
GABE: Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim.  Ok fine. You too Dwight. 
GABE: Yeah. 
GABE: Yeah. 
GABE: Yeah. 
GABE: Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. 
GABE: Yeah. He told me you two broke up. 
GABE: Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means? 
GABE: Yep! Waste not right? 
GABE: Yep. 
GABE: Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating? 
GABE: Yes, I am. 
GABE: Yes, it is. 
GABE: Yes. For Gabe. 
GABE: Yes. Lars and Decocco s 
GABE: Yes? 
GABE: Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy. 
GABE: You don't really toss the dough. 
GABE: You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang. 
GABE: You had something important to tell me? 
GABE: You have some food on your face. 
GABE: You have to be a minority. 
GABE: You have to cut it out. 
GABE: You know what? Let me see what I can do. 
GABE: You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin. 
GABE: You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior. 
GABE: You must be pretty horny.  
GABE: You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days. 
GABE: You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities. 
GABE: Your wish is my command. 
GABE: You're doing great. You know, so good.

GIRL: Is he OK? 
GIRL: Is this the party?   
GIRL: It's gonna be three months of hard work and when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos. 
GIRL: My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldn't hesitate to save a family member from a burning building, but what if the earth was your building and all the people on it were your family? 
GIRL: Oh, that's gross. 
GIRL: Right now, Jessica's children have to walk twelve miles to a school with dirt floors. 
GIRL: Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your  thin  girlfriend. 
GIRL: Sorry, it's the other thing I do when I get really nervous. 
GIRL: Sure. 
GIRL: Thank you. Or should I say gracias?

GIRL: Um, a hat. 
GIRL: Well, ok... bags!   Alright, that was bad. 
GIRL: What? 
GIRL: Whew, I'm really nervous. 
GIRL: Whew, it's better for me just to be quiet, yeah. 
GIRL: Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter? 
GIRL: Yeah, when I get nervous I sort of clam up. 
GIRL: Yesterday? 
GIRL: You have plenty left to give. You're doing- 
GIRL: You're cute. 
GIRLFRIEND: I'm gonna get a drink. Do you need anything? 
GIRLFRIEND: Okay. 
GIRLS:  Kelly Zach Braff

GROTTI: God forbid you... should have a fire in the warehouse. 
GROTTI: Hi. Angelo Grotti.

GROTTI: I can be very very persistent. 
GROTTI: I don't get it. How was I scaring you? 
GROTTI: I, I thought you'd be pleased. 
GROTTI: If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy. 
GROTTI: I'm sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down. 
GROTTI: Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you. 
GROTTI: Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow? 
GROTTI: Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give me a call? 
GROTTI: Mr. Scott. 
GROTTI: None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss. 
GROTTI: Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion.  You okay, Pat? 
GROTTI: Oh! Great. Michael, I'm finishing up your paperwork right now. 
GROTTI: So, you got this table?

GROTTI: Where were we? 
GROTTI: Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh? 
GROTTI: Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there's injury. 
GROTTI: Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back. 
GROTTI: You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott.

GUY:  It's actually not super-complicated. I mean I'm sure there's some sort of like, adult education classes in the area. But if you're really serious about graphic design, one thing about New York or Philadelphia, they've got amazing programs out there for design.

GUY: Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices? 
GUY: Why? 
GUY: Wow. 
GUY: Yeah, I know that guy. He's that farmer that grows really crappy weed. 
GUY: Yeah, what kind of video? 
GUY: Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct. 
GUY: Yeah. 
GUY: You banged her? 
GUY: You better think about what you're doing. 
GUY: You know generally it's not a good idea to click on offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer?

HELENE: Oh, I know. I love how they use butter cream frosting. 
HELENE: Oh, Michael what do you think? Grandma? 
HELENE: Oh, oh no. I don't think so. 
HELENE: Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma. 
HELENE: Ok, there's a penny. What's that from? 
HELENE: Ooh, somebody has a full diaper. 
HELENE: So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales? 
HELENE: Tell her how you gave it to me. 
HELENE: Thank you.  
HELENE: Uh huh. 
HELENE: Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene. 
HELENE: Wait a minute.  Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace. 
HELENE: Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to? 
HELENE: Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee. 
HELENE: Well, thank you. All of you. 
HELENE: Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales. 
HELENE: What did you think we were? 
HELENE: You want to go snowboarding? 
HELENE: You're lucky to be alive. 
HENRY: Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits. 
HENRY: Anyone mention her height? 
HENRY: Dwight. 
HENRY: Land size?   Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's.  OK.  
HERE: Michael handles more of the "big-picture" stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together... 
HERE: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler 
HERE: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked. 
HIDE: Bad economy. Bad investment. 
HIDE: Coconut penis.

HIDE: Why? I don't need translator. 
HIDE: You paint now.

HOLLY: 
HOLLY:   Delivery 
HOLLY:   Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it! 
HOLLY:   How did you know that?! 
HOLLY:   It's time to go. 
HOLLY:   Nice campus. Think you'll get in? 
HOLLY:   No more. 
HOLLY:   No, he didn't. 
HOLLY:   Oh, I forgot my keys. 
HOLLY:   Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight. 
HOLLY:   Okay. So good to see you. 
HOLLY:   Sorry. 
HOLLY:   Thank you. 
HOLLY:   We could do Back to the Future. 
HOLLY:  Acting! 
HOLLY:  Bummer. 
HOLLY:  Damn it! 
HOLLY:  Ha ha, ha ha! 
HOLLY:  Hello there! 
HOLLY:  Hello. 
HOLLY:  Hi guys. 
HOLLY:  Hi! 
HOLLY:  Holly misses old phone. 
HOLLY:  I can't wait. 
HOLLY:  I most certainly am. 
HOLLY:  I'll pay the rent!  Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom! 
HOLLY:  It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat. 
HOLLY:  Lovitz. 
HOLLY:  Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves. 
HOLLY:  Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know. 
HOLLY:  Michael? 
HOLLY:  New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception. 
HOLLY:  Oh you mean this? 
HOLLY:  Oh, Homey.  
HOLLY:  Oh, huggy monster! 
HOLLY:  Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right. 
HOLLY:  Pass curvy metal piece, you will. 
HOLLY:  Reese's Pieces? 
HOLLY:  This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up.  
HOLLY:  This is Holly. 
HOLLY:  Very funny. Okay let's get started. 
HOLLY:  Watch out for my guns they're both loaded.  
HOLLY:  Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard. 
HOLLY:  What did you do to him? 
HOLLY:  Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving. 
HOLLY:  Wonderful seminar! 
HOLLY:  You ahh. 
HOLLY: "...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate. Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies. As was clearly stated in the official starting---" 
HOLLY: ...Hell yeah. 
HOLLY: 10 dollars. 
HOLLY: 13 dollars. 
HOLLY: 20. 
HOLLY: A chastity belt. 
HOLLY: A little lower. 
HOLLY: A lot of people. 
HOLLY: Actually, I'm a lesbian. 
HOLLY: Ahh! 
HOLLY: Ahoy. 
HOLLY: AJ gave me that. 
HOLLY: All right. 
HOLLY: All right. 
HOLLY: Almost got you. 
HOLLY: Almost, Kevin. 
HOLLY: And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head.   
HOLLY: And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym. 
HOLLY: And here. 
HOLLY: And I like you too. 
HOLLY: And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend.. 
HOLLY: And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you.. 
HOLLY: And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again. 
HOLLY: And you know what? I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise. Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call? 
HOLLY: Are their egg rolls really that big? 
HOLLY: Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire? 
HOLLY: Aww man, I really wanted to see them. 
HOLLY: Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay? 
HOLLY: Breaker one-nine, copy? 
HOLLY: Bye. 
HOLLY: Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you. 
HOLLY: Can I have everyone's attention? Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please. We need to finish the ethics seminar. 
HOLLY: Can I sit? 
HOLLY: Can I talk to you for a second? 
HOLLY: Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong? 
HOLLY: Cool! You drive your own car? 
HOLLY: Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement. 
HOLLY: Crystal cool. 
HOLLY: Did Todd tell you to do that? 
HOLLY: Dieting's only half of it. 
HOLLY: Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done? 
HOLLY: Do you have a script for the sketch, or... 
HOLLY: Do you need some help? 
HOLLY: Don't you have a sales call to go on? 
HOLLY: Dunder Mifflin. 
HOLLY: Dun-der. Dun-der... 
HOLLY: Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends. 
HOLLY: Eight point five. I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt. But he's cute, right? 
HOLLY: Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training. 
HOLLY: Ex-squeeze me. 
HOLLY: For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth? 
HOLLY: For what? 
HOLLY: Get a life! 
HOLLY: Give me all your money and take off your clothes. 
HOLLY: Good. 
HOLLY: Great. 
HOLLY: He had a little note pinned to him that said, "You've got a friend in me." 
HOLLY: He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here. 
HOLLY: He is not an idiot! 
HOLLY: He knows how to get things. He got me. 
HOLLY: Hello. 
HOLLY: Hello. 
HOLLY: Hello. Hello.  Hi. 
HOLLY: Here you go. 
HOLLY: Hey Kevin. 
HOLLY: Hey there. 
HOLLY: Hey! Good movie. 
HOLLY: Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight. 
HOLLY: Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected. 
HOLLY: Hey, I'm sorry. It is good. 
HOLLY: Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet? 
HOLLY: Hey, what's up guys? 
HOLLY: Hey. 
HOLLY: Hi Dad. Holly's 
HOLLY: Hi. 
HOLLY: Hi. 
HOLLY: Hi. 
HOLLY: Hi. 
HOLLY: Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson? 
HOLLY: Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend? 
HOLLY: Hindsight. 
HOLLY: Hmm. Well how much money do you have there?  Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row. 
HOLLY: Hmm... 
HOLLY: Honey, he's a jerk. 
HOLLY: How do you know when its time? 
HOLLY: How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing? 
HOLLY: How long could we keep that up? 
HOLLY: How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk. 
HOLLY: How's she doing? 
HOLLY: I already have. 
HOLLY: I am calling because, there's a terrible crash! 
HOLLY: I am? 
HOLLY: I can imagine. 
HOLLY: I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head. 
HOLLY: I can't wait. 
HOLLY: I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us? 
HOLLY: I didn't know you had a girlfriend. 
HOLLY: I do, I think so. 
HOLLY: I don't care, free tonight. 
HOLLY: I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory. 
HOLLY: I don't know. 
HOLLY: I don't know. 
HOLLY: I don't know. 
HOLLY: I don't think he's funnier than me. 
HOLLY: I don't think we could enforce that. 
HOLLY: I don't think we'd have kids. 
HOLLY: I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here. 
HOLLY: I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake? 
HOLLY: I have no idea. 
HOLLY: I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets! 
HOLLY: I just got off... Kendall? I just got off... 
HOLLY: I just think we need to cool things down for awhile. Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure. 
HOLLY: I just... Um, excuse me. 
HOLLY: I knew that. OK, bye. 
HOLLY: I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael? Holly's 
HOLLY: I love pie. 
HOLLY: I love the view. 
HOLLY: I love you too. 
HOLLY: I love you too. 
HOLLY: I love you. 
HOLLY: I love you. 
HOLLY: I loved it. 
HOLLY: I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line. 
HOLLY: I missed you too. 
HOLLY: I remember your chair pants idea.   
HOLLY: I remember. 
HOLLY: I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well. 
HOLLY: I think it's really cool you hired Kevin. 
HOLLY: I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania. Holly's 
HOLLY: If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best? 
HOLLY: I'm calling it. I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy. 
HOLLY: I'm from da future. 
HOLLY: I'm going out with you. 
HOLLY: I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke. 
HOLLY: I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said. 
HOLLY: I'm real. 
HOLLY: I'm Robert Dunder. 
HOLLY: I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated. 
HOLLY: I'm sorry about your friend. 
HOLLY: I'm sorry. 
HOLLY: In Summer. 
HOLLY: In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days. Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers. Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible. 
HOLLY: Is he okay? 
HOLLY: Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian. 
HOLLY: Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please? 
HOLLY: It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine. 
HOLLY: It was blue cheese dressing. 
HOLLY: It was just for a few weeks! 
HOLLY: It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado. 
HOLLY: It would help. 
HOLLY: It'll probably be a total disaster, but... 
HOLLY: It's a pea shoot... 
HOLLY: It's been a little tense. People are suspicious of me. And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular. I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker. I was just hoping middle school was over. 
HOLLY: It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said "Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?" And he said "I asked you first." And I said "First!" at the same time he did. And then I said "Jinx." And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So... 
HOLLY: It's got you. 
HOLLY: It's kind of a good news, bad news situation. The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days. So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off. 
HOLLY: It's Mike-raculous. 
HOLLY: It's not a family. It's a workplace. 
HOLLY: It's not gonna work. 
HOLLY: It's the gas station on Benet Street? 
HOLLY: I've dated four guys last year too. 
HOLLY: Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community. 
HOLLY: Kidding. 
HOLLY: Lemonade sounds great. 
HOLLY: Let me see. 
HOLLY: Let's check there. 
HOLLY: Let's get ethical! Ethical! I wanna get ethical! Let's get into Ethics yeah! Let me hear that Dunder Mifflin talk! Your body talk. Let me hear your body talk. 
HOLLY: Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning. It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree. But ideally you would have selected totally agree. 
HOLLY: Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long. Michael, Holly, and 
HOLLY: Listen about earlier ... 
HOLLY: Look at where my seats were. 
HOLLY: Look I need to talk to you. 
HOLLY: Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him. 
HOLLY: Man, someone doesn't like H.R. 
HOLLY: Math is hard. 
HOLLY: Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus. 
HOLLY: Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance. 
HOLLY: Maybe we should talk about Meredith first. 
HOLLY: Meredith, that is serious. I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods. 
HOLLY: Mh hmm. 
HOLLY: Michael called Dad? Holly's 
HOLLY: Michael I think this is our fault. 
HOLLY: Michael is taking a personal day to move me up. 
HOLLY: Michael scored the big ticket item. Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss. 
HOLLY: Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks 
HOLLY: Michael, are you okay? 
HOLLY: Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that. 
HOLLY: Michael, I should get back to work. 
HOLLY: Michael, I'm sorry. 
HOLLY: Michael, thank you so much for saying that.  I feel so welcome here. 
HOLLY: Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith. 
HOLLY: Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up. 
HOLLY: Michael, you don't have to buy them. 
HOLLY: Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore. 
HOLLY: Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be. 
HOLLY: Michael..  
HOLLY: Michael...  
HOLLY: Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me! 
HOLLY: Mmhmm. 
HOLLY: Mm-hmm. 
HOLLY: Mm-hmm. 
HOLLY: Mmm. 
HOLLY: Mmm. Do you like movies? 
HOLLY: Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject. Holly's 
HOLLY: Next day I found him in my bed. 
HOLLY: Nice 
HOLLY: No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that. 
HOLLY: No more brain damage. 
HOLLY: No more. 
HOLLY: No this is Holly. 
HOLLY: No touching. 
HOLLY: No you don't. 
HOLLY: No! No. 
HOLLY: No! You do not talk to him like that! 
HOLLY: No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please?   
HOLLY: No, don't touch. 
HOLLY: No, he's not funny at all. 
HOLLY: No, hey. 
HOLLY: No, I don't think so. 
HOLLY: No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies. It's part of the ethics thing. 
HOLLY: No, I understand. 
HOLLY: No, it's not a formality. Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal? Unrelated to business? 
HOLLY: No, no, I... 
HOLLY: No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job. 
HOLLY: No, this is Michael Scott. 
HOLLY: No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me. 
HOLLY: No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is. 
HOLLY: No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened. 
HOLLY: No, you can have your own opinion. 
HOLLY: No. 
HOLLY: No. 
HOLLY: No. 
HOLLY: No. 
HOLLY: No. 
HOLLY: No. 
HOLLY: No. 
HOLLY: No. 
HOLLY: No. 
HOLLY: No. I can do it. 
HOLLY: No. I know. I was like, "What? Are you serious?" 
HOLLY: No. Mom? 
HOLLY: No. No... no Dad. Holly's 
HOLLY: No. Which one's Kevin?  
HOLLY: Nope. 
HOLLY: Not bad. 
HOLLY: Not worried about that. 
HOLLY: Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together. 
HOLLY: Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever. 
HOLLY: Obesity-caused illnesses. 
HOLLY: Of course. Yeah. 
HOLLY: Oh I already bought this... 
HOLLY: Oh I'm going. 
HOLLY: Oh--- no no no. 
HOLLY: Oh no no no. I'll be fine. 
HOLLY: Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here. 
HOLLY: Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it? 
HOLLY: Oh that is so sweet. 
HOLLY: Oh that would be great. 
HOLLY: Oh, after vous.   
HOLLY: Oh, fancy meeting you here. 
HOLLY: Oh, God, no. 
HOLLY: Oh, good for you. 
HOLLY: Oh, good. 
HOLLY: Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that. 
HOLLY: Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum. 
HOLLY: Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call. I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so... 
HOLLY: Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you! 
HOLLY: Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial. 
HOLLY: Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical. 
HOLLY: Oh, I think she's on a sales call. 
HOLLY: Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together. 
HOLLY: Oh, I'd like to hear the answer. 
HOLLY: Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights. 
HOLLY: Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up. 
HOLLY: Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did. 
HOLLY: Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers. 
HOLLY: Oh, it's very nice. 
HOLLY: Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go. I'll take my free stress ball too now. Cell Phone Sales 
HOLLY: Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours. 
HOLLY: Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it. 
HOLLY: Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though. 
HOLLY: Oh, no. 
HOLLY: Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable. 
HOLLY: Oh, of course you are. 
HOLLY: Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him. 
HOLLY: Oh, she's very beautiful. 
HOLLY: Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks? 
HOLLY: Oh, thanks. I should check that out. 
HOLLY: Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here. 
HOLLY: Oh, that would be great. You need that. 
HOLLY: Oh, that's our Zen garden. 
HOLLY: Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck. 
HOLLY: Oh, the mall could be fun. 
HOLLY: Oh, wow... you went together? 
HOLLY: Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them. 
HOLLY: Oh. 
HOLLY: Oh. 
HOLLY: Oh. 
HOLLY: Oh. 
HOLLY: Oh. 
HOLLY: Oh. Good for you guys. 
HOLLY: Oh... 
HOLLY: Oh... 
HOLLY: Oh...  Nice, I've never heard that one before actually. 
HOLLY: Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet. 
HOLLY: Oh... when did you get here? 
HOLLY: Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding! 
HOLLY: Ohh. Can you get lower? 
HOLLY: Ok, but we should get back to business. Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace. 
HOLLY: Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok? 
HOLLY: Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated. 
HOLLY: Ok. 
HOLLY: Ok. 
HOLLY: Ok.   Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil. That's not right. 
HOLLY: Okay, bye. Okay, bye.  I'll miss you. 
HOLLY: Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over. 
HOLLY: Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him. 
HOLLY: Okay, one more quick one. 
HOLLY: Okay, yeah. 
HOLLY: Okay. 
HOLLY: Okay. 
HOLLY: Okay. 
HOLLY: Okay. 
HOLLY: Okay. Bye. 
HOLLY: Okay. Good night. 
HOLLY: Ooh, uh... 
HOLLY: Ooh, yes please.   Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm? 
HOLLY: Pencils down!   Just kidding, take your time. 
HOLLY: Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have? 
HOLLY: Really? 
HOLLY: Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth! 
HOLLY: She's with Angela. 
HOLLY: So much happening.  
HOLLY: So we kiss occasionally. 
HOLLY: So we're only eight pounds behind Utica. Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all. 
HOLLY: So you missed something really big. 
HOLLY: So, I've gone over corporate policy. 
HOLLY: So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number. 
HOLLY: So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been? 
HOLLY: So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter. 
HOLLY: So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or... 
HOLLY: Someday I would love to hear "Beers in Heaven." 
HOLLY: Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things. 
HOLLY: Sounds good. 
HOLLY: Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about. 
HOLLY: Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below. 
HOLLY: Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?... 
HOLLY: Thank you, you too. 
HOLLY: Thank you. In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing. 
HOLLY: Thanks Michael.   Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired. 
HOLLY: Thanks. 
HOLLY: Thanks. That's sweet. Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds. 
HOLLY: That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies. 
HOLLY: That is correct! 
HOLLY: That is correct!   How did you know that?!   
HOLLY: That is correct! Man from 
HOLLY: That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors? 
HOLLY: That's certainly opinionated. 
HOLLY: That's good. 
HOLLY: That's so lame they didn't invite us. 
HOLLY: That-That's my car. 
HOLLY: The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me. 
HOLLY: The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush! 
HOLLY: The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true. David 
HOLLY: There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women. 
HOLLY: There weren't any laughs. 
HOLLY: There's too much distance. 
HOLLY: They didn't know? 
HOLLY: They're warm. 
HOLLY: This is your moms old stuff? 
HOLLY: Three nuns,  from a Missionary in South Africa. 
HOLLY: Today is ethics day. After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here. It's gonna be insaaaaane. No, it's not. I have to read from the binder. 
HOLLY: Two people in love? 
HOLLY: Uh, what? 
HOLLY: Uh... which part? 
HOLLY: Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that? 
HOLLY: Uhm. 
HOLLY: Uhm... 
HOLLY: Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there? Holly's 
HOLLY: Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look? 
HOLLY: Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just-- 
HOLLY: Um, not much. 
HOLLY: Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael? Holly's 
HOLLY: Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager?   
HOLLY: Um... Y-yeah. Okay. 
HOLLY: Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it. 
HOLLY: Unnnnnnngh! 
HOLLY: Waaa! More paper! Waaa!   No, she's just on a coffee break. 
HOLLY: Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, "oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl." Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me? 
HOLLY: We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog. 
HOLLY: We don't know that. 
HOLLY: We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents.   
HOLLY: We have to try this out on somebody. 
HOLLY: We live together. 
HOLLY: We punish her? 
HOLLY: We sat down and we watched them all in one day. 
HOLLY: We weren't in love last time. 
HOLLY: Well- 
HOLLY: Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard. 
HOLLY: Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too.  
HOLLY: Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim. 
HOLLY: Well that is a very safe place for them. 
HOLLY: Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace. I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this. 
HOLLY: Well we could put it in storage... in case. 
HOLLY: Well who do you have? Holly's 
HOLLY: Well why do you have to make a movie at all? 
HOLLY: Well you don't have to agree. 
HOLLY: Well, at least everyone lost weight. That's all that really matters. 
HOLLY: Well, I just have to get through the binder. 
HOLLY: Well, I'm glad we did it. 
HOLLY: Well, no. Dwight... 
HOLLY: Well, some girls go through a phase. 
HOLLY: Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol. Those are the rules. 
HOLLY: Well, what do you like to eat? 
HOLLY: We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine... 
HOLLY: We're only halfway? 
HOLLY: Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before! 
HOLLY: What ah you wicked smaht? 
HOLLY: What am I saying? 
HOLLY: What are you doing here? Oh, my God. 
HOLLY: What are you doing up here? 
HOLLY: What are you doing? 
HOLLY: What do you do here? 
HOLLY: What do you do in your free time? 
HOLLY: What do you do? 
HOLLY: What happened here? 
HOLLY: What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons? I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper? Meredith:Well it's funny. Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself.   Hey what's going on here? I thought I had immunity? 
HOLLY: What if I said it wasn't up to them? 
HOLLY: What was the dilemma? 
HOLLY: What? AJ! 
HOLLY: What? Cell Phone Sales 
HOLLY: What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying? 
HOLLY: What? What are you talking about? 
HOLLY: What'd you think? 
HOLLY: What's protocol on this? 
HOLLY: What's up? 
HOLLY: What's wrong? 
HOLLY: Which way did he go? 
HOLLY: Who ahh? 
HOLLY: Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together? 
HOLLY: Why? 
HOLLY: Why? 
HOLLY: Wikka wikka wikka what? 
HOLLY: Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all. 
HOLLY: Would you put those out? 
HOLLY: Wow! Nice. 
HOLLY: Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you.  
HOLLY: Yeah it did look shorter on the map- 
HOLLY: Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him. 
HOLLY: Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants. 
HOLLY: Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable. 
HOLLY: Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience. 
HOLLY: Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott. 
HOLLY: Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here. 
HOLLY: Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go.  I gotta buckle him in. 
HOLLY: Yeah, it was nice. 
HOLLY: Yeah, kind of. 
HOLLY: Yeah, lets go grab them. 
HOLLY: Yeah, that's good. 
HOLLY: Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.

HOLLY: Yep, the old comedy team is back together again. 
HOLLY: Yep. Just like you. 
HOLLY: Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff. 
HOLLY: Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company. Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters? 
HOLLY: Yes, Michael? 
HOLLY: Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar. 
HOLLY: Yes. 
HOLLY: Yes. 
HOLLY: Yes. Number three. 
HOLLY: Yoga. 
HOLLY: You do? 
HOLLY: You guys, it wasn't my fault. 
HOLLY: You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt. 
HOLLY: You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look. 
HOLLY: You know... in case if something changes. 
HOLLY: You made ourselves to be more than we were. 
HOLLY: You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you? 
HOLLY: You must be Todd. 
HOLLY: You never told me you made a movie. 
HOLLY: You OK? You seem kind of... 
HOLLY: You romanticize things. 
HOLLY: You said you would. 
HOLLY: You still gonna be mean to me? 
HOLLY: You think this is funny? 
HOLLY: You too. 
HOLLY: You were sleeping? You were talking before. 
HOLLY: You will. 
HOLLY: You'll be okay 
HOLLY: Your wife becoming me will I.  
HOLLY: You're crazy, go crazy. 
HOLLY: You're not touching me. 
HOLLY: You're shaking. Are you all right? 
HOLY: I'm not so specific as I can be on my first day, but... 
HOLY: She was laughing hysterically that whole time!

IRENE:  Thank you.  Oh, what kind of tea is this? 
IRENE: Did you wash your hands? 
IRENE: Erin, I think you're making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy.

IRENE: He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture. 
IRENE: He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down. 
IRENE: I think you should leave, young man.

JACK: He's just sucking up! 
JACK: Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here? 
JACK: Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight? Captain 
JACK: I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship.  Hi, welcome aboard. 
JACK: I want you to take all of your frustrations, with women, the system, with everything. Take it out on the puck. All on the puck. 
JACK: Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you! 
JACK: Michael. 
JACK: Mop it.  Now take this. 
JACK: Mop.  
JACK: Nope! Dance contest! 
JACK: Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo! 
JACK: Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her. 
JACK: Okay! So... 
JACK: Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack. 
JACK: Okay, Michael, if you don't mind... 
JACK: Okay... 
JACK: Please, okay? 
JACK: Please. The life preservers.

JACK: Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save? 
JACK: That's a stupid analogy. 
JACK: They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat. 
JACK: This is where Captain Jack drives the boat. 
JACK: Uh... usually it's a woman. 
JACK: We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship! 
JACK: Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm. 
JACK: Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side.  Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here... 
JACK: Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right? 
JACK: Women and children. 
JACK: Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?

JAN:   How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one... 
JAN:   Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep. 
JAN:   That's funny. 
JAN:   There you are. 
JAN:  ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers.  Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B.  The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...

JAN:  I'm just gonna check on dinner.  
JAN:  I'm not sure that's realistic. 
JAN:  I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here. The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it? 
JAN:  Is it because of these? 
JAN:  Is Toby there? 
JAN:  It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael. 
JAN:  Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about. 
JAN:  Michael!  Michael. What are you doing to him? Officer 
JAN:  Michael, ... 
JAN:  Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say. 
JAN:  Michael, I left a meeting. What is so urgent? Are you, are you okay? 
JAN:  Michael. 
JAN:  Michael. 
JAN:  Mmhmm. 
JAN:  Mommy, you re a princess. Mommy, you re a superstar. Mommy you re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es? 
JAN:  My friends? Michael, I was terminated. 
JAN:  Oh, excuse us just a second. 
JAN:  Oh, I know, I know. It's just... I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do? 
JAN:  Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry. 
JAN:  Okay, where did he go? 
JAN:  'Scuse me, I'm sorry.  Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer. 
JAN:  So glad you're finally able to be here. 
JAN:  So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone? 
JAN:  So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck. 
JAN:  Thank you, Dwight. 
JAN:  The hostages are under the stadium.  
JAN:  They call me Jasmine Winsong. 
JAN:  Uh, not even close. 
JAN:  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye.  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here? 
JAN:  Well, is he coming right back? 
JAN:  Well, that -- that was -- that was me too. 
JAN:  Wha... what's going on here? 
JAN:  What did you learn? 
JAN:  Where is it? 
JAN:  Where's Michael? 
JAN:  Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee. 
JAN:  Yeah, what? 
JAN:  Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then.  Hi. 
JAN:  You're broke? 
JAN: $300? 
JAN: ... but it's very destructive. 
JAN: ... happen when... 
JAN: ... touch that. 
JAN: ... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad. 
JAN: ...and I have to get back to work. 
JAN: ...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica. 
JAN: ...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship. You know this. Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it. 
JAN: ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body. 
JAN: ...Happy birthday, Michael. 
JAN: ...in your office? 
JAN: ...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you. I did not. 
JAN: ...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash. 
JAN: A futon's not a sofa. 
JAN: A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages. 
JAN: After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation. 
JAN: Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off. 
JAN: Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe. 
JAN: Ah. Thanks, Dwight. 
JAN: Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay. 
JAN: Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales. 
JAN: All right, fine, just a second. Hold on. 
JAN: All right, well are you gonna take care of this? 
JAN: All right. Let's talk about clothing. 
JAN: All right. Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes. I'm exhausted, so um. Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529. Wake me in twenty. 
JAN: Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even. 
JAN: Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition. 
JAN: Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda? 
JAN: Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs. 
JAN: Alright. 
JAN: Alright. 
JAN: Alright.  
JAN: Alright. But you will let me run this meeting. 
JAN: Am I on camera? 
JAN: Am I on speaker phone? 
JAN: And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money. 
JAN: And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth.   
JAN: And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch. 
JAN: And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation... 
JAN: And Michael Scott, Scranton. 
JAN: And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks. 
JAN: And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so... 
JAN: And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior. 
JAN: And this is my workspace. 
JAN: And you guys have a good time together. 
JAN: And you had a luau.... 
JAN: And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that- 
JAN: AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST! 
JAN: Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before... 
JAN: Are camera's there? 
JAN: Are the cameras with you... 
JAN: Are you gonna keep me in suspense?  
JAN: Are you listening to me Michael? 
JAN: Are you there Michael? 
JAN: Assy! Awwhhh how was school? 
JAN: Astrid. 
JAN: At least he's an artist. 
JAN: At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars. 
JAN: At this time in my life. I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok? 
JAN: Aw. 
JAN: Aw. 
JAN: Awesome. 
JAN: Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down? 
JAN: Back? 
JAN: Because nothing did, Michael. It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same 
JAN: Been good. 
JAN: Best decision I ever made. 
JAN: Bye Babe! 
JAN: Bye... thanks.  Yes! 
JAN: Bye-bye. 
JAN: Can we just move on to another question? 
JAN: Can we please go in your office? 
JAN: Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael? 
JAN: Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam. 
JAN: Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport. 
JAN: 'Cause he likes them.  Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about. 
JAN: Cece can t spell her name. 
JAN: Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe? 
JAN: Christian, you don't have to listen to this. 
JAN: Christian. 
JAN: Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck! 
JAN: Come on. 
JAN: Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it. 
JAN: Coming!  
JAN: Conniving little runt. Put him through. 
JAN: Cosmopolitan, please. 
JAN: Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken? 
JAN: Da--- Darryl from the warehouse? 
JAN: Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I... 
JAN: David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please. 
JAN: Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit? 
JAN: Did you take care of the situation? 
JAN: Different salary.  You'll get there, don't worry. 
JAN: Do we understand each other. 
JAN: Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour? 
JAN: Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter. Hunter's 
JAN: Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first? 
JAN: Do you have a preference, upstairs first? 
JAN: Do you need to see the video again, Michael? 
JAN: Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance? 
JAN: Do you want to look at mine? 
JAN: Does anyone want a drink? 
JAN: Does this work for you? 
JAN: Don t patronize me. 
JAN: Don't date Holly. 
JAN: Don't let them change you, okay?  So long, . 
JAN: Don't say another word. 
JAN: Don't you know what I'm doing? 
JAN: Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be. 
JAN: Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse. 
JAN: Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand? 
JAN: Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers. 
JAN: Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote "Beeswax. Not yours, Inc." 
JAN: Erratic? 
JAN: Excuse me. 
JAN: Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that . They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael. 
JAN: Excuse me? 
JAN: Excuse me? 
JAN: Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here. 
JAN: Fine Michael. Thank you. 
JAN: Fine, fast food's fine. 
JAN: Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want. 
JAN: Fine. 
JAN: Fine. I will show you one... slide show. 
JAN: Follow me. 
JAN: FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY! 
JAN: Four million. 
JAN: From sales? 
JAN: From the Scranton Branch. 
JAN: Get yourself down stairs. 
JAN: Go ahead. 
JAN: Go by yourself. 
JAN: Good luck with your band. 
JAN: Good luck with your interview.  Bye. 
JAN: Good, good. 
JAN: Good. 
JAN: Good. 
JAN: Good. Have you told anyone? 
JAN: Goodbye, Michael. 
JAN: Goodbye.  
JAN: Great! 
JAN: Great! Uh-huh? 
JAN: Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream? 
JAN: Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour. 
JAN: Great. 
JAN: Great. Phyllis? 
JAN: Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present. 
JAN: Great. Very good. 
JAN: He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it. But he also knew that I did. I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine. 
JAN: He finished his movie?  No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him. 
JAN: Hello everyone. Hello Michael. 
JAN: Hello, Michael. 
JAN: Hello... Michael. 
JAN: Hello? 
JAN: Hello?  
JAN: He's such a snake. 
JAN: He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this. 
JAN: Hey babe? 
JAN: Hey you! 
JAN: Hey. 
JAN: Hey. I'm leaving. 
JAN: Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone. 
JAN: Hi, Jim! 
JAN: Hi, Pam. 
JAN: Hi, Pam. 
JAN: Hi, Toby.  First---  First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear? 
JAN: Hi. 
JAN: Hi. 
JAN: Hi. 
JAN: Hi. 
JAN: Hi. 
JAN: Hmm. 
JAN: How about Chinese? 
JAN: How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it. 
JAN: How are you? 
JAN: How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner? 
JAN: How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you. 
JAN: How do you know I like that store? 
JAN: How do you know that? 
JAN: How is that a business question? 
JAN: How was improv? 
JAN: How was your interview? 
JAN: How would a movie increase productivity Michael? How on earth would it do that? 
JAN: I -- I -- 
JAN: I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch. 
JAN: I am really-  Thrilled.  Let's go. 
JAN: I am returning your many calls. 
JAN: I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay? But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a ing kid. 
JAN: I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star. 
JAN: I bet you are. 
JAN: I can't, I can't- 
JAN: I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night. 
JAN: I didn't go. 
JAN: I didn't mean it. I was... 
JAN: I didn't... 
JAN: I didn't... I don't know... 
JAN: I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles.  Smell. 
JAN: I don t recall. And yes, Molly is crap. 
JAN: I don't care how your day was Michael. 
JAN: I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know. 
JAN: I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off. 
JAN: I don't know what you're doing here, Michael, 
JAN: I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club. 
JAN: I don't think Christian has time for that. 
JAN: I don't want to... 
JAN: I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior. 
JAN: I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities. 
JAN: I feel sick. 
JAN: I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this. 
JAN: I hate my life. 
JAN: I have to call you the second I get a new assistant? 
JAN: I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit. 
JAN: I just didn't! 
JAN: I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees. 
JAN: I just,  I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things. 
JAN: I know Scranton. 
JAN: I know what a futon is, Michael. 
JAN: I know. 
JAN: I love you too. Diane 
JAN: I m a very busy woman, so... 
JAN: I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow. 
JAN: I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself. 
JAN: I think so, Michael... 
JAN: I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff. 
JAN: I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing? 
JAN: I thought that you were their fearless leader. 
JAN: I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county. 
JAN: I told you not to say it. Do you remember that? 
JAN: I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister. 
JAN: I was stupid. Michael and 
JAN: I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct? 
JAN: I was watching Jim. 
JAN: I went to a sperm bank. 
JAN: I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip. 
JAN: I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family. 
JAN: I... 
JAN: If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count. 
JAN: If it's a couple blocks away- 
JAN: If you have a- 
JAN: IHop. 
JAN: I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser. 
JAN: I'll talk to you later. 
JAN: I'm closer to firing you. 
JAN: I'm divorced. 
JAN: I'm doing it right now. To you. 
JAN: I'm gonna make some calls. 
JAN: I'm good; how are you? 
JAN: I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok? 
JAN: I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute? 
JAN: I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow. 
JAN: I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though. 
JAN: I'm not going to do that Michael. 
JAN: I'm not... 
JAN: I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then? 
JAN: I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet. 
JAN: I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes. 
JAN: I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR. 
JAN: I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service. 
JAN: I'm your boss. 
JAN: I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent. 
JAN: In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me? 
JAN: Incidentally, what is the charity? 
JAN: Insightful, Pam. 
JAN: Is anybody else in the... 
JAN: Is it really that important to you? 
JAN: Is Michael in? 
JAN: Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael? 
JAN: It costs what it costs. 
JAN: It said that. 
JAN: It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said "Honey keep the trophies." 
JAN: It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him. 
JAN: It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer? 
JAN: It was. Yeah, it was good.  I think I'll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time. 
JAN: It was. Yes. 
JAN: It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now. 
JAN: It's nice. 
JAN: It's not about a surprise party is it? 
JAN: It's pine. 
JAN: It's your job. So... 
JAN: It's... it's about talent. 
JAN: I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together. 
JAN: I've never told you that I love you. 
JAN: I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other. 
JAN: Joe Camel! 
JAN: Josh Porter, Stamford. 
JAN: Just before lunch. That would be great. 
JAN: Just Jan Levinson. 
JAN: Just let me loosen my dress. 
JAN: Just like that. 
JAN: Just the one. 
JAN: 'K? 
JAN: Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize. 
JAN: Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed 
JAN: Let's go. 
JAN: Let's just blow this party off. 
JAN: Live together. Actually, wait a minute! This could be great! This could be perfect! You know, my full-time job could be our relationship. I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15.  It could work. This could work, really! 
JAN: Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back. 
JAN: Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner... 
JAN: Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  Do you have a light? 
JAN: Magically? 
JAN: Martini please. 
JAN: Men love this one. 
JAN: Michael--- 
JAN: Michael--- 
JAN: Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem. 
JAN: Michael that's irrational. 
JAN: Michael! 
JAN: Michael! 
JAN: Michael! 
JAN: Michael! Michael! Michael! 
JAN: Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything. You know that. 
JAN: Michael, don't panic. 
JAN: Michael, Ed died over the weekend. 
JAN: Michael, he's your branch's HR rep... 
JAN: Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy. 
JAN: Michael, I need your help. 
JAN: Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down. 
JAN: Michael, it has nothing- 
JAN: Michael, just relax, okay? 
JAN: Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office! 
JAN: Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high. I'll take that. 
JAN: Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So, where's this train taking us? 
JAN: Michael, now is not the time or the place. 
JAN: Michael, please. Todd 
JAN: Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour. 
JAN: Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7. 
JAN: Michael, we got divorced, ok?  I'm so sorry. Excuse me. 
JAN: Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand? 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael. 
JAN: Michael.  Uh, could we have a table for three, please? 
JAN: Michael. MICHAEL! 
JAN: Michael...  I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So...  I'm sorry. 
JAN: Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here. 
JAN: Michael... maybe... I mean... 
JAN: Michael? 
JAN: Michael? 
JAN: Michael? 
JAN: Michael? 
JAN: Michael? 
JAN: Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really. 
JAN: Mmhmm. 
JAN: Mm-hmm. 
JAN: Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont. 
JAN: Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan. 
JAN: Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself. 
JAN: Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous. 
JAN: Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.' 
JAN: Nice to meet you. 
JAN: Nice to see you too, Michael. 
JAN: Nice to see you. 
JAN: No I'm the princess, and the queen. 
JAN: No it's not. It's officially not. 
JAN: No no no, no names, no names, no rhyming, no soundalikes. 
JAN: No rhyming! 
JAN: No smiling. 
JAN: NO! 
JAN: No! In the beginning we were not good. 
JAN: No, Dwight; come in. 
JAN: No, I am saying we are never having this conversation. 
JAN: No, I do. 
JAN: No, I wanna know. I wanna know! Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court! 
JAN: No, I... 
JAN: No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you. 
JAN: No, it's not possible. 
JAN: No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it. Okay? 
JAN: No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize. 
JAN: No, Michael. Oh, come on. 
JAN: No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep. So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby. 
JAN: NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired. 
JAN: No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables. 
JAN: No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided. 
JAN: No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen! 
JAN: No, so what couldn't wait? 
JAN: No, that's not--- 
JAN: No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this. 
JAN: No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public. 
JAN: No. 
JAN: No. 
JAN: No. 
JAN: No. 
JAN: No. 
JAN: No. 
JAN: No. 
JAN: No.  Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long? 
JAN: No. But we can offer you 12. 
JAN: No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch. 
JAN: No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss. 
JAN: No. Okay. Stop. Go on... 
JAN: No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again. 
JAN: No? 
JAN: Not like that. 
JAN: Not super exciting. 
JAN: Not too good. 
JAN: Nothing? 
JAN: Now you're really not allowed in this session. 
JAN: Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott? 
JAN: Of Ed? 
JAN: Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done. 
JAN: Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed. 
JAN: Oh no, Michael, Michael, please. No, really. 
JAN: Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated. 
JAN: Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with. 
JAN: Oh! 
JAN: Oh! Michael, for God sakes! 
JAN: Oh, Andy. 
JAN: Oh, God! I mean, I just don't understand! It's just so rude, you know? I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy! 
JAN: Oh, God. 
JAN: Oh, God. 
JAN: Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand? 
JAN: Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics? 
JAN: Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing? Guess whose candles they used for the vigil? 
JAN: Oh, hey! 
JAN: Oh, how thoughtful. 
JAN: Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out. 
JAN: Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know? It's fine, actually, I do. I really think it's great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so...  
JAN: Oh, me too. Me too. 
JAN: Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice. 
JAN: Oh, no, it's OK.  So, uh, Happy valentine's Day. 
JAN: Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go. 
JAN: Oh, no, that's alright. I wanna leave straight from there. 
JAN: Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please. 
JAN: Oh, okay. 
JAN: Oh, please. 
JAN: Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table. 
JAN: Oh, they found her? 
JAN: Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah. 
JAN: Oh. 
JAN: Oh.  
JAN: Oh.  I'll put in a good word for you. 
JAN: Ohh...  
JAN: Ohhh, God. 
JAN: Ok! Here's what I'm gonna 
JAN: OK, name please. 
JAN: Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior. 
JAN: Ok, Toby, how about if you... 
JAN: Ok, what... what is the situation Toby? 
JAN: OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately. 
JAN: OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's... 
JAN: Ok. 
JAN: Ok. 
JAN: Ok. 
JAN: OK. 
JAN: Ok.  
JAN: OK.  "It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want..." 
JAN: OK.  Craig, 
JAN: Ok. Let's just go to a motel... 
JAN: OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch. 
JAN: OK. You know what? There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me. 
JAN: Okay! 
JAN: Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question? 
JAN: Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15. 
JAN: Okay, Michael. Please, why don't we just take a break. This is really going nowhere. 
JAN: Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move. 
JAN: Okay, then. I will see you tonight. 
JAN: Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense. 
JAN: Okay, you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. Not leaving. 
JAN: Okay. 
JAN: Okay. 
JAN: Okay. 
JAN: Okay.  
JAN: Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five. 
JAN: On a what? 
JAN: One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner? 
JAN: Oops. 
JAN: Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future. 
JAN: Pam? 
JAN: People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater. 
JAN: Period. 
JAN: Please don't cry. 
JAN: Please don't smell me, Michael. 
JAN: Please sit down. 
JAN: Please, sit yourself down. 
JAN: Please? Thank you. very much. 
JAN: Really. You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok? 
JAN: Really? 
JAN: Really? 
JAN: Really? 
JAN: Really? 
JAN: Really? 
JAN: Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you? 
JAN: Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior. 
JAN: Right now we can offer you a 6% raise. 
JAN: Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense. 
JAN: Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan. 
JAN: See you soon. 
JAN: See, he fits perfectly. 
JAN: Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing? 
JAN: Shame on you. 
JAN: Shut up. 
JAN: Slam me up against the wall, right here. 
JAN: Smoke? 
JAN: So- 
JAN: So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then? 
JAN: So call me when you feel like having a real conversation. 
JAN: So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily. 
JAN: So I heard that you were peeping on Michael. 
JAN: So music, should we turn some music? 
JAN: So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white. 
JAN: So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first? 
JAN: So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um- 
JAN: So which way is Chili's? 
JAN: So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud. 
JAN: So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well. 
JAN: So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two. 
JAN: So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight. 
JAN: So, what's Ryan doing here? 
JAN: So, which health plan have you decided on? 
JAN: So...  there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently. 
JAN: So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford. 
JAN: So... we're good? 
JAN: Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time. 
JAN: Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail. 
JAN: Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just.  
JAN: Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means... 
JAN: Step away from me, Michael. 
JAN: Still on speaker? 
JAN: Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment. 
JAN: Stop that. 
JAN: Stop. 
JAN: Surely, you cannot be serious? 
JAN: Tell Angela to send me a final invoice. 
JAN: Tell me what you did yesterday. 
JAN: Tell me what you did yesterday. 
JAN: Tell me what? 
JAN: Thank God. 
JAN: Thank you, Hunter.  Hello. Come in.  Ah, Okay. 
JAN: Thank you, thank you. 
JAN: Thank you. 
JAN: Thank you. 
JAN: Thank you. 
JAN: Thank you. That's very sweet of you. 
JAN: Thanks for the baby shower. It was great. And I'll see you... soon. 
JAN: Thanks Pam. 
JAN: Thanks. 
JAN: That is an excellent goal. 
JAN: That sounds serious, Michael. 
JAN: That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion. 
JAN: That's a serious offense! 
JAN: That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it. 
JAN: That's his ex. 
JAN: That's my new assistant. 
JAN: That's not my sense of humor. 
JAN: That's not what it's called. 
JAN: That's too bad. 
JAN: The board voted last night to close your branch. 
JAN: The board's. 
JAN: The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here? 
JAN: The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan. 
JAN: There are always a million reasons not to do something. 
JAN: There's no prize money. 
JAN: Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals... 
JAN: This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing. 
JAN: This is a projection of the county's needs... 
JAN: This is Jan. 
JAN: This is my baby. 
JAN: This is my office. 
JAN: This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks. 
JAN: This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you. 
JAN: Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it. 
JAN: To kinda clear my mind. 
JAN: Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five? 
JAN: Today? 
JAN: trid. 
JAN: Uh-  
JAN: Uh when, when did, when last night? 
JAN: Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky. 
JAN: Uh, how are you? 
JAN: Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting  is it happening right now? 
JAN: Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad. 
JAN: Uh, no. 
JAN: Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line. 
JAN: Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it. 
JAN: Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few. 
JAN: Uh, yeah. 
JAN: Uh, yes. 
JAN: Uh, yes. Yes you can. 
JAN: Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael. 
JAN: Uh... come on. 
JAN: Uh-huh, Bonfire. 
JAN: Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant? 
JAN: Um, no, I want it up. My hair. 
JAN: Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office. 
JAN: Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo. 
JAN: Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael? 
JAN: Water? Water?  Water babe? 
JAN: We all checked in? 
JAN: We get that money for hiring an ex-convict. 
JAN: We got it! 
JAN: We have gone through this. 
JAN: We saw Wicked. 
JAN: We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match. 
JAN: We'd been fighting for a while- 
JAN: Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me. 
JAN: Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong! 
JAN: Well it was good to see you. 
JAN: Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth. And it was really, really quite amazing. 
JAN: Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time... 
JAN: Well, I faxed one over to you this morning. 
JAN: Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right? 
JAN: Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life. 
JAN: Well, it s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean,  Cece  is two letters and  Astrid  is... I mean, there s even some adults who -- who -- who can t spell it. 
JAN: Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael. 
JAN: Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out. 
JAN: Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been... 
JAN: Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him. 
JAN: Well, Michael, I underestimated you. 
JAN: Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call. 
JAN: Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title. 
JAN: Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him. 
JAN: Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything. 
JAN: Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch. 
JAN: Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too. 
JAN: Well, today's not my birthday, so... 
JAN: Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and- 
JAN: Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person. 
JAN: Well, what would you suggest? 
JAN: Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen. 
JAN: Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going? 
JAN: Well, you should. 
JAN: Well... 
JAN: Well... 
JAN: We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please. 
JAN: We're good.  Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok? 
JAN: We're in a meeting. 
JAN: We've created an incentive program to increase sales. 
JAN: Wha... 
JAN: Wha... excuse... why not? 
JAN: What about him? 
JAN: What are you doing here? 
JAN: What are you doing? 
JAN: What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me. 
JAN: What are you talking about? 
JAN: What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about? 
JAN: What did I just say? 
JAN: What did I tell you about "yeppers?" 
JAN: What does that mean? 
JAN: What have you generated, Michael? 
JAN: What is he doing here? 
JAN: What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael? 
JAN: What party? 
JAN: What the hell are you two talking about? 
JAN: What would you do differently? 
JAN: What, Michael. 
JAN: What? 
JAN: What? 
JAN: What? 
JAN: What? 
JAN: What? 
JAN: What? 
JAN: What? 
JAN: What? A union! What... 
JAN: What? I'm sorry? 
JAN: What? No Michael! 
JAN: What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two. 
JAN: What's going on? 
JAN: What's the bottom line? 
JAN: What's this over the "i"? 
JAN: What's wrong with you? 
JAN: What's... what's the matter? What... what happened in there? 
JAN: When did the check come? 
JAN: When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away. 
JAN: Where s Wallace? 
JAN: Where's Astrid? 
JAN: Where's Michael Scott? 
JAN: Who is this? 
JAN: Who is this? 
JAN: Why am I here, Michael? 
JAN: Why did I hook up with Michael? 
JAN: Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking. 
JAN: Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends? 
JAN: Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying? 
JAN: Why would we need a signal? 
JAN: Why? 
JAN: Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car? 
JAN: Will you uh,  you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business. 
JAN: With your looks, ok? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate. 
JAN: Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So... 
JAN: Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world.  We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom. 
JAN: Yeah! 
JAN: Yeah, it did... 
JAN: Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb. 
JAN: Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just  can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together. 
JAN: Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here. 
JAN: Yeah, so... 
JAN: Yeah. 
JAN: Yeah. 
JAN: Yeah. 
JAN: Yeah. 
JAN: Yeah. 
JAN: Yeah.  Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget...  I love that commercial. 
JAN: Yeah? 
JAN: Yes, Michael, they do. 
JAN: Yes, Pam? 
JAN: Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah. 
JAN: You already had a party on May 5th for no reason. 
JAN: You are not allowed in this session. 
JAN: You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil. 
JAN: YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT! 
JAN: You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately. 
JAN: You do. 
JAN: You do? 
JAN: You don't flash around a newborn baby. Don't you know that? 
JAN: You drive, I had too much wine. 
JAN: You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out. 
JAN: You had no right to do that, Michael. 
JAN: You keep it under my side of the mattress. 
JAN: You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business. 
JAN: You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight. 
JAN: You know that I'm very serious here. 
JAN: You know the company is offering a design training program in New York. 
JAN: You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan. 
JAN: You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today... 
JAN: You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with? 
JAN: You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever.  
JAN: You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option. 
JAN: You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on? 
JAN: You know, I... I thought about it and you are right. 
JAN: You know, imagine... you were gay. 
JAN: You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation. 
JAN: You leveraged your new position with us into another offer? 
JAN: You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers. 
JAN: You ok? 
JAN: You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company. 
JAN: You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem? 
JAN: You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam. 
JAN: You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other. 
JAN: You son of a bitch! 
JAN: You son of a bitch. You re firing me? Where the hell do you get off? 
JAN: You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in. 
JAN: You went to a bachelor party at work? 
JAN: Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically. 
JAN: You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off? 
JAN: You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that. 
JAN: You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there. 
JAN: You're over 75 years old? 
JAN: You're sad about this. I know that, and I wish that I... but... would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit? 
JAN: Yuh-huh. 
JEB:  Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here. 
JEB: After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out  worm  means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of... pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management. 
JEB: Buddy? Buddy? 
JEB: Couple of nights couldn't hurt. 
JEB: Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any. German 
JEB: Hi, Fannie. 
JEB: I didn't really see a better parking spot.  Whoa! Look what I did. It's a rental.  You wanna go in?  
JEB: It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow. 
JEB: Oof. This is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Not it. 
JEB: Snap out of it. Dwight? 
JEB: Totally. Yep. The people here are like  Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart? 
JEB: Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all. 
JERRY:  Oh. Got to take this. Sorry. 
JERRY: And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going? 
JERRY: Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room. 
JERRY: I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are? 
JERRY: It doesn't lock for the children's safety. 
JERRY: It was story time. 
JERRY: Oh, so you saw it already? 
JERRY: Okay. Hi, this is Jerry. 
JERRY: Pam and Jim? Hey, I'm Jerry. 
JERRY: Seriously? You told her? 
JERRY: Sorry about that. Right this way. 
JERRY: That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, and you're already lining up your holiday plans. 
JERRY: Well, you didn't consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well? 
JERRY: Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it. 
JESSICA:  Come on. Let's chicken fight those two. 
JESSICA:  I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful... 
JESSICA:  Thank you. 
JESSICA:  What are you doing? 
JESSICA:  Wow. 
JESSICA:  Yes! 
JESSICA: Ah.. 
JESSICA: Andy! Hey! 
JESSICA: Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable. 
JESSICA: Bye ...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it. 
JESSICA: Did you not... 
JESSICA: Dive in right here. 
JESSICA: Go away. 
JESSICA: Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything? 
JESSICA: Here we go!  Yes! 
JESSICA: Hey. 
JESSICA: Hey. 
JESSICA: Hi. 
JESSICA: Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy? 
JESSICA: I cannot believe it either. 
JESSICA: I can't say it doesn't make sense... 
JESSICA: I dunno. 
JESSICA: I'll let him know. 
JESSICA: I'll see you at home? 
JESSICA: It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off? 
JESSICA: Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now. 
JESSICA: My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut. 
JESSICA: No, she, she seems fine. 
JESSICA: No, show me. 
JESSICA: Oh 
JESSICA: Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it? 
JESSICA: Oh my god. How could somebody do that? 
JESSICA: Oh!  Oof! 
JESSICA: Oh, he's on a call. 
JESSICA: Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office. 
JESSICA: Oh. 
JESSICA: Oh. 
JESSICA: OK 
JESSICA: OK  Bye. 
JESSICA: OK. 
JESSICA: Okay. You don't know what you're doing. 
JESSICA: Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse. 
JESSICA: Spontaneous scoliosis.  
JESSICA: That's uh, that's the girl you dated. 
JESSICA: Uh huh. 
JESSICA: Uh, yeah, sure. What's up? 
JESSICA: Uh, yeah. What is it? 
JESSICA: Um, it ta-, um it depends. 
JESSICA: What are you doing here? 
JESSICA: What? 
JESSICA: Whoo! 
JESSICA: Yeah! 
JESSICA: Yeah! Great!  
JESSICA: Yeah, come on! 
JESSICA: You guys ready? 
JESSICA: You're breaking up with me?

JIM:   
JIM:   
JIM:   
JIM:   19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds? 
JIM:   About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying. 
JIM:   All right, you ready for this? 
JIM:   Are you kidding? 
JIM:   Are you sure? 
JIM:   Ayyyy! 
JIM:   Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!  Ryan 
JIM:   Can you believe this?   He was pretty talkative at breakfast. 
JIM:   Carol. 
JIM:   Didn't see that one coming. 
JIM:   Empty. 
JIM:   Go ahead. 
JIM:   Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do? 
JIM:   Hello? 
JIM:   Hey! You busy? 
JIM:   Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home? 
JIM:   Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message. 
JIM:   Hey, it's me. It is 5:03. 
JIM:   Hey, Kelly. 
JIM:   Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket.   One of my clients found a golden ticket.     Yup. No, congratulations.   
JIM:   Hey. 
JIM:   Hey. I saw you called. Jim 
JIM:   Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way. 
JIM:   Hi. 
JIM:   Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't. 
JIM:   Hold on one second. 
JIM:   How does everyone know already? 
JIM:   How old's Kelly? 
JIM:   I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should.   
JIM:   I don't know. Is it classy enough? 
JIM:   I just totally blew a sales call. 
JIM:   I'll take that down right now. 
JIM:   I'm always this close. 
JIM:   I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um...   
JIM:   I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying. 
JIM:   It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania. 
JIM:   Its Monster dot com. Singular. 
JIM:   Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through   delusion. 
JIM:   Jan. 
JIM:   Just, easy. 
JIM:   Make the face.   Yeah, I don't see it. 
JIM:   Michael Scott, manager. Hi, how are ya? 
JIM:   Michael! Michael! 
JIM:   No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand.   Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand.   
JIM:   No, no. Nope. 
JIM:   No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And   we are not that couple.   
JIM:   No... way! 
JIM:   Oh my God! 
JIM:   Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great.   Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs!   Ohh!  
JIM:   Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert. 
JIM:   Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
JIM:   Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch? 
JIM:   Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting. 
JIM:   One second. 
JIM:   Really, nothing? 
JIM:   She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other. 
JIM:   Side effects of EMF 
JIM:   So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party. 
JIM:   So I'm still in the process of converting the garage. It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect   for an art studio.   Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that. And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just--- 
JIM:   Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out. 
JIM:   Testing, testing. Hello, everybody. 
JIM:   These are for you. 
JIM:   They've been in there for 45 minutes. 
JIM:   Three, two, one...   
JIM:   We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you. 
JIM:   What are you standing for? 
JIM:   What are you thinking? 
JIM:   What's going on? 
JIM:   Whew. 
JIM:   Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know. 
JIM:   Would you please stop that? 
JIM:   W---Wow. Um. Well... okay. 
JIM:   Yawn. Four seconds. 
JIM:   Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something! 
JIM:   You gonna answer that, Kev? 
JIM:   You know that I was doin' this. 
JIM:   You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you. 
JIM:   You okay? 
JIM:  "Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese."  Damn it, Dwight! 
JIM:  "It's not freakin' funny!" 
JIM:  "Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already. 
JIM:  "Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie." 
JIM:  ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon. 
JIM:  ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good. 
JIM:  ...W R K. 
JIM:  ...What is it? 
JIM:  ...What? 
JIM:  ...what? 
JIM:  : OK. 
JIM:  A banana? 
JIM:  Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool.  
JIM:  Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this. 
JIM:  Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home. 
JIM:  Ah! Classic, right?  
JIM:  Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do. 
JIM:  Ahh, what happened to you? 
JIM:  All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again.  'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry. 
JIM:  All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss. 
JIM:  All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you.  
JIM:  All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now!  
JIM:  All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right.  Whoo!  
JIM:  All right. 
JIM:  All right. So... I guess this is it. 
JIM:  All right. There he is. 
JIM:  Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic. 
JIM:  Altoid? 
JIM:  And Dwight. 
JIM:  And this is Dunder-Mifflin. 
JIM:  Andy! Nah, that's too far. 
JIM:  Andy... 
JIM:  Andy? 
JIM:  Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I. 
JIM:  Are there any messages? 
JIM:  Are you cool to just hang out? 
JIM:  Are you serious? 
JIM:  A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... 
JIM:  Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.  Ryan 
JIM:  Call you right back. What were you saying? 
JIM:  Can I call you right back? Thank you very much.  Okay.  What is this? 
JIM:  Can I do something for ya? 
JIM:  Can I talk to you a second? 
JIM:  Can I talk to you for a second? 
JIM:  Can you clap! Can you clap for mom? 
JIM:  Cleaning people. Oscar.  OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us. 
JIM:  Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever. 
JIM:  C'mon! 
JIM:  Come on. 
JIM:  Congratulations, buddy. 
JIM:  Didn't think you'd notice... 
JIM:  Doing great, push again. 
JIM:  Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest. 
JIM:  Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! 
JIM:  Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet. 
JIM:  Dwight, want an Altoid? 
JIM:  Dwight, what are you doing? 
JIM:  Dwight, you brought the mallard back. 
JIM:  Dwight. 
JIM:  Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture  of who you think deserv-- who's that?  
JIM:  Eleven months. 
JIM:  Ew. 
JIM:  Excuse me, one second. Hi. 
JIM:  fi-i-i-ine! 
JIM:  Four hundred and ninety-four months? 
JIM:  Frank and Beans.  Always makes her laugh. 
JIM:  Go ahead David, I m listening. 
JIM:  Good afternoon!  
JIM:  Good. 
JIM:  Goodbye, Dwight. 
JIM:  Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA  Dash JH. 
JIM:  Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.  Ryan 
JIM:  Great. 
JIM:  Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye. 
JIM:  Gross. 
JIM:  He creeps me out.  But, I think he might be a genius. 
JIM:  He s running! 
JIM:  Hello, this is Dwight. 
JIM:  Hello, this is Dwight. 
JIM:  Here he comes, shhh... 
JIM:  Here you go. All done. 
JIM:  He's alright. 
JIM:  Hey David, how would you like a guy who s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia? 
JIM:  Hey Pam, can I see you for a second? So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day. So he generously offered to wash our car. 
JIM:  Hey! 
JIM:  Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us. 
JIM:  Hey! Where you at, Filippelli? 
JIM:  Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now. 
JIM:  Hey, Brenda. This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat. And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? Um, so gimme a call back. You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Uh... give me a call back, I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye. 
JIM:  Hey, Brian. 
JIM:  Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a... 
JIM:  Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely. 
JIM:  Hey, Dwight.  
JIM:  Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye.  Female 
JIM:  Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere.  
JIM:  Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs... 
JIM:  Hey. 
JIM:  Hey. 
JIM:  Hey. 
JIM:  Hey. 
JIM:  Hey. So, we saw a new billboard. 
JIM:  Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty. 
JIM:  Hey... 
JIM:  Hey... 
JIM:  Hi buddy. 
JIM:  Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta? 
JIM:  Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model. 
JIM:  Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back.  Shut up . 
JIM:  Hi. 
JIM:  Hi.  All right. Travel safe, Angela. 
JIM:  Hold on a second.  The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about  
JIM:  How are ya? 
JIM:  How are your feet? 
JIM:  Huh. This is a little out of left field. 
JIM:  I am Popeye! 
JIM:  I can feel you looking at me. 
JIM:  I don't even know who you are anymore. 
JIM:  I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking. 
JIM:  I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip. 
JIM:  I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries. 
JIM:  I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season. 
JIM:  I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out? 
JIM:  I know, I do. 
JIM:  I stole this.  For you babe. 
JIM:  I suppose I am. 
JIM:  I think those might be empty. 
JIM:  I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records? 
JIM:  I will raise.  Thanks. 
JIM:  I will see you, tomorrow at lunch. 
JIM:  I... will never say a word. And now, we are even. 
JIM:  If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then. 
JIM:  I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes. 
JIM:  I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out. 
JIM:  I'm so sorry for all of this. 
JIM:  I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt. 
JIM:  I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head. 
JIM:  I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place. 
JIM:  Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters. 
JIM:  Is it? 
JIM:  Is that my phone? 
JIM:  Is that Nellie? 
JIM:  Is this his house? 
JIM:  Is this yours or mine? 
JIM:  Islands in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we be wrong? Sail away with me... 
JIM:  It involves you too. 
JIM:  It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation. Divided, together, uh huh. Making love with each other, uh huh. 
JIM:  It s called Ghostbusters. 
JIM:  It's going really well, actually. 
JIM:  It's kind of blurry.  That's better.  Question. What kind of bear is best? 
JIM:  It's like The Hurt Locker! 
JIM:  It's mine. Don't worry. 
JIM:  It's the four of hearts. 
JIM:  Jim Halpert. 
JIM:  Jim Halpert. 
JIM:  John Stamos. 
JIM:  Just  so weird. 
JIM:  Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible. 
JIM:  Just you know politics, literature. 
JIM:  Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow. 
JIM:  Let me get that for you. 
JIM:  Let s go outside 
JIM:  Lincoln. 
JIM:  Look at that. 
JIM:  Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me, 
JIM:  Margaret? 
JIM:  Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.  Ryan 
JIM:  Michael Scott here. 
JIM:  Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset? 
JIM:  Mint Dwight? 
JIM:  Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really. 
JIM:  Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you. 
JIM:  Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye. 
JIM:  Nice effort. 
JIM:  Nice to meet you. 
JIM:  Nice. 
JIM:  No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home. 
JIM:  No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the...  
JIM:  Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper. 
JIM:  Now what? 
JIM:  Of course 
JIM:  Oh God. 
JIM:  Oh man. Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff. So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or... 
JIM:  Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall. 
JIM:  Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it.  Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out.  He said it should just be under an hour, so...  we did it. 
JIM:  Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay.  
JIM:  OH! 
JIM:  Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one. 
JIM:  Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah... 
JIM:  Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one! 
JIM:  Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I- 
JIM:  Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to- 
JIM:  Oh, I know this guy.  Hello! Mr. "Soo-ven-yay." Mr. "Jacques Soo-ven-yay." Nice to meet you. It says here you're French.  So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
JIM:  Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy in the box, Creed. 
JIM:  Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach? 
JIM:  Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go. 
JIM:  Oh, no, not while I'm here. 
JIM:  Oh, ok. 
JIM:  Oh, Roy. 
JIM:  Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure. 
JIM:  Oh, what's this? 
JIM:  Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents. 
JIM:  Oh. 
JIM:  Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.  Creed. I was never here, all right? 
JIM:  Oh. Wow. 
JIM:  Oh... Deshaun Williams. 
JIM:  Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God.  One second. Oh... 
JIM:  Ohhhh! 
JIM:  Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies. 
JIM:  Ok, your turn. 
JIM:  OK. 
JIM:  OK. Here ya go.  
JIM:  Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals. 
JIM:  Okay, I thought I saw people missing. 
JIM:  Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They re going to make you pay for the fish, and  they wanted to know when you can start. 
JIM:  Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop! 
JIM:  Okay. That's vivid. 
JIM:  Okay... 
JIM:  Okay? 
JIM:  Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand. 
JIM:  Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma s got breakfast, OK?  We are going to Roy s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife s ex-fianc s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it s your wife s ex-fianc . 
JIM:  Pie! Pie! Pie! 
JIM:  Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up. 
JIM:  Please stop that! 
JIM:  Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces? 
JIM:  Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed. 
JIM:  Really? 
JIM:  Really? 
JIM:  Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam? 
JIM:  Right to voicemail.  Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck!  
JIM:  Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second... 
JIM:  Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow! 
JIM:  Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months... 
JIM:  Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets. 
JIM:  Robert, Hey!  Exclamation point. 
JIM:  See these forms... 
JIM:  See, now you don t owe me anything. 
JIM:  Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher. 
JIM:  Shel Silverstein. 
JIM:  So close. 
JIM:  So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big. 
JIM:  So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right? 
JIM:  So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh? 
JIM:  So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day. 
JIM:  So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually. 
JIM:  So that's what this sound is all day. 
JIM:  So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, "What's going on?" Well, you're not alone. 
JIM:  So, they know. 
JIM:  So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view.  
JIM:  So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate  So it's a tradeoff. 
JIM:  So... how do you guys know each other? 
JIM:  Sorry about that. 
JIM:  Sorry. 
JIM:  Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.  
JIM:  Spinning would be more fun. 
JIM:  Stop, stop, stop, stop. 
JIM:  Sure, I can hold. 
JIM:  Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it. 
JIM:  Thank you. 
JIM:  Thank you. 
JIM:  Thank you. 
JIM:  Thank you.  
JIM:  Thank you.  The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls. 
JIM:  Thanks again by the way. 
JIM:  Thanks Dwight. 
JIM:  That didn't happen. You would've told me right away. 
JIM:  That is pretty cool. 
JIM:  That Pam's pregnant. 
JIM:  That s a lot of pros. 
JIM:  That's a good point. 
JIM:  That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh! 
JIM:  That's fine, it's great! 
JIM:  That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on. 
JIM:  the closer I am to fi-i-i-ne. The closer I am to.. 
JIM:  The friendships. 
JIM:  the less I seek my source... 
JIM:  There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what? 
JIM:  There you go. 
JIM:  There you go. Thanks. 
JIM:  There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line 
JIM:  This is Dwight. 
JIM:  This is Jim Halpert, leave a message. 
JIM:  This one's a map. 
JIM:  This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something. 
JIM:  Tied up. 
JIM:  Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.  Ryan 
JIM:  Told you. 
JIM: - two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee. 
JIM:  Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative" and "assistant." 
JIM:  Uh yeah. Trust me, I d rather be with you guys. Business 
JIM:  Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece? 
JIM:  Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye. 
JIM:  Um, ok.  
JIM:  Um, you know what? I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell. Business 
JIM:  Um... Hey. 
JIM:  Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! 
JIM:  Volunteer duty. 
JIM:  Wait for it. 
JIM:  Wait, are we playing teams? 
JIM:  Wait, you're going up there? 
JIM:  Wait. 
JIM:  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen. 
JIM:  We made that. 
JIM:  We'll see.  This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me. 
JIM:  Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you.  That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy. 
JIM:  Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool. 
JIM:  Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started.  
JIM:  Well, what does Roy think about everything? 
JIM:  We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work. 
JIM:  What about an energy drink or something? 
JIM:  What are you doing? No. No, no, no. 
JIM:  What are you up to? Oops look out!  
JIM:  What does 2005 season mean? 
JIM:  What the hell? 
JIM:  What was that... 
JIM:  What? 
JIM:  What? 
JIM:  What? 
JIM:  What? 
JIM:  What? 
JIM:  What?  Oh, man! I'm sorry about that. 
JIM:  Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you! 
JIM:  What's that? Oh, uh, great. You know? I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a  energy... New York has, uh... Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  So that's a... bonus. 
JIM:  What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day? 
JIM:  When's the last time you upgraded your printer? 
JIM:  Whether it's this time or next time. 
JIM:  Who is this guy? We are killing it. 
JIM:  Who wants a hot chocolate? 
JIM:  Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though. 
JIM:  Who's that? 
JIM:  Why are you nodding? 
JIM:  Why is Packer back? 
JIM:  Will you stop? 
JIM:  Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step.  Yes! 
JIM:  Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole. 
JIM:  Wow, that is really interesting. 
JIM:  Wow. 
JIM:  Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good. 
JIM:  Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this. 
JIM:  Yeah, alright Kev.  
JIM:  Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl? 
JIM:  Yeah, that's right. 
JIM:  Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels. 
JIM:  Yeah. Andy and 
JIM:  Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you. 
JIM:  Yep, I did say that. 
JIM:  Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it. 
JIM:  Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up. 
JIM:  Yes. 
JIM:  You can...  You can do it Ryan. 
JIM:  You got it. 
JIM:  You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there. 
JIM:  You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that. 
JIM:  You have to stop this. 
JIM:  You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff. 
JIM:  You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know? 
JIM:  You sound tired. Everything ok? 
JIM:  You want a giraffe? 
JIM:  You win.  How good did that feel? 
JIM:  Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here? Fred 
JIM:  You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it.  
JIM:  You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs. 
JIM:  You're welcome. 
JIM: "And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green." 
JIM: "Good luck." 
JIM: "It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask." 
JIM: "My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with." 
JIM: "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies." 
JIM: "This rundown better be really good"? 
JIM: "Till Death Do Us Rock." 
JIM: "Uh, can you get this rundown for me?"   
JIM: ... MICHAEL! 
JIM: ... Yes. 
JIM: ...Absolutely you should. 
JIM: ...and finds the... fake grail? No grail? 
JIM: ...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you. 
JIM: ...and paper. 
JIM: ...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him. 
JIM: ...in your condo complex. 
JIM: ...It's something to think about. 
JIM: ...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but... 
JIM: ...Okay I can't... help you... with that. 
JIM: ...Okay. Office 
JIM: ...Right. Spin-serve!  
JIM: ...talk about it. 
JIM: ...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales. 
JIM: ...which I guess I'll be taking. 
JIM: : Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ... 
JIM: 1. Here we go!  
JIM: 117 Mount Bergin St. 
JIM: 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in? 
JIM: 19.  I had a really hard work out this morning. 
JIM: 5 dollars. 
JIM: 65. Ok, no need to laugh. 
JIM: 985,000,000,000,017. 
JIM: A- ah-- 
JIM: A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right? 
JIM: A costume? 
JIM: A formal warning...  
JIM: A futon? 
JIM: A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now? 
JIM: A little bit. ... Worth it. 
JIM: A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn.  Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface? 
JIM: A place? 
JIM: A really awesome baby. 
JIM: A small blonde woman? 
JIM: A toast, better make it good. To avoiding a class two felony charge.

JIM: Absolutely correct. 
JIM: Absolutely not, I'm mad at you. 
JIM: Absolutely not. 
JIM: Absolutely not. 
JIM: Absolutely not. 
JIM: Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.

JIM: Absolutely, I will do that right now. 
JIM: Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred. 
JIM: Absolutely, will do.

JIM: Absolutely. School 
JIM: Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately. 
JIM: Absolutely. Yeah.  Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me. 
JIM: Actually here for something else. 
JIM: Actually it sounds like you are. 
JIM: Actually not. It was really so-so. 
JIM: Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance. 
JIM: Actually, we've been dating for a couple months. 
JIM: Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome. 
JIM: Actually, yeah. 
JIM: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah. 
JIM: Actually, you didn't. 
JIM: After you sir.

JIM: Ah, you know me too well. 
JIM: Ah. 
JIM: Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them. 
JIM: Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea? 
JIM: Ah. You brought in your doll collection. 
JIM: Ah... I'm gonna s-  
JIM: Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?

JIM: Ahhh. 
JIM: Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do.  Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.

JIM: Alright, alright. And you are totally serious? 
JIM: Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker. And a great number two for the office. 
JIM: Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.

JIM: Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam. 
JIM: Alright, let me turn on some music.

JIM: Alright. 
JIM: Alright. 
JIM: Alright.  
JIM: Alright.  
JIM: Alright.  Excuse me. I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal... 
JIM: Alright.  Oh, did you see my memo by the way? 
JIM: Alright.  Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this? 
JIM: Alright. Great. Thank you. 
JIM: Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back. 
JIM: Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming. 
JIM: Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second. 
JIM: Alright. I will definitely do that. 
JIM: Alright. I'll tell everybody here that you say hi. 
JIM: Alright. Let's clear this up.  Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem? 
JIM: Alright. Let's get started. 
JIM: Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving. 
JIM: Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls? 
JIM: Alright. So, tell me all about it. 
JIM: Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it. 
JIM: Alright. Time to go. Okay. 
JIM: Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing? 
JIM: Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes. 
JIM: Alright. Why don't you just- 
JIM: Alright... 
JIM: Alright... Hey, did you change? 
JIM: Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease. 
JIM: Also good. 
JIM: Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see? 
JIM: Am I going down a road? 
JIM: Am I the only one that s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed? 
JIM: Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy. 
JIM: Am I walking out? 
JIM: Amazing. How do I look? 
JIM: An Altima or better. 
JIM: An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right? 
JIM: An Earl Grey tea for the lady. 
JIM: An urban thing... 
JIM: And a dart board. 
JIM: And a man. 
JIM: And a shower. 
JIM: And as you know, I was a paper salesman.  Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked.  
JIM: And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite. Front Desk 
JIM: And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese. 
JIM: And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back. 
JIM: And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal. 
JIM: And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear. 
JIM: And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar. 
JIM: And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me. 
JIM: And how many kitchens? 
JIM: And how many would you like? 
JIM: And I am always busy. 
JIM: And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want. 
JIM: And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it. 
JIM: And I don't support her choice to hit you. 
JIM: And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.  
JIM: And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that. 
JIM: And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you. Sensei 
JIM: And I have started a business in Philadelphia.  Oscar's 
JIM: and I m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right? 
JIM: And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, here's a way." 
JIM: And I took it right back. It was like... 
JIM: And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there? 
JIM: And I was still just a paper salesman. 
JIM: And I won't. 
JIM: And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand.  Can I get you some punch? 
JIM: And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now. 
JIM: And I'm telling you, I don't. 
JIM: And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um-- 
JIM: And impressions! 
JIM: And in this case... 
JIM: And Jim will say nothing. 
JIM: And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it. 
JIM: And of course, classy. 
JIM: And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it. 
JIM: And say what? "Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?" 
JIM: And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean. 
JIM: And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it. 
JIM: And stuff... yeah. 
JIM: And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself. 
JIM: And that isn't weird? 
JIM: And that's all? 
JIM: And that's noon. Exactly.  
JIM: And that's not the same. 
JIM: And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her. 
JIM: And that's what I told him. 
JIM: And that's when I knew. You? 
JIM: And the desk. 
JIM: And the final clue... 
JIM: And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to "Happy Birthday." And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault. 
JIM: And then an older gentleman asked you "Boxers or briefs?" 
JIM: And then compare. 
JIM: And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had.  
JIM: And then we checked the fax machine. 
JIM: And then you'll be saved. 
JIM: And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it. 
JIM: And there's my talking point. 
JIM: And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this? 
JIM: And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will. 
JIM: And we don't know how. 
JIM: And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  
JIM: And what Designing Woman are you basing that on? 
JIM: And what happens here is- 
JIM: And what happens in this one? 
JIM: And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two. 
JIM: And what's it's name? 
JIM: And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp. 
JIM: And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever?  
JIM: And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right? 
JIM: And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  
JIM: And you are not going to, either. 
JIM: And you didn't fail those things either. 
JIM: And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize. 
JIM: And you should. School 
JIM: And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right? 
JIM: And you'll be saved. 
JIM: And! 
JIM: And, also, any forms that you are going to need... 
JIM: And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down. 
JIM: And, um... 
JIM: And... ta da. 
JIM: And... that is why we waited so long to tell people. 
JIM: Andrew. 
JIM: Andy   this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It s just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you re our regional manager. And guess what man? You don t have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you don t believe me take a look at what s on my head. I m wearing a very pink hat. I ve been getting weird looks all day because I m pretty sure  DM does GB  means something kinda sexual. But guess who s wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That s huge. 
JIM: Andy--- Ohh... 
JIM: Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right. 
JIM: Andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent. Oh, and it is 6:00. 
JIM: Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward. 
JIM: Andy! 
JIM: Andy, are you all right? 
JIM: Andy, can I talk to you for a second? 
JIM: Andy, come on. 
JIM: Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug. 
JIM: Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this  
JIM: Andy, where are you? 
JIM: Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me . 
JIM: Andy, you've gotta be kidding me. 
JIM: Andy. 
JIM: Andy. 
JIM: Andy... is having a real rough day today. 
JIM: Andy? You all set? 
JIM: Angela, burger? Dog? Havin' fun? 
JIM: Angela, it s Halloween. You have to sing  Monster Mash . 
JIM: Angela. Nope. The ashes. 
JIM: Animation? All her by the way.  
JIM: Anna Maria's. 
JIM: Another round, boys? Great.   
JIM: Another worm? Like, are they friends? 
JIM: Any luck? 
JIM: Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it. 
JIM: Anybody could have walked in. 
JIM: Anything else? 
JIM: Anything would help. 
JIM: Anything. You got it. 
JIM: Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love. 
JIM: Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address? 
JIM: Are we even sure that's my file? 
JIM: Are we in danger? 
JIM: Are you a cocktail waitress? 
JIM: Are you alright? 
JIM: Are you interested in her? 
JIM: Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club? 
JIM: Are you kidding me? 
JIM: Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on! 
JIM: Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this. 
JIM: Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time? 
JIM: Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy. 
JIM: Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here. 
JIM: Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright? 
JIM: Are you okay? 
JIM: Are you really gonna marry him?  ...Ok. 
JIM: Are you really sure we should be leaving? Hospital 
JIM: Are you serious? 
JIM: Are you serious? 
JIM: Are you serious? 
JIM: Are you serious?  
JIM: Are you serious? Pam. 
JIM: Are you sure it doesn't hurt? 
JIM: Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you. 
JIM: Are you sure you can keep this under wraps? 
JIM: Are you sure you once knew how to do this? 
JIM: Are you sure you re okay with me putting in this much money. 
JIM: Are you sure? 
JIM: Are you... interested in her guy friends? 
JIM: Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican. 
JIM: As a hostage. 
JIM: As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now. 
JIM: Assistant regional manager, yeah. 
JIM: Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
JIM: Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool. 
JIM: At a gas station.  
JIM: At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me. 
JIM: At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus. 
JIM: At the Yankees game. Yeah. 
JIM: At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision. 
JIM: Athleap. 
JIM: Austin Powers. 
JIM: Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work. 
JIM: Aw, it's gonna be the   worst. 
JIM: Aw, man. 
JIM: Aw, thanks, man. 
JIM: Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint.  Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick? 
JIM: Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun. 
JIM: Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good. 
JIM: Awesome, right?  
JIM: Awesome. 
JIM: A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... 
JIM: A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... 
JIM: A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... 
JIM: Aww, best book? 
JIM: Aww, nuts.  
JIM: Aww. 
JIM: Aww... 
JIM: Awww, sorry. Did it break? 
JIM: Ayyyy! 
JIM: Back door. 
JIM: Baquette. 
JIM: Barely, I... I don't have all the facts. Frank and Bean... 
JIM: Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical. Ryan 
JIM: Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama. 
JIM: Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here. 
JIM: Bat birth control 
JIM: Be honest. 
JIM: Beardy? 
JIM: Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go.  
JIM: Because it is Halloween. So if you re going to sing a concert, it s a good idea to throw that one in. 
JIM: Because it's a surprise. 
JIM: Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts. 
JIM: Because my car broke down. 
JIM: Because not everybody knows about the party. 
JIM: Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging. 
JIM: Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping. 
JIM: Because the insurance company only covers two nights. 
JIM: Because we re friends. 
JIM: Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. 
JIM: Because you re sitting? 
JIM: Because you re sitting? 
JIM: Because you said "do you wanna hang out"- 
JIM: Because you've solved zero cases. 
JIM: Beesly! Oh, my god. 
JIM: Beesly, are you threatening me? 
JIM: Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman. 
JIM: Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column. 
JIM: Best Christmas ever. 
JIM: Best prank ever. 
JIM: Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup. 
JIM: Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right? 
JIM: Big day. 
JIM: Big day. 
JIM: Big Red Paper Company? Mr. 
JIM: Big tip. 
JIM: Billy Joel Rock Band. 
JIM: Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs. 
JIM: Birthday. 
JIM: Blonde. 
JIM: Boom!  
JIM: Both. They're both worse. 
JIM: Boy I--- 
JIM: Boyfriend. 
JIM: Brace yourself. 3  2  
JIM: Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think... 
JIM: Bribery. Nice. 
JIM: Bring me players. 
JIM: Brown, shiny, painful bite. 
JIM: Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa? 
JIM: But .. 
JIM: But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are. 
JIM: But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning. 
JIM: But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover. 
JIM: But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter. 
JIM: But he did, right? 
JIM: But I think it s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea .which, by the way, I can t wait for. 
JIM: But if not, there's always the army. The infantry. 
JIM: But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program. 
JIM: But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good. 
JIM: But it s Dwight who s bring in all the weirdos. 
JIM: But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away. 
JIM: But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table. 
JIM: But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake. 
JIM: But that doesn t matter. This does. It s the only thing that matters. We ve had some really nice days together. 
JIM: But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael? 
JIM: But there is a reason why I'm here! 
JIM: But there's definitely a desk open in the back. 
JIM: But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon. 
JIM: But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager? 
JIM: But what are you gonna do about that? 
JIM: But what have you learned about her? 
JIM: But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago. 
JIM: But you didn't fail. 
JIM: But you hear the baby crying, right? Hospital 
JIM: But you just met her. 
JIM: But you know I wouldn t hire any of these all-stars. 
JIM: But you re saying there s a chance. 
JIM: But you said that you went out with her this weekend. 
JIM: But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus. 
JIM: But you're leaving... 
JIM: But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit. 
JIM: But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes. 
JIM: But, what if? 
JIM: But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help. 
JIM: By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me. 
JIM: By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night? 
JIM: By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus? 
JIM: By the way, man, this place is... beautiful. 
JIM: By the way, they do need an extra day next week. 
JIM: Bye, Dwight. 
JIM: Bye. 
JIM: Bye. 
JIM: Bye. 
JIM: Bye. 
JIM: Bye. 
JIM: Bye. 
JIM: Bye.  Yep. See, you ve still got to press  End,  Pam. 
JIM: Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-...  
JIM: Caleb! 
JIM: Call me when you get in.   
JIM: Can I address that? 
JIM: Can I ask why you're leaving your current job? 
JIM: Can I change rooms? 
JIM: Can I get a drink? 
JIM: Can I get a drink? 
JIM: Can I go? 
JIM: Can I have a late checkout? 
JIM: Can I have a raise? 
JIM: Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike. 
JIM: Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks. 
JIM: Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly. 
JIM: Can I just talk to you for a second? 
JIM: Can I just talk to you for one quick second? 
JIM: Can I talk to you in my office for a second? 
JIM: Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad? 
JIM: Can we not? 
JIM: Can you figure out how to upload Cece s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up. 
JIM: Can you give us a hint? 
JIM: Can you grow up? 
JIM: Can you...  You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate? 
JIM: Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy. 
JIM: Can't believe no ones thought of that. 
JIM: Can't do that. 
JIM: Can't do that. Unsanitary. 
JIM: Can't wait. 
JIM: Can't you do something about this? 
JIM: Captain Crunch. 
JIM: Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win. 
JIM: Careful. There is no inner circle. 
JIM: Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there. 
JIM: Catching butterflies. 
JIM: Cathy, go. 
JIM: Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal.  I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon. 
JIM: 'cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day. 
JIM: Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared. 
JIM: Cause there was dinner, by candlelight. 
JIM: Cece s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I ve been working with her on her move. It s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It s kind of like this. It s pretty cute, right? 
JIM: Cece s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models. 
JIM: Cece! 
JIM: Challenge number two, protocol. Clark? 
JIM: Chapter 
JIM: Chapter 2   Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present. 
JIM: Chapter 4   One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon. 
JIM: Chapter 9   The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party. 
JIM: Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients. 
JIM: Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically?   I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that. 
JIM: Check this out though, spin serve.  Well, it works like 80% of the time, so... 
JIM: Cheer up. We made a sale. 
JIM: Chicken, hot dog, burger. 
JIM: Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black? 
JIM: Classic. 
JIM: Close. 
JIM: Closing ceremonies. 
JIM: Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot. 
JIM: College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight) 
JIM: Co-manager, actually. 
JIM: Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one. Voice on CD 
JIM: Come on Dwight! Use words. 
JIM: Come on Dwight.  
JIM: Come on man, just give it a couple days. I think you'll be all right. 
JIM: Come on, Gabe, you can t handle his hamstrings. You re getting hypno-thigh-zed. 
JIM: Come on, get inside. 
JIM: Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down. 
JIM: Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck. 
JIM: Come on, man. 
JIM: Come on, man. 
JIM: Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes. 
JIM: Come on, Michael says we should go now. 
JIM: Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how. 
JIM: Come on, who doesn't like a picnic? 
JIM: Come on. 
JIM: Come on. 
JIM: Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want. 
JIM: Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be more than that. 
JIM: Come on. Jim & 
JIM: Competent. 
JIM: Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year. 
JIM: Concussion.  What did you write? 
JIM: Conference room everyone. 
JIM: Congratulations! 
JIM: Cons, Ryan. He defrauded the company. He has never made a sale. 
JIM: Cool. 
JIM: Cool. 
JIM: Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight. 
JIM: Cool. Thanks.  
JIM: Copy that. 
JIM: Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes. 
JIM: Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right. Todd 
JIM: Could go either way. 
JIM: Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff. 
JIM: Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta? 
JIM: Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam? 
JIM: Could you please keep it down?  I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid.  
JIM: Could, keep that down. 
JIM: Couple of times. 
JIM: Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it? 
JIM: Courtside seats. Sixers. 
JIM: Crying? 
JIM: Cryogenics. Beer me five. 
JIM: Cugino's pizza. 
JIM: Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that. 
JIM: Cute, sure, yeah. 
JIM: Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right? Mr. 
JIM: Damn it guys! 
JIM: Damn it. 
JIM: Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again.  Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid? 
JIM: Damn. 
JIM: Darn it! 
JIM: Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys.  Nellie 
JIM: Darryl, it doesn t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make. 
JIM: Dave. 
JIM: Dave. 
JIM: Dave. 
JIM: David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out. 
JIM: David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work. David 
JIM: De class�. 
JIM: Dead goose. 
JIM: Definitely Grandma. 
JIM: Definitely not. If anything it was a tie. 
JIM: Definitely not. That's disgusting. 
JIM: Definitely we should. 
JIM: Definitely. 
JIM: Definitely. 
JIM: Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped. 
JIM: Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton? 
JIM: Did I? I don't... 
JIM: Did it! 
JIM: Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you. 
JIM: Did my scores drop a little? 
JIM: Did something happen Dwight? 
JIM: Did that really need to be said? 
JIM: Did they? 
JIM: Did ya? 
JIM: Did you break the shredder Kevin? 
JIM: Did you cry? 
JIM: Did you ever see that movie? 
JIM: Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children? 
JIM: Did you feel like crying? 
JIM: Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on. 
JIM: Did you just say you remember him? 
JIM: Did you just trademark that... 
JIM: Did you murder someone? 
JIM: Did you really? 
JIM: Did you say "she?" 
JIM: Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people? 
JIM: Didn't I? 
JIM: Didn't we kind of start it? 
JIM: Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis! 
JIM: Ding Dong. 
JIM: Ding dong. 
JIM: Ding dong. 
JIM: Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie.  And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date. 
JIM: DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight. 
JIM: Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding?  
JIM: Do I? 
JIM: Do it. 
JIM: Do Snowboarders hate animals? 
JIM: Do they call you that? 
JIM: Do we all have our copy of "Threat 
JIM: Do we have a conversation scheduled? 
JIM: Do ya? 
JIM: Do you even know what that means? 
JIM: Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me? 
JIM: Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life. 
JIM: Do you know the industry is in decline? 
JIM: Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink? 
JIM: Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll? 
JIM: Do you need us for any of this? 
JIM: Do you really have to do that right now? 
JIM: Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk? 
JIM: Do you run the bed and breakfest? 
JIM: Do you take requests? 
JIM: Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today? 
JIM: Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation? 
JIM: Do you want a corn dog? 
JIM: Do you want to go play on the table upstairs? 
JIM: Do you want to play- 
JIM: Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game. 
JIM: Do you? 
JIM: Do you? 
JIM: Does he ever. 
JIM: Does it save time though?  Cause we ve been here for about an hour. 
JIM: Does Mose have nightmares? 
JIM: Does my room have cable? 
JIM: Does that include 'That's What She Said'? 
JIM: Does the Department of Health know about this? 
JIM: Doesn t seem like anyone cares about us anyway. 
JIM: Doesn't it? 
JIM: Doesn't matter what the name is. Se or Loadenstein, that's stupid. 
JIM: Doesn't matter. 
JIM: Don t-- don t-- don t pole people with knives. 
JIM: Don t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus. 
JIM: Done, right? 
JIM: Done. 
JIM: Done. Explain. 
JIM: Don't- 
JIM: Don't beat yourself up. 
JIM: Don't call her "the mom." 
JIM: Don't do that. 
JIM: Don't open your eyes. 
JIM: Don't take it. 
JIM: Don't think you need the corpse then. 
JIM: Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try. 
JIM: Don't. 
JIM: Don't.  I have information about the sex predator. 
JIM: Don't. Stop, Dwight!  Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop! 
JIM: Don't.. 
JIM: Don't.. 
JIM: Don't... 
JIM: Dragging sticks. 
JIM: Dragging. 
JIM: Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him. 
JIM: Duh. 
JIM: Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim. 
JIM: DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Yes! Meredith? 
JIM: Dwight- 
JIM: Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot. 
JIM: Dwight come on, come- 
JIM: Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger.  We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours. 
JIM: Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight only good surprises.  Guten Pranken .  
JIM: Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India. 
JIM: Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset. 
JIM: Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink. 
JIM: Dwight says "Hi." 
JIM: Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks. 
JIM: Dwight tried to kiss me. 
JIM: Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so... 
JIM: Dwight! 
JIM: Dwight! 
JIM: Dwight! 
JIM: Dwight! 
JIM: Dwight! 
JIM: Dwight!  Why? 
JIM: Dwight! Are your legs broken? 
JIM: Dwight! At least aim it. 
JIM: Dwight! Dwight! 
JIM: Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice? 
JIM: Dwight, 
JIM: Dwight, come o- 
JIM: Dwight, come on. Don t end on a bad note. 
JIM: Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work. 
JIM: Dwight, don't be gross. 
JIM: Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um  I don t know how to tell you this, but  we have a little bit of a problem. 
JIM: Dwight, he's gonna kill the store. 
JIM: Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson. 
JIM: Dwight, how's the hotel business? 
JIM: Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore.   
JIM: Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding. 
JIM: Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit... 
JIM: Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us? 
JIM: Dwight, let me see your coffee cup. 
JIM: Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please? 
JIM: Dwight, please. 
JIM: Dwight, please. 
JIM: Dwight, question. 
JIM: Dwight, should she be our manager? 
JIM: Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant. 
JIM: Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ? 
JIM: Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while? 
JIM: Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours. 
JIM: Dwight, you can t just hire someone  cause they re your friend. 
JIM: Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife! 
JIM: Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time? 
JIM: Dwight. 
JIM: Dwight. Dwight. 
JIM: Dwight. Dwight.   
JIM: Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go? 
JIM: Dwight. This,   fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons? 
JIM: Dwight... 
JIM: Dwight? 
JIM: Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing- 
JIM: Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard. 
JIM: Easy. 
JIM: Easy. 
JIM: Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that goin'. 
JIM: Eh, she's nice, I guess. You know what? Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list. 
JIM: Eight months? 
JIM: Either way, Dwight  I can t be there for you. I m sorry. 
JIM: Elaborate. 
JIM: Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something. 
JIM: Enjoy, enjoy. 
JIM: Erin. 
JIM: Essential. 
JIM: Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind. 
JIM: Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything. 
JIM: Every time there's a silence, your brain's like "Heh-heh-huh-huh" . 
JIM: Everybody's birthday. 
JIM: Everyone knew some of it. 
JIM: Everything is going to be ok. 
JIM: Everything's fine. 
JIM: Ew, the exact opposite, actually. 
JIM: Eww. 
JIM: Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do. 
JIM: Exactly. 
JIM: Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it. 
JIM: Exactly. It happened in Big. 
JIM: Exactly. You can do this. 
JIM: Excellent. Go for it. 
JIM: Except pass that breathalyzer. 
JIM: Excuse me. 
JIM: Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two? 
JIM: Excuse me? 
JIM: Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica. 
JIM: Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton. 
JIM: Fair enough. 
JIM: Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago. 
JIM: Fair question. 
JIM: False. Black bear. 
JIM: Fantastic. 
JIM: Fantastic. 
JIM: Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast. 
JIM: Feel better? 
JIM: Ferris Bueller. 
JIM: Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents... 
JIM: Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15. 
JIM: Fine. 
JIM: Fine. 
JIM: Fine. Party pooper. 
JIM: Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good. 
JIM: Fireball! 
JIM: First of all, hi. 
JIM: Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping. 
JIM: Five movies. Go ahead. 
JIM: Five tickets on the windshield... Hey. 
JIM: Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops. 
JIM: Flooded. 
JIM: Flowers. 
JIM: fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me, 
JIM: For a lot of reasons. 
JIM: For me, it was. 
JIM: For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here... 
JIM: For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin  
JIM: For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do. 
JIM: For this? 
JIM: For what? 
JIM: Forget it. 
JIM: Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it. 
JIM: Forward, definitely. 
JIM: Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just... 
JIM: Four months. 
JIM: Four months. 
JIM: Frank and beans! 
JIM: 'Free paper.' 
JIM: Frisbee-based competitions... 
JIM: Funny? No? Nobody laughing? 
JIM: Get in the car?  
JIM: Get out. 
JIM: Get up. 
JIM: Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by. 
JIM: Gettin  a lot of mileage out of this, aren t ya? 
JIM: Gettin  psyched up? 
JIM: Getting my wife a week off from work. 
JIM: Gimme a break. 
JIM: -give him to me and... perfect. 
JIM: Give the bottle to Michael  
JIM: Give the bottle to Michael! 
JIM: Glass of water would be a start. 
JIM: Go bag's in the car... Keys, my keys, where's my keys? 
JIM: Go crazy. 
JIM: Go get 'em. 
JIM: Go get 'em. 
JIM: Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me 
JIM: Go! Go! Go! 
JIM: Go. 
JIM: God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart.  
JIM: God! 
JIM: God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well. 
JIM: God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um... 
JIM: God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this? 
JIM: Good advice Beesley. Thanks. See you out there. 
JIM: Good game Meredith. 
JIM: Good Lord!  I can't believe I'm missing this. 
JIM: Good luck.  
JIM: Good morning.  Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns. 
JIM: Good night, Dwight.  Co-Worker 
JIM: Good night. 
JIM: Good one. 
JIM: Good one. 
JIM: Good one. 
JIM: Good to see you, too. 
JIM: Good to see you. 
JIM: Good! 
JIM: Good! 
JIM: Good! What's goin' on here? 
JIM: Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou. 
JIM: Good, how are you? 
JIM: Good, right? Hello. 
JIM: Good. 
JIM: Good. 
JIM: Good. 
JIM: Good. 
JIM: Good. 
JIM: Good. Cause I have a lot of questions. 
JIM: Good. Good. 
JIM: Good. Please hurry. 
JIM: Good. What? Nothin' 
JIM: Good-bye. 
JIM: Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela. 
JIM: Goodnight, Michael. 
JIM: Gosh. 
JIM: Got it. 
JIM: Got it. 
JIM: Got it. 
JIM: Got it. 
JIM: Got to be kidding me. 
JIM: Gotcha. 
JIM: Gotcha. Alright. 
JIM: Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who s excited? 
JIM: Gravel company? 
JIM: Great work Dwight. 
JIM: Great! 
JIM: Great! 
JIM: Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips. 
JIM: Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or... 
JIM: Great, yeah, good. 
JIM: Great. 
JIM: Great. 
JIM: Great. 
JIM: Great. 
JIM: Great. 
JIM: Great. 
JIM: Great.  
JIM: Great.  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised- 
JIM: Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael? 
JIM: Great. Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program? 
JIM: Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled. 
JIM: Great. Let me just... 
JIM: Great. See ya' then. 
JIM: Great. See you upstairs. 
JIM: Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you. 
JIM: Great. What's new with you? 
JIM: Great. Where did you get it? 
JIM: Greatness is only skin deep, some people say... 
JIM: Gross! 
JIM: Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva? 
JIM: Guy's going by. Shh. 
JIM: Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy. 
JIM: Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score. 
JIM: Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work. 
JIM: Guys, the Afghanistananies. 
JIM: Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay? 
JIM: Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager. 
JIM: Guys, what is going on?!   
JIM: Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it. 
JIM: Ha ha ha. 
JIM: Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so-  
JIM: Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good. 
JIM: Ha ha. That's hilarious? 
JIM: Haaank. Is that you? 
JIM: Haha... 
JIM: Half hour. 
JIM: Half. 
JIM: Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas. 
JIM: Have a good game man. 
JIM: Have a good night. 
JIM: Have I not proposed to you, yet? 
JIM: Have you checked Trip Advisor recently? 
JIM: Have you ever seen a stripper before? 
JIM: Have you ever seen 'em do that?  
JIM: Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies  - that's just unfair. 
JIM: Having a great time. 
JIM: He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door? 
JIM: He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do? 
JIM: He definitely stole my iPod. 
JIM: He did pick a good one. 
JIM: He didn't text me.  
JIM: He does? 
JIM: He envies you. 
JIM: He has not stopped working for a second. At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible. At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports. And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work. It's exhausting, being this vigilant. I'll probably have to go home early today. 
JIM: He hit the pole! 
JIM: He just sent a text... 
JIM: He knows what he's doing. 
JIM: He never called a meeting. 
JIM: He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number  and then threw it in a bag. 
JIM: He plays piano? 
JIM: He s got a bank vault. That s a start. 
JIM: He welcomes you. 
JIM: He... It's a crime fighting beaver. 
JIM: Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous. 
JIM: Hello. 
JIM: Hello? 
JIM: Hello? 
JIM: Hello? 
JIM: Hello? 
JIM: Hello?   No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK.   
JIM: Hello? Hello? 
JIM: Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert. 
JIM: Here they come. 
JIM: Here we go. 
JIM: Here we go. 
JIM: Here we go.  
JIM: Here we go.   
JIM: Here we go. Here we go. 
JIM: Here we go... 
JIM: Here you go again! What is your deal today? 
JIM: Here you go.  
JIM: Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows. 
JIM: Here, you know what? You can have some nickels. 
JIM: Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen. 
JIM: Here's the thing. What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary. Because they're set up to do that kind of thing. 
JIM: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody. 
JIM: He's a grown man 
JIM: He's a jerk. 
JIM: He's a volunteer. 
JIM: He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser... 
JIM: He's fine. He's indestructible. 
JIM: He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with. 
JIM: He's good at his job. And I like working for him. 
JIM: He's just mad that we're all having fun. 
JIM: He's not a part of this. You know that. 
JIM: He's not a real candidate. 
JIM: He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash. 
JIM: He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper! 
JIM: He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me. 
JIM: He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him? 
JIM: Hey David. 
JIM: Hey dude, you know what a "rundown" is? 
JIM: Hey Dwight. 
JIM: Hey Dwight. 
JIM: Hey Dwight. 
JIM: Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it. Michael's 
JIM: Hey guys let s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he s never, ever going to go back on it right? 
JIM: Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk.  Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that? 
JIM: Hey guys, what're we talking about? 
JIM: Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit? 
JIM: Hey Helen. Is everything ok? 
JIM: Hey hey hey. Everything okay? 
JIM: Hey it s Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I ve read a lot about this really great documentary. 
JIM: Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok. 
JIM: Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay. 
JIM: Hey Karen. 
JIM: Hey Kelly. What's up? 
JIM: Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey? 
JIM: Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork? 
JIM: Hey man, good to see you. 
JIM: Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert. Ryan 
JIM: Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you. 
JIM: Hey man, you mind if I run something by you? 
JIM: Hey man. 
JIM: Hey man. 
JIM: Hey man.  
JIM: Hey man. I am so sorry about that. 
JIM: Hey Meredith, how you feelin'? 
JIM: Hey Michael. 
JIM: Hey New York, Happy Halloween! 
JIM: Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here. 
JIM: Hey Pam! How are you? 
JIM: Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe? 
JIM: Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good. 
JIM: Hey uh, Michael. Don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured. 
JIM: Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ? 
JIM: Hey! 
JIM: Hey! 
JIM: Hey! 
JIM: Hey! 
JIM: Hey! 
JIM: Hey! 
JIM: Hey!  I...  
JIM: Hey! Back here. 
JIM: Hey! Can I talk you? For a second? 
JIM: Hey! Hey! Hey! 
JIM: Hey! How are ya? I thought you left? 
JIM: Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you. 
JIM: Hey! Just in time! You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave. 
JIM: Hey! There she is.  How you doin? 
JIM: Hey! Welcome back! 
JIM: Hey! What the hell's goin' on? 
JIM: Hey, alright. 
JIM: Hey, Amy. How ya doing? 
JIM: Hey, and if you re ever in Austin... 
JIM: Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make. 
JIM: Hey, Andy. 
JIM: Hey, Andy. How are you, man? 
JIM: Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said- 
JIM: Hey, are you kidding me? 
JIM: Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies? 
JIM: Hey, can I talk to you for a second? 
JIM: Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second? 
JIM: Hey, can you go to IM? 
JIM: Hey, can't really talk now, what's up? 
JIM: Hey, come on. 
JIM: Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital. 
JIM: Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It s really great. 
JIM: Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player? 
JIM: Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine? 
JIM: Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal! 
JIM: Hey, Darryl.  
JIM: Hey, David. 
JIM: Hey, David. You got Jim here. 
JIM: Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece? 
JIM: Hey, do you guys have any other games? 
JIM: Hey, do you have a second? 
JIM: Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing? 
JIM: Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear. 
JIM: Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy. 
JIM: Hey, Dwight. 
JIM: Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist? 
JIM: Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever? 
JIM: Hey, Dwight. It's Jim. 
JIM: Hey, Dwight. What's up? 
JIM: Hey, easy, easy... 
JIM: Hey, grandma's back. 
JIM: Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby? 
JIM: Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today? 
JIM: Hey, hey, come on, language. 
JIM: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
JIM: Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal. 
JIM: Hey, hey. Okay. 
JIM: Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark. 
JIM: Hey, how are you and Darryl? 
JIM: Hey, how are you? 
JIM: Hey, how are you? 
JIM: Hey, how is... Toby? 
JIM: Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know. 
JIM: Hey, how'd the interview go? 
JIM: Hey, how's it goin'? 
JIM: Hey, how's it going? 
JIM: Hey, how's it going? 
JIM: Hey, how's things? 
JIM: Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea. 
JIM: Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office? 
JIM: Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement. 
JIM: Hey, I m in Philadelphia right now. 
JIM: Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don t want to meet that person. 
JIM: Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy? 
JIM: Hey, it's snowing. 
JIM: Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing. 
JIM: Hey, Kelly, it's Jim. 
JIM: Hey, Kelly. 
JIM: Hey, Kev. 
JIM: Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally. 
JIM: Hey, man. 
JIM: Hey, man. It s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don t. I m in. Yeah, yep, I m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye.  Yeah! 
JIM: Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late. 
JIM: Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise. 
JIM: Hey, of course. 
JIM: Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter? 
JIM: Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now? 
JIM: Hey, quick 
JIM: Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof? 
JIM: Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook? 
JIM: Hey, Ryan. How's it going? 
JIM: Hey, Ryan? 
JIM: Hey, so how's the direct mail business going? 
JIM: Hey, so this isn t matching up with this and I m not sure which one s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me? 
JIM: Hey, sorry everybody. 
JIM: Hey, thanks a lot. 
JIM: Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale. 
JIM: Hey, Toby! 
JIM: Hey, Toby. 
JIM: Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question. 
JIM: Hey, uh David. 
JIM: Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it. 
JIM: Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van? 
JIM: Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer?  This guy! Todd 
JIM: Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her. 
JIM: Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about? 
JIM: Hey, whoa, Michael... 
JIM: Hey, who'd you end up hiring? 
JIM: Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you. 
JIM: Hey, you don't have to... 
JIM: Hey, you got a second? 
JIM: Hey, you got a second? 
JIM: Hey, you have a second? 
JIM: Hey, you know what? I got you a cake. 
JIM: Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok? 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey.

JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey.  
JIM: Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday. 
JIM: Hey. Doug : I'm Doug Mcpherson, Davey's uncle. 
JIM: Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or  
JIM: Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that. 
JIM: Hey. I was just about to call you. 
JIM: Hey. It is my business when it happens at work. 
JIM: Hey. It s nothing. Alright? I ll text you when we get there. Let you know what s going on. 
JIM: Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude. 
JIM: Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company. 
JIM: Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it? 
JIM: Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients. 
JIM: Hey. What's up? 
JIM: Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party. 
JIM: Hey...  
JIM: Hey...  
JIM: Hey... What? 
JIM: Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together. 
JIM: Hi David. 
JIM: Hi Katy, nice to meet you. 
JIM: Hi!   
JIM: Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up. 
JIM: Hi, David. 
JIM: Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here. 
JIM: Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents? 
JIM: Hi. 
JIM: Hi. 
JIM: Hi. 
JIM: Hi. 
JIM: Hi. 
JIM: Hi. How are ya? Good to see you. 
JIM: Hm hm. 
JIM: Hm. Really tough call. 
JIM: Hmm Heda.  No. 
JIM: Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this? 
JIM: Hmm, sounds risky. 
JIM: Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty. 
JIM: Hmm, what? 
JIM: Hmm. 
JIM: Hmm. Doubt it. 
JIM: Hmm... 
JIM: Hmm... 
JIM: Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter? 
JIM: Hmm? 
JIM: Hmm? No. 
JIM: Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope. 
JIM: Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6. 
JIM: Hmmm. 
JIM: Hold on one second. 
JIM: Hold on, hold on. Is this him? 
JIM: Hold on, just wanna get it on camera.  
JIM: Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice? 
JIM: Holly, will you marry me? 
JIM: Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we d save her from Ryan right? 
JIM: Honestly, I don't mind.  Did you want me to wash it for you or... 
JIM: Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma. 
JIM: Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues. 
JIM: How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.' 
JIM: How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case? 
JIM: How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it. 
JIM: How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this? 
JIM: How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential. 
JIM: How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second... 
JIM: How are things? 
JIM: How are we doing on contractions? 
JIM: How are you doing this? 
JIM: How are you, man? 
JIM: How are you? 
JIM: How are you? 
JIM: How can you even be sure? 
JIM: How dare you? My family built this country, by the way. 
JIM: How did those get out? I'm sorry. 
JIM: How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran. 
JIM: How do you feel? 
JIM: How do you hate it? It's a cake. 
JIM: How do you know it was me? 
JIM: How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments? 
JIM: How far away did you think we were? 
JIM: How is it my fault? 
JIM: How long is this?  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings. 
JIM: How many buttons do you have? 
JIM: How many L to a K? 
JIM: How many shoes do you need? 
JIM: How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job. 
JIM: How many words per minute does the average person type? 
JIM: How much did you pay for it? 
JIM: How much time do you have left on your break? 
JIM: How much weight have you lost, Dwight? 
JIM: How old are you? 
JIM: How so? 
JIM: How was your meeting with Michael? 
JIM: How would that work in well? I just want to know. 
JIM: How you doing? 
JIM: How? 
JIM: Howard Cline? 
JIM: How'd you get gum in your hair? 
JIM: How's it going, man? 
JIM: How's it going? 
JIM: How's that gonna help you? 
JIM: Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby? 
JIM: Huh. 
JIM: Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour? 
JIM: Huh. Well, you know, you can t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what s most important. That s my new thing. 
JIM: Hum. 
JIM: Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical. 
JIM: I  at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don't call again. 
JIM: I absolutely don't understand, either. 
JIM: I ain t fraid of no ghost.  Whoa! 
JIM: I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting. 
JIM: I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you. 
JIM: I am Bill Buttlicker. 
JIM: I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you? 
JIM: I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost? 
JIM: I am gonna need your advice  I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think? 
JIM: I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?  
JIM: I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking. 
JIM: I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos. 
JIM: I am not gonna do this. 
JIM: I am not kidding.  Got it a week after we started dating. 
JIM: I am not lying. 
JIM: I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working. 
JIM: I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two. 
JIM: I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything.  
JIM: I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-  
JIM: I am still in Philly, actually. 
JIM: I am working on it. 
JIM: I am, too. Let me show you. 
JIM: I am. 
JIM: I am. 
JIM: I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name. 
JIM: I bet I should.  That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you. 
JIM: I bet we would. 
JIM: I bet. 
JIM: I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it s good for the environment too. 
JIM: I bit my lip at lunch today. 
JIM: I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.   So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation.   Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.   This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so...   
JIM: I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it? 
JIM: I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her. 
JIM: I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody. 
JIM: I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door. 
JIM: I can also take 3 people. 
JIM: I can always kind of win at roulette. 
JIM: I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much.  Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto? Phyllis: Ask for Donald, Karen s bananas. 
JIM: I can imagine. 
JIM: I can see that. 
JIM: I can t. I have the thing. 
JIM: I can. 
JIM: I can't believe how bad this looks. 
JIM: I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork. 
JIM: I can't believe it was me. 
JIM: I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow. 
JIM: I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening. 
JIM: I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend. 
JIM: I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe. 
JIM: I can't hear you. 
JIM: I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second.  Excuse me.  
JIM: I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable. 
JIM: I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in. 
JIM: I can't. 
JIM: I can't. I just got a manicure. 
JIM: I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it. 
JIM: I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael.  What's so funny? I'm a co-manager. 
JIM: I closed it! 
JIM: I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace. 
JIM: I deserved that. 
JIM: I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened. 
JIM: I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else. 
JIM: I did not do this. 
JIM: I did not love the dialogue. Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless. 
JIM: I did not see this coming. 
JIM: I did, yeah. 
JIM: I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people. 
JIM: I did. It was inconclusive. 
JIM: I did... say that. 
JIM: I didn't ask you.  Would you like to talk?  
JIM: I didn't forget them, they're right here. 
JIM: I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened. 
JIM: I didn't sign anything. 
JIM: I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell? 
JIM: I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help. Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon. 
JIM: I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't. 
JIM: I didn't think you'd notice.   Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him. 
JIM: I didn't, I'll look somewhere else. 
JIM: I didn't... no. 
JIM: I disagree with. 
JIM: I disagree. 
JIM: I do remember, yeah. 
JIM: I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses. 
JIM: I don t even know where the stairs are! 
JIM: I don t know how else to tell you, okay? I m doing everything I can every week to bring home something... 
JIM: I don t know how else to tell you. 
JIM: I don t know what to tell you, man. 
JIM: I don t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I ve been faced with a tough decision, there s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation. 
JIM: I don t know, for such a crazy number I d like something pretty crazy. 
JIM: I don t know. He wasn t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn t hire his wife. 
JIM: I don t know. I ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you? 
JIM: I don t think it s- 
JIM: I don t. 
JIM: I don't- 
JIM: I don't care. 
JIM: I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore. 
JIM: I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future.  "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight." 
JIM: I don't know about Stephen King, I mean... 
JIM: I don't know about, love... 
JIM: I don't know because I everything I own is there. 
JIM: I don't know how we'd go about doing that. 
JIM: I don't know if I can. 
JIM: I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you! Michael 
JIM: I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room. 
JIM: I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but- 
JIM: I don't know what else we can do here. 
JIM: I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world. 
JIM: I don't know what you mean. 
JIM: I don't know what you're talking about. 
JIM: I don't know, dad. I don't know. 
JIM: I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again. 
JIM: I don't know, I don't know. 
JIM: I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out. 
JIM: I don't know, what?  
JIM: I don't know. 
JIM: I don't know.  Oh! That's... not... yours. 
JIM: I don't know. Feel like... Friday night crowds... 
JIM: I don't know. Grab a drink, I think? 
JIM: I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby? 
JIM: I don't know. I don't know. 
JIM: I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but... 
JIM: I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy. 
JIM: I don't know. Is it what you expected? 
JIM: I don't know. Let's break up. 
JIM: I don't know. This conversation really got away from me. 
JIM: I don't know. Where to begin? My ball. 
JIM: I don't like that. 
JIM: I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her. 
JIM: I don't really wanna picture it. But thank you, Pam. 
JIM: I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women. 
JIM: I don't think so. 
JIM: I don't think so. 
JIM: I don't think that's gonna... 
JIM: I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole.  
JIM: I don't think we need opposed. 
JIM: I don't think you had to. 
JIM: I don't think you understand - 
JIM: I don't think you're good at making tough decisions! 
JIM: I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan. You know that. 
JIM: I don't want to go. 
JIM: I don't! 
JIM: I don't... I don't think so. 
JIM: I doubt that they're sh- 
JIM: I dunno, it's on your desk. 
JIM: I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing? 
JIM: I forgot if there was an "e" between the "l" and the "y." I still don't know. 
JIM: I get back from work around 6. 
JIM: I get it. 
JIM: I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal.   Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there. 
JIM: I got it. 
JIM: I got it. Alright. 
JIM: I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea. 
JIM: I got this.  
JIM: I gotta get out of this dress. Carol 
JIM: I gotta go do this. 
JIM: I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him? 
JIM: I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much. 
JIM: I guess he can't get any girl he wants. 
JIM: I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing. 
JIM: I guess I will swallow my truth. 
JIM: I guess. 
JIM: I guess.  How dare you. 
JIM: I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars. 
JIM: I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp... 
JIM: I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer. 
JIM: I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt. 
JIM: I have a lot of work to do this afternoon. Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves. 
JIM: I have a surprise for you. All right, ready? Close your eyes and now   open your eyes. Tadah! 
JIM: I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip. 
JIM: I have been getting ready and then driving over here. 
JIM: I have new baby pictures. 
JIM: I have no idea where we re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks. 
JIM: I have no idea. 
JIM: I have no idea. We went right for the copier. 
JIM: I have nothing in common with Plop. 
JIM: I have nothing to do. 
JIM: I have noticed that we-- 
JIM: I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong. 
JIM: I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay. 
JIM: I haven t heard of it, obviously. But I m out because I am significantly younger than you- 
JIM: I hope not.  Because I am not going. Two question marks? 
JIM: I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one. 
JIM: I just- 
JIM: I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know. 
JIM: I just didn't, you know, want a deal. 
JIM: -I just don't know if I can do it. 
JIM: I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember. 
JIM: I just feel like we're gonna fight. 
JIM: I just got a text from Robert California that says  bring your clubs to Florida . 
JIM: I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office. 
JIM: I just need some time. 
JIM: I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision. 
JIM: I just needed you to know. Once. 
JIM: I just really wish there was something I could do.  
JIM: I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh... 
JIM: I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day. 
JIM: I just thought you should--- 
JIM: I just walked in on someone in the bathroom. 
JIM: I just want it to stop. 
JIM: I just wanted to say hi. 
JIM: I just-- what? 
JIM: I just... couldn't wait. 
JIM: I knew it, I knew it. 
JIM: I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh? 
JIM: I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin. 
JIM: I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow s his wedding day. You can t be anything but happy on your wedding day. 
JIM: I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton? 
JIM: I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes. 
JIM: I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates... 
JIM: I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok? 
JIM: I know why you're doing this, Dwight. 
JIM: I know! 
JIM: I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there. 
JIM: I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh. 
JIM: I know, I know. 
JIM: I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though. 
JIM: I know. 
JIM: I know. 
JIM: I know. 
JIM: I know. 
JIM: I know. 
JIM: I know. 
JIM: I know. 
JIM: I know.  Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads. 
JIM: I know. And I can t do it. 
JIM: I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work. 
JIM: I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us... 
JIM: I know. I suck. 
JIM: I know. It's very cute. 
JIM: I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort. 
JIM: I know. That's awesome, man. That's great. 
JIM: I know. We're pretty excited, too. 
JIM: I know. Yeah, it's...kinda-- 
JIM: I liked you better when you were the temp. 
JIM: I literally did not know that existed until this moment. 
JIM: I ll call you when I get there. 
JIM: I ll take five.  
JIM: I ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I d be proud to take. 
JIM: I looked at you coming around, and I said,  Wintergreen.  
JIM: I love it. 
JIM: I love Star Wars as much as the next guy  
JIM: I love their sandwiches too. 
JIM: I love you, too. 
JIM: I love you. 
JIM: I love you. 
JIM: I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go! 
JIM: I m doing this just for me? Is that what I m doing? I m doing it just for me. If that s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay? 
JIM: I m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You ve got a regional manager. 
JIM: I m gonna try a different spot. Okay? Business 
JIM: I m just gonna call you back. Thanks.  
JIM: I m not doing the Presentation. 
JIM: I m not wearing eyeliner. 
JIM: I m on the phone. I m on the phone. 
JIM: I m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck? 
JIM: I m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment. 
JIM: I m sure he s just nervous. 
JIM: I m sure you did not. What was your question? 
JIM: I m taking some time off from work well, my other work because we needed it. 
JIM: I m talking to him this afternoon, but don t get your hopes up. 
JIM: I m very sorry. 
JIM: I made a sale. 
JIM: I may have told some people that. I'm nervous. I'm about to get married. 
JIM: I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything. 
JIM: I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction. 
JIM: I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff. You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but...   Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight? 
JIM: I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right? 
JIM: I mean, do you like it? You having fun?  Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun .and you did that. 
JIM: I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly. 
JIM: I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money. 
JIM: I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that. 
JIM: I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point. 
JIM: I mean, it's just that-  You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you... 
JIM: I mean, they just need to communicate, you know? If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then-- 
JIM: I mean, you were gonna do this without me? 
JIM: I mean...  
JIM: I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win. 
JIM: I miss that. 
JIM: I miss you. 
JIM: I missed you. 
JIM: I missed you.  
JIM: I must... 
JIM: I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise.   Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year. 
JIM: I need you to breathe in my face right now. 
JIM: I need you to stay right here while you think about it. 
JIM: I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story. 
JIM: I outran it. 
JIM: I play. 
JIM: I promise you, we don t need a warning- 
JIM: I promise you, you don t have to do this for me. 
JIM: I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so... 
JIM: I really don't know how it happened, David. 
JIM: I really don't know. How you doing with all this? 
JIM: I really felt like I almost lost her, and and nothing is worth that. David 
JIM: I really think we should join forces on this one. 
JIM: I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can... 
JIM: I remember that. 
JIM: I said forget it.   
JIM: I said I was working on it. 
JIM: I saw him two minutes ago. 
JIM: I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens. 
JIM: I should leave.   
JIM: I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job. 
JIM: I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid wonderful boring amazing job. 
JIM: I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn t know. Um  actually I did tell Pam and we decided  no . But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I m thinking there s another conversation coming. And, it s hard to know when that will be. 
JIM: I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work. 
JIM: I surrender. 
JIM: I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people. 
JIM: I think I did a pretty good job. 
JIM: I think I got it right here.  
JIM: I think I know the problem. 
JIM: I think I left my wallet in your house. 
JIM: I think I m a little too busy these days to s---  Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail. 
JIM: I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat. 
JIM: I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah. 
JIM: I think I'm gonna go. 
JIM: I think I'm ready. 
JIM: I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure. 
JIM: I think it s definitely  Well, okay. Either way  
JIM: I think it'll take you a little longer than that. 
JIM: I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name. 
JIM: I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide. 
JIM: I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake. 
JIM: I think she will. 
JIM: I think she'd be a really good salesperson. 
JIM: I think she's awake. 
JIM: I think she's doing a good job. 
JIM: I think she's okay. 
JIM: I think Stanley just coughed. 
JIM: I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic. 
JIM: I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well. 
JIM: I think that's probably all we need to hear from... 
JIM: I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these.  
JIM: I think they're going to the conference finals. 
JIM: I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second.  Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention.  I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people. 
JIM: I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved. 
JIM: I think today was a good day to have two managers. 'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy. It's because they're doing it for the kids. And I get that now. 
JIM: I think we'll be okay. 
JIM: I think you could just do Andy Bernard. 
JIM: I think you did. 
JIM: I think you got this. Kay?  Alright. Feel better! 
JIM: I think you just gotta ride this one out, man. 
JIM: I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it. 
JIM: I think you mean smug 
JIM: I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan. 
JIM: I think you mean The Sting. 
JIM: I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that? 
JIM: I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one.  That s it. You look really, really good. 
JIM: I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work. 
JIM: I think you seem distracted. 
JIM: I think you should do it. That's great! 
JIM: I think you should retrace your steps. 
JIM: I think you're good. Doing a good job. 
JIM: I think you're right. 
JIM: I think you're under-thinking it. 
JIM: I thought it was a fun idea. 
JIM: I thought it was a workspace? 
JIM: I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one -- 
JIM: I thought it'd be funny. 
JIM: I thought that concert was pretty great. 
JIM: I thought that was called Nasty Christmas. 
JIM: I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this. 
JIM: I thought we had that looked at. 
JIM: I thought you had already... left. 
JIM: I thought you liked the store? Robert 
JIM: I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion. 
JIM: I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark. 
JIM: I tried. He will not listen. 
JIM: I uh, I have some ideas, actually... Business 
JIM: I understand that. 
JIM: I ve been in here for 20 seconds. 
JIM: I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill. Billy 
JIM: I wanted to talk to you about your divorce. 
JIM: I was blue group, so it was second from the top. 
JIM: I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up. 
JIM: I was gonna go with this one. 
JIM: I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known. 
JIM: I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife  David 
JIM: I was just trying to be unbiased. 
JIM: I was just... I'm in love with you. 
JIM: I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too. 
JIM: I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD. 
JIM: I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice. 
JIM: I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think? 
JIM: I was very drunk. 
JIM: I was... mocking. 
JIM: I wasn't. But thank you.   Do you know anything about this party? 
JIM: I will do some research. 
JIM: I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now. 
JIM: I will grant you one wish. 
JIM: I will. 
JIM: I will. I will. 
JIM: I win. 
JIM: I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine? 
JIM: I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car. 
JIM: I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans. 
JIM: I would like to lose 65 pounds. 
JIM: I would love to hear the other mottos. 
JIM: I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in. 
JIM: I would prefer not to. 
JIM: I wouldn t be too sure about that. Just saying. 
JIM: I wouldn't understand or a secret? 
JIM: I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it. 
JIM: I, ah... 
JIM: I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down.  I was just venting. 
JIM: I... just... if they speak Spanish. 
JIM: I... Pam, please. 
JIM: I... why don't we go back to this animation. 
JIM: I... Why would you just say something like that? 
JIM: I... will...  
JIM: I'd go with that. 
JIM: I'd say like... 10,000 to 1? 
JIM: If anyone can do this, you can do this. 
JIM: If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah. 
JIM: If everyone would like to see proof. 
JIM: If I didn t do certain things without telling Pam, she d be married to Roy.  
JIM: If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well that's pretty premature to think," but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared. 
JIM: If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry. 
JIM: If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over -- 
JIM: If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"? 
JIM: If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I this will be so huge for our family. 
JIM: If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that? 
JIM: If this doomsday device goes off... 
JIM: If this job is in a well, I don't want it. 
JIM: If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair... 
JIM: If you could help me out, that would be  
JIM: If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it. 
JIM: If you want to come back then, that'll be fine. 
JIM: If you were a real star you would put your face in it. 
JIM: I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye. 
JIM: I'll call you when I get in. 
JIM: I'll do it. 
JIM: I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and... 
JIM: I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.  
JIM: I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please! 
JIM: I'll just go later. 
JIM: I'll just leave that suit in your office then. 
JIM: I'll make it worth your while, I promise. 
JIM: I'll take it. 
JIM: I'll take it. 
JIM: I'll take over. Um, what we're doing 
JIM: I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff. 
JIM: I'll try both. 
JIM: I'm a drunk driver. 
JIM: I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch. 
JIM: I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on. 
JIM: I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing.  I've only sold one copy. 
JIM: I'm alright. 
JIM: I'm coming. 
JIM: I'm couching it! 
JIM: I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to? 
JIM: I'm driving? 
JIM: I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me. 
JIM: I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much? 
JIM: I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap! 
JIM: I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here. 
JIM: I'm going to take off actually. 
JIM: I'm going with grape. 
JIM: I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable. 
JIM: I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids. 
JIM: I'm gonna go to my desk. 
JIM: I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee. 
JIM: I'm gonna grab her, okay. 
JIM: I'm gonna help you through it all right? 
JIM: I'm gonna introduce myself. 
JIM: I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you. 
JIM: I'm gonna say fifty. 
JIM: I'm gonna write you up for not working. 
JIM: I'm good. How you doing? 
JIM: I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it. 
JIM: I'm irate right now. 
JIM: I'm Jim, by the way. 
JIM: I'm Jim.  Annnnd... let's sell some paper. 
JIM: I'm just gonna get... 
JIM: I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some? 
JIM: -I'm just gonna watch. 
JIM: I'm just gonna write "held back tears." 
JIM: I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like I'm describing a dream I had. 
JIM: I'm just kidding. She told me about it. 
JIM: I'm just killing Germans, any way I can. 
JIM: I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here. 
JIM: I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you. 
JIM: I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So my pitch is me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine. 
JIM: I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace. 
JIM: I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining. 
JIM: I'm not going to Utica right now. 
JIM: I'm not gonna-  
JIM: I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa. 
JIM: I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking. 
JIM: I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right? 
JIM: I'm not single. 
JIM: I'm not talking to you. 
JIM: I'm not talking to you. 
JIM: I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy? 
JIM: I'm not writing, "Horse Hunt." I don't even know what that means. 
JIM: I'm not. 
JIM: I'm on it. 
JIM: I'm on minute six of this message. Pam  : Okay, I do not sound like that. Man on 
JIM: I'm on the phone. 
JIM: I'm probably never gonna see you again. 
JIM: I'm really excited to meet your Mom. 
JIM: I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just... 
JIM: I'm really sorry. I can't do it. 
JIM: I'm really too tired to do this. 
JIM: I'm so sorry, I forgot. 
JIM: I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing... 
JIM: I'm so sorry. 
JIM: I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories. 
JIM: I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about? 
JIM: I'm sorry what are you whispering about? 
JIM: I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd... 
JIM: I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less? 
JIM: I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company? 
JIM: I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that? 
JIM: I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching. 
JIM: I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke. 
JIM: I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back. 
JIM: I'm sorry, Phyllis. 
JIM: I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me. 
JIM: I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really... 
JIM: I'm sorry, wait, so is the question "How'd I get to be so awesome?"  Because, I don't have an answer for you.  
JIM: I'm sorry. 
JIM: I'm sorry. This is for a news audition? 
JIM: I'm sorry? 
JIM: I'm sorry? Pam. 
JIM: I'm sure it's fine. 
JIM: I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too. 
JIM: I'm the one who complained about you. 
JIM: I'm trying--- 
JIM: I'm trying everything. 
JIM: I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa. 
JIM: I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy. Nail stylist 
JIM: I'm... leaving on June 8th. 
JIM: Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that s an amazing gift. 
JIM: Improv sounds great. 
JIM: In Philadelphia. 
JIM: In Philly, so, that doesn t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea. 
JIM: In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment. 
JIM: In the bed. 
JIM: In the box.  
JIM: In the fridge. 
JIM: In the women's bathroom, above the sink. 
JIM: In this car? 
JIM: In well? 
JIM: Inappropriate. 
JIM: Interesting, what's that like? 
JIM: Into a lake. 
JIM: Is- 
JIM: Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet? 
JIM: Is he OK? 
JIM: Is he you? 
JIM: Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here? 
JIM: Is it me, or are we just a little off today? 
JIM: Is it? 
JIM: Is that another motto? 
JIM: Is that him? 
JIM: Is that it? 
JIM: Is that Michael? 
JIM: Is that Mose? 
JIM: Is that off again? 
JIM: Is that really how you want to get this job? 
JIM: Is that really what you think? 
JIM: Is that the buzzer from Taboo? 
JIM: Is that trash talk from Pam? 
JIM: Is that what happened to you? 
JIM: Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it. 
JIM: Is that you singing? 
JIM: Is that your office? 
JIM: Is there a limit? 
JIM: Is there anything -- 
JIM: Is there really? 
JIM: Is there some evidence? 
JIM: Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things? 
JIM: Is this a bad time to be doing this? 
JIM: Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank. 
JIM: Is this allowed? 
JIM: Is this real?  
JIM: Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you... 
JIM: Isn't that thing huge? 
JIM: It didn t have a buster sign around him? Why don t you draw him? Why don t we see this whole thing. 
JIM: It doesn't matter. 
JIM: It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago. 
JIM: It has been, yeah. 
JIM: It is going really great. 
JIM: It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather. 
JIM: It is really special. 
JIM: It is right. I mean, it's impossible. 
JIM: It is totally insane. 
JIM: It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again. 
JIM: It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you! 
JIM: It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it. 
JIM: It is. Big time. 
JIM: It is... more of a spicy brown, actually. 
JIM: It just feels a little bit, like... 
JIM: It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'. 
JIM: It s a little, uh, personal. 
JIM: It s a monkey. 
JIM: It s from the teapot. Everything you ll ever need to know is in that note.  Not enough for me? You are everything. 
JIM: It s great. 
JIM: It s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I m stuck here trying to keep him on board. 
JIM: It s just a list of our names, split into two columns. 
JIM: It s Okay. 
JIM: It s pretty great, right? I mean, we re coming along   Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis s timeline 
JIM: It s Ryan.  I m sorry. I lied. I m not in the bathroom. I can t do it. I need to see my mom. I m going home.  
JIM: It s, it s nothing. 
JIM: It says "workspace". 
JIM: It stopped. 
JIM: It was- 
JIM: It was -- 
JIM: It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven. 
JIM: It was an away game. 
JIM: It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things. 
JIM: It was pretty uneventful, actually. 
JIM: It was there when I sat down. 
JIM: It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later. 
JIM: It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ... 
JIM: It was. 
JIM: It wasn't me. 
JIM: It wasn't me. 
JIM: It will be Angela. 
JIM: It won t budge. 
JIM: It would look bad. Sorry. 
JIM: It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy.  Is bold the right word? 
JIM: It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls? 
JIM: It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just- 
JIM: It's a killer new dance move.  Do you wanna talk in your office? 
JIM: It's a pen. 
JIM: It's a pretty good idea, don't you think? 
JIM: It's a real handsome duck. 
JIM: It's all gold. 
JIM: It's all good. Are we all good? 
JIM: It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird. 
JIM: It's broken right, he can't... 
JIM: It's 'cause I'm more of a player. 
JIM: It's fascinating. 
JIM: It's fine. 
JIM: It's fire. 
JIM: It's getting late. 
JIM: It's going to be alright. 
JIM: It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out. We're not going under. 
JIM: It's hard to tell so far. 
JIM: It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy. 
JIM: It's Kurt. Wow, I am so sad that I know that. 
JIM: It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday. 
JIM: It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating. 
JIM: It's Mose. Who do you think it is? 
JIM: It's my own fault- 
JIM: It's my pleasure.  Hello? Well that's great.  Turns out the paper was there all along. 
JIM: It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great. 
JIM: It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real. 
JIM: It's not hilarious, but... 
JIM: It's not--- It's not about me. I mean, this your dream. 
JIM: It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about? 
JIM: It's not my favorite... 
JIM: It's not on your desk. 
JIM: It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or... 
JIM: It's not. It's different. But it's a good book. 
JIM: It's okay. 
JIM: It's pretty good actually. 
JIM: It's really good to see you, man. 
JIM: It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick. 
JIM: It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this. 
JIM: It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here. 
JIM: Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners. 
JIM: It's still happening right now actually, so uh... 
JIM: It's still on a bike path though right? 
JIM: It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks. 
JIM: It's the lever on the side. 
JIM: It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds. 
JIM: It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  He is very real. 
JIM: It's, okay, it's Jim. Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened. 
JIM: I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses-- 
JIM: I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart--  How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it. 
JIM: I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it. OK, good luck! 
JIM: I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly. 
JIM: I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number  ...no. 
JIM: I've spent so much of my life telling myself "Please, don't end up like Stanley," and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes. 
JIM: Jackpot. 
JIM: Jan didn't come back for her car last night. 
JIM: Jerry. 
JIM: Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it...   
JIM: Jim Halpert. 
JIM: Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker. 
JIM: Jimbo! 
JIM: John Dillinger. 
JIM: Jonas Salk. 
JIM: Just  and then you'll be saved. 
JIM: Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though. 
JIM: Just about... yup. Now. 
JIM: Just all the - drama. 
JIM: Just check it. 
JIM: Just do it. 
JIM: Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown. 
JIM: Just have Dwight punch you. 
JIM: Just keep him awake. 
JIM: Just like that. 
JIM: Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please? 
JIM: Just steer more now. 
JIM: Just take the parrot. 
JIM: Just tell her the real reason. 
JIM: Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here. 
JIM: Just... quit stalling. 
JIM: Just...you good? 
JIM: Justin Timberlake? 
JIM: Just--Just--Hey!  
JIM: K, Kevin, are you saying  See the world ? or  Sea World?  
JIM: Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights. 
JIM: Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless. 
JIM: Kathy wants to leave our clump? 
JIM: Katie Holmes. 
JIM: Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn. 
JIM: Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard. 
JIM: Kelly! 
JIM: Kelly, you know what... 
JIM: Kev! 
JIM: Kev, c'mon. 
JIM: Kev, have a good weekend. 
JIM: Kevin Costner. 
JIM: Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you   and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot?   Does that end the debate? 
JIM: Kev's out. 
JIM: Keys, keys... 
JIM: KGB. 
JIM: Kickoff.   My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork.   Alright!   
JIM: Killer nanorobots? 
JIM: Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I?  Guten Prank  number one. 
JIM: Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry. 
JIM: Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it? 
JIM: Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously. 
JIM: Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham!  Gotta go through me first. 
JIM: Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest. 
JIM: Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of...  eleven dollars. 
JIM: Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix   me asking the boss of the company I m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So  problem solved. Thanks, guys. 
JIM: Later, Kev.  Have a good weekend. 
JIM: Lay it on me. 
JIM: Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin? 
JIM: Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game. 
JIM: Leave the telescope. 
JIM: Leave. 
JIM: Left. 
JIM: Left. 
JIM: Let me call you right back. Okay. 
JIM: Let me guess, you think you should get it. 
JIM: Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like... 
JIM: Let me show you what I mean.  Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done. 
JIM: Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked. 
JIM: Let s do it! 
JIM: Let s hear it. 
JIM: Let s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you re expecting a fax today, please don t yell out,  Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.  Ok? That s nonsense. 
JIM: Let the games begin.  
JIM: Let's do it, shoot it. 
JIM: Let's do it. 
JIM: Let's do it. 
JIM: Let's give it a shot. 
JIM: Let's go driver!  Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so... 
JIM: Let's go to the conference room. 
JIM: Let's Go! 
JIM: Let's go. 
JIM: Let's go. 
JIM: Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk. 
JIM: Lets just go. 
JIM: Let's see it. Show of hands. 
JIM: Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago? 
JIM: Let's start with... your mom. 
JIM: Let's take a look. Nice. 
JIM: Let's... eh... see ya. 
JIM: Like a boyfriend? 
JIM: Like hypothetically  if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have. 
JIM: Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, "Mom, there's a ghost in my closet." Now, you say one of two things - one, "You're just having a bad dream," or two, "Let's go see what it was." 
JIM: Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager. 
JIM: Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but... 
JIM: Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store. 
JIM: Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who s the strongest? Well, there s only one way to solve that   flat curl contest. 
JIM: Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball. 
JIM: Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over. 
JIM: Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck. 
JIM: Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win. 
JIM: Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine. So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along. 
JIM: Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here. 
JIM: Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this. 
JIM: Loggins and Messina. 
JIM: Look at that form. 
JIM: Look at that one though, he's smiling! 
JIM: Look at that. Bob ordered hot food. 
JIM: Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good? 
JIM: Look who s back. 
JIM: Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted. 
JIM: Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she? 
JIM: Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved? 
JIM: Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you? 
JIM: Look, Pam, I don t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It s gone. That moment s just gone. I missed it. 
JIM: Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it. Okay? This was your idea anyway. 
JIM: Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so- 
JIM: Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults. 
JIM: Look, you have a lot of strengths. 
JIM: Looks like a red wire. 
JIM: Lord, beer me strength. 
JIM: Louder, son! 
JIM: Lousy Picture. 
JIM: Love it. Keep it goin. 
JIM: Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. 
JIM: Love that one. 
JIM: LOVE the hair.   
JIM: Love you too.   
JIM: Love you too. Bye. 
JIM: Love you.  
JIM: Love. 
JIM: Lucky us. 
JIM: M. Night Shulman? 
JIM: Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl. 
JIM: Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago. 
JIM: Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out? 
JIM: Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli. 
JIM: Man. 
JIM: Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember. 
JIM: Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away. 
JIM: Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow. Bar 
JIM: Maybe put up some shelves. 
JIM: Maybe Stanford would be cool. 
JIM: Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or -- 
JIM: Maybe we should just wait and find out. 
JIM: Maybe we will someday. 
JIM: Maybe you should. 
JIM: Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and... 
JIM: Maybe. Thanks. 
JIM: Me neither. Whew. 
JIM: Me, too. 
JIM: Me, too. 
JIM: Members of the office, hear ye. 
JIM: Meredith Van Helsing? 
JIM: Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for. 
JIM: Merry Christmas Dwight. 
JIM: Michael -  Great. 
JIM: Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it.  
JIM: Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes. 
JIM: Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate. 
JIM: Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands. 
JIM: Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings. Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania. Ben 
JIM: Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the- 
JIM: Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck. 
JIM: Michael stop. 
JIM: Michael stop.  
JIM: Michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet. 
JIM: Michael! Michael, pull over! 
JIM: Michael, can I talk to you in your office? 
JIM: Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why. 
JIM: Michael, come on! 
JIM: Michael, did you say anything? 
JIM: Michael, don't. 
JIM: Michael, Dwight would like your man meat. 
JIM: Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today. 
JIM: Michael, I really didn't mean to... 
JIM: Michael, I think you really want to talk to him. 
JIM: Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us. 
JIM: Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think. 
JIM: Michael, I told you. 
JIM: Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool. 
JIM: Michael, I'm just trying to -- 
JIM: Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam. 
JIM: Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you... 
JIM: Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa. 
JIM: Michael, it's really not a competition. 
JIM: Michael, just go park the car. 
JIM: Michael, look I'll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed. 
JIM: Michael, no... 
JIM: Michael, not now. 
JIM: Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York. 
JIM: Michael, that is hilarious. 
JIM: Michael, this is a conference room meeting. 
JIM: Michael, wait. So they said we are sold? 
JIM: Michael, watch the road! 
JIM: Michael, we only told our parents last week. 
JIM: Michael, you didn't even know her. 
JIM: Michael, you don't have to do this. 
JIM: Michael, you shouldn't have done that. 
JIM: Michael. 
JIM: Michael. 
JIM: Michael. 
JIM: Michael. 
JIM: Michael. 
JIM: Michael. 
JIM: Michael. Am I the first to arrive? 
JIM: Michael. Michael. 
JIM: Michael... 
JIM: Michael... 
JIM: Michael... 
JIM: Michael? 
JIM: Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly. 
JIM: Michael's stupid scavenger hunt. 
JIM: Microgement. 
JIM: Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy. 
JIM: Mind control. 
JIM: Mind if I join? 
JIM: Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so- 
JIM: Missed the last part. 
JIM: Mm! 
JIM: Mm, hey driver. Why don t you take us to 3030 Adams? 
JIM: Mm. No. Wrong on both counts. 
JIM: Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so... 
JIM: Mm... not really, no. 
JIM: Mm-hm Athlead 
JIM: Mmhm. 
JIM: Mm-hm. 
JIM: Mm-hm. 
JIM: Mmhmm, yeah. 
JIM: Mmhmm. 
JIM: Mmhmm. 
JIM: Mmhmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was? 
JIM: Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry. 
JIM: Mm-hmm? 
JIM: Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev. 
JIM: Mmm hmm. 
JIM: Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please. 
JIM: Mmm. 
JIM: Mmm. 
JIM: Mmm. 
JIM: Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead? 
JIM: Mmm... 
JIM: Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else. 
JIM: Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal. 
JIM: Mmm-hmm. 
JIM: Mmm-hmm. 
JIM: Mmm-hmm. 
JIM: Mmm-hmm. 
JIM: Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority. 
JIM: MmmHmm... 
JIM: Mmmkay... 
JIM: Mmum, still wrong. 
JIM: Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott. Mr. 
JIM: Morning! 
JIM: Morning, Dwight 
JIM: Mose has been weird? That s so unlike him. 
JIM: Mosquito. 
JIM: Most apartments these days have like three. 
JIM: Mr. Beesly. How are ya? Mr. 
JIM: Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks.  Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying...  Hello? Thanks, Dwight. 
JIM: Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years. Phil 
JIM: My bad. 
JIM: My condolences. 
JIM: My god, I m so sorry. Well this might make up for 
JIM: My home office, this is it. 
JIM: My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this. 
JIM: Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright. 
JIM: Nah, you definitely weren t kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in.  
JIM: Nah. Might as well do it now. 
JIM: Nellie 
JIM: Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door. 
JIM: Nevermind. 
JIM: New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door  
JIM: New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York? 
JIM: Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car. 
JIM: Next 
JIM: Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun. Front Desk 
JIM: Nice job everybody. Great work. 
JIM: Nice job, Beesly. 
JIM: Nice job, I think you got 'em. 
JIM: Nice job, man. 
JIM: Nice job. 
JIM: Nice job. 
JIM: Nice to meet you, yeah. Whew! I can assure you we don't need a new system though. Happy with ours. 
JIM: Nice try, this is ridiculous. 
JIM: Nice! 
JIM: Nice. 
JIM: Nice. 
JIM: Nice. 
JIM: Nice. 
JIM: Nice. 
JIM: Nice. 
JIM: Nice.  
JIM: Nice.   
JIM: Nice.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh! 
JIM: Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don t listen to it at all because we re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so  
JIM: Nice. Smart. 
JIM: Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich. 
JIM: Nice. Third book? 
JIM: Nice. Well, what's it all about? 
JIM: Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so... 
JIM: Night-night. 
JIM: No big deal. 
JIM: No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar? 
JIM: No he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him. 
JIM: No I didn't. 
JIM: No I'm not drunk. Are you drunk? 
JIM: No I'm not. 
JIM: No it's not. 
JIM: No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right. 
JIM: No more than a week. Maybe two weeks. 
JIM: No need. I saw him do it. I can try it. 
JIM: No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra. 
JIM: No one should be planking at all. 
JIM: No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done. 
JIM: No one. 
JIM: No one's moving! 
JIM: No politics? 
JIM: No problem. 
JIM: No problem. 
JIM: No shame in that. Get it all out in the open. 
JIM: No she doesn't wa- She's not here. 
JIM: No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything. 
JIM: No thanks. 
JIM: No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations! 
JIM: No way, a 280? 
JIM: No way. 
JIM: No way. 
JIM: No way. 
JIM: No way. 
JIM: No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later? 
JIM: No way. I think she likes this stuff. 
JIM: No way. Let's do this  Oh. 
JIM: No you don't. 
JIM: No you don't. 
JIM: No! My wife does not believe in ghosts. 
JIM: No! No! 
JIM: No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke? 
JIM: No, actually. 
JIM: No, because of the promotion. 
JIM: No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place. 
JIM: No, can't. 
JIM: No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do. 
JIM: No, don't be. 
JIM: No, don't push. Pull. Pull. 
JIM: No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'. 
JIM: No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa. 
JIM: No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money. But- 
JIM: No, Dwight. You ll be doing the whacking. 
JIM: No, fake girlfriends are always wrong. 
JIM: No, he didn't.  
JIM: No, I did that before, it added nothing. 
JIM: No, I didn t notice anything. 
JIM: No, I didn't. 
JIM: No, I didn't.   You know why? 
JIM: No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so... 
JIM: No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair. 
JIM: No, I don't think I can... 
JIM: No, I don't think so. 
JIM: No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing. 
JIM: No, I don't. 
JIM: No, I don't. 
JIM: No, I hear what you re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright? 
JIM: No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What s up? 
JIM: No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice. 
JIM: No, I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right? 
JIM: No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection. 
JIM: No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons. 
JIM: No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it. 
JIM: No, I told you I don t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early. 
JIM: No, I told you to warn me at five minutes. 
JIM: No, I won't. Alright, thanks for giving me your time, I appreciate it. 
JIM: No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please. 
JIM: No, I... 
JIM: No, I.... 
JIM: No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop. 
JIM: No, I'm not calling Karen. 
JIM: No, I'm not doing that! 
JIM: No, I'm not doing that. 
JIM: No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody. 
JIM: No, I'm not gonna call you that. 
JIM: No, I'm not gonna do that. 
JIM: No, I'm not making bread. 
JIM: No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time. 
JIM: No, I'm serious. There's always something better. 
JIM: No, I'm sure you're right. 
JIM: No, it-  
JIM: No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does. 
JIM: No, it was before I knew you so, its fine. 
JIM: No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream. 
JIM: No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael! 
JIM: No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, "world's longest engagement", um, we're all expecting it, you know? 
JIM: No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um... 
JIM: No, it's not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie. 
JIM: No, it's not, because you don't really work here. 
JIM: No, it's not. 
JIM: No, it's not. I did. Yep. 
JIM: No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk. 
JIM: No, it's, it's okay. Okay. 
JIM: No, just kidding. Seriously though, that's enough. 
JIM: No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?! 
JIM: No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each. 
JIM: No, like baseball. A baseball team. 
JIM: No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car. 
JIM: No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel 
JIM: No, no absolutely we are not doing this. 
JIM: No, no, don't do anything to them. 
JIM: No, no, dude, no. 
JIM: No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam. 
JIM: No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'. 
JIM: No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back. 
JIM: No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this! 
JIM: No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead. 
JIM: No, no, no, no, no. No. 
JIM: No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we re just starting couple s counseling. Uh, which doesn t sound any better. 
JIM: No, no, no, no. 
JIM: No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this. 
JIM: No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular. 
JIM: No, no, no, no... 
JIM: No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back. 
JIM: No, no, no, Stanley. 
JIM: No, no, no. 
JIM: No, no, no. 
JIM: No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen. 
JIM: No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk... 
JIM: No, No, we'll just board that up. It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about. 
JIM: No, no, you saw through me, great. 
JIM: No, no, you won't do that. Nope. 
JIM: No, no. 
JIM: No, no. I want to hear you tell it. 
JIM: No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal. 
JIM: No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or... 
JIM: No, not at all. 
JIM: No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat. 
JIM: No, not exactly. 
JIM: No, not more than anything. 
JIM: No, not without a "please." 
JIM: No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour. 
JIM: No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding. 
JIM: No, Pam. 
JIM: No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith s face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim. 
JIM: No, really, what s going on? 
JIM: No, see? Right there, that s the problem with your method.  Cause I still don t know if you re saying  Sea World  or  see the world,  and it s taking a lot of time to explain it. 
JIM: No, she's not. 
JIM: No, sometimes its right. 
JIM: No, stop it. 
JIM: No, thanks. 
JIM: No, thanks. I'm good. 
JIM: No, thanks. You having fun? 
JIM: No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this. 
JIM: No, that is what I mean. 
JIM: No, that was unbelievable. 
JIM: No, that wasn't fun. 
JIM: No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here. 
JIM: No, that's Andy's office. 
JIM: No, that's him. 
JIM: No, that's not what I- 
JIM: No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work.  We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay?  What the hell happened out there?  
JIM: No, they don't. 
JIM: No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah? 
JIM: No, uh- 
JIM: No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme? 
JIM: No, was it good? 
JIM: No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay  Hey everybody! 
JIM: No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it. 
JIM: No, we definitely can talk about it in the next-- Andy and 
JIM: No, we don't. 
JIM: No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap. 
JIM: No, we used to. Now we're friends. 
JIM: No, we're good. Thank you, though. 
JIM: No, we've been dating for six months. 
JIM: No, why would you think that? 
JIM: No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me. 
JIM: No, you can't fire me. 
JIM: No, you chose yourself. 
JIM: No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone. 
JIM: No, you're definitely the problem. 
JIM: No, you're making this up! 
JIM: No, you're not reopening the case. The case is closed. 
JIM: No, you're not. I'm looking right at you. 
JIM: No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it. 
JIM: No. 
JIM: No. 
JIM: No. 
JIM: No. 
JIM: No.

JIM: No.   Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier. 
JIM: No. Bob, no. No! 
JIM: No. He was maybe thinking of you for it. 
JIM: No. I can't. It was like, hours ago. 
JIM: No. I just missed my wife. 
JIM: No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you. 
JIM: No. I would've said no. 
JIM: No. It's cool. 
JIM: No. Let's talk for a long time. 
JIM: No. Looks good. 
JIM: No. Michael. Michael. 
JIM: No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...? 
JIM: No. No, I'm not gonna-no. 
JIM: No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think. 
JIM: No. No. 
JIM: No. No. Definitely. It's .. 
JIM: No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame. 
JIM: No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should. 
JIM: No. Okay. Um, I ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone? 
JIM: No. She wasn't. 
JIM: No. Thank you, though. 
JIM: No. Thank you. 
JIM: No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not... 
JIM: No. There's no extra outfit in the bag. 
JIM: No. They're in the conference room. 
JIM: No. This is a fire cracker free wedding. 
JIM: No. We took a walk. 
JIM: No. We're not. 
JIM: No. What party? 
JIM: No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go. 
JIM: No... 
JIM: No... I think it's a great idea. 
JIM: No... sport. 
JIM: No? Nothin'? 
JIM: Nobody asked, Bob! 
JIM: Nobody tell him! 
JIM: Nobody! Business 
JIM: Nobody. 
JIM: Nobody's for. 
JIM: None of this is time sensitive. 
JIM: No-no-no-no-no. 
JIM: Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working. 
JIM: Nope we're not brothers. 
JIM: Nope, go back to the script. 
JIM: Nope, it's because it's genitalia. 
JIM: Nope, just going to see Pam. 
JIM: Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now. 
JIM: Nope, not a prank. I think it s time for you to bury the hatchet. 
JIM: Nope, not at all. 
JIM: Nope, not doing that. 
JIM: Nope, that's okay. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. 
JIM: Nope. Baskets have it. 
JIM: Nope. Can t accept that job. It s not a real job. 
JIM: Nope. Different movie. 
JIM: Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now. 
JIM: Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or- 
JIM: Nope. I think that was it.  
JIM: Nope. I'm numbering the paper. 
JIM: Nope. It's over. 
JIM: Nope. Just...  Okay.  
JIM: Nope. No dog video. 
JIM: Nope. No. 
JIM: Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am. 
JIM: Nope. Not guilty. 
JIM: Nope. OK. 
JIM: Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.  
JIM: Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands? 
JIM: Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor? 
JIM: Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm... 
JIM: Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now.  
JIM: Nos? You mean like in fast and furious? 
JIM: Not a surprise. 
JIM: Not as good as you. 
JIM: Not at all, can we go? 
JIM: Not at all. It should be Dwight. David 
JIM: Not bad right.  
JIM: Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian. 
JIM: Not cool.   
JIM: Not enough? I don t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it s against the rules but I m gonna need a favor from you guys. Camera 
JIM: Not even a thought! It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright! 
JIM: Not even an exclamation point? 
JIM: Not even Harry Potter? 
JIM: Not gonna change. 
JIM: Not gravel, obviously.  No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So- 
JIM: Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half. 
JIM: Not his mom's car. 
JIM: Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony. 
JIM: Not it. 
JIM: Not much what's up with you? 
JIM: Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so--- 
JIM: Not much. 
JIM: Not my favorite, but... 
JIM: Not Night at the Roxbury. 
JIM: Not now, Toby, my God! 
JIM: Not really a question.  Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.  
JIM: Not really a rhyme. 
JIM: Not really. I've seen a bathroom before. 
JIM: Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman. 
JIM: Not that, don't... 
JIM: Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy. 
JIM: Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place. 
JIM: Not your birthday. 
JIM: Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship. 
JIM: Nothin' much what's up with you? 
JIM: Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually little awkward. 
JIM: Nothing yet. 
JIM: Nothing, just talking. 
JIM: Nothing. 
JIM: Nothing. 
JIM: Nothing. 
JIM: Nothing. 
JIM: Nothing. 
JIM: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you? 
JIM: Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er? 
JIM: Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo. 
JIM: Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good! 
JIM: Notify the athletes. 
JIM: Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or- 
JIM: Now he is saying "Hi" louder. 
JIM: Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious. 
JIM: Now how do you know how it works? 
JIM: Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it. 
JIM: Now that sounds serious. 
JIM: Now you're just being hurtful. 
JIM: Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation? 
JIM: Now, this is the projection over three months? 
JIM: Now, were those for the team? 
JIM: Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers? 
JIM: Now, you listen to me, sir. 
JIM: Nurse! 
JIM: O...K. 
JIM: O..ok. Um..good. 
JIM: Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager. 
JIM: Obviously. 
JIM: Of course I did. 
JIM: Of course I read it. 
JIM: Of course. 
JIM: Of course. 
JIM: Of course. What is like a hostage? 
JIM: Oh- 
JIM: Oh  okay. Where would we go? 
JIM: Oh actually I withdrew from consideration. 
JIM: Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen. 
JIM: Oh boy. 
JIM: Oh boy. 
JIM: Oh boy. 
JIM: Oh boy... 
JIM: Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything? 
JIM: Oh by the way how's your side project going? 
JIM: Oh do you mean when I get the job? 
JIM: Oh Dwight, Dwight,  Ohhhhhh! Jim and 
JIM: Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours? 
JIM: Oh good, so we don't have to work. 
JIM: Oh great, can't wait.  
JIM: Oh great, I have to cover? 
JIM: Oh hey, Dwight. 
JIM: Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty. 
JIM: Oh I'm sorry. What? 
JIM: Oh initially I did. 
JIM: Oh it has losers. 
JIM: Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us. 
JIM: Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons. 
JIM: Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too. 
JIM: Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim.  I got nothin'.  
JIM: Oh man, it was great. They were great. 
JIM: Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars. 
JIM: Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too. 
JIM: Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary? Limo 
JIM: Oh man.  
JIM: Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright? 
JIM: Oh my God! 
JIM: Oh my God! 
JIM: Oh my God! 
JIM: Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years. 
JIM: Oh my God! You are so drunk! 
JIM: Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please? 
JIM: Oh my God, David. That's horrible. 
JIM: Oh my God, Dwight, put that down. 
JIM: Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing? 
JIM: Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool. 
JIM: Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more. 
JIM: Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies. 
JIM: Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back! 
JIM: Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go. 
JIM: Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton. 
JIM: Oh my God, there is a castle. 
JIM: Oh my God. 
JIM: Oh my God. 
JIM: Oh my God. 
JIM: Oh my God. 
JIM: Oh my God. 
JIM: Oh my God.  Oh my God. 
JIM: Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker! 
JIM: Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes. 
JIM: Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again.   
JIM: Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it. 
JIM: Oh my god. That's less romantic. 
JIM: Oh my god. That's so romantic. 
JIM: Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we?  
JIM: Oh my God... 
JIM: Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy. 
JIM: Oh no she just put it in front of my face. 
JIM: Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car. 
JIM: Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you... 
JIM: Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache? 
JIM: Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?! 
JIM: Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something? 
JIM: Oh no, no, no. That's ok.  Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center? Limo 
JIM: Oh no, that would be great. 
JIM: Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing. 
JIM: Oh no, we're just sitting here. 
JIM: Oh no. 
JIM: Oh no. I was just - 
JIM: Oh no? 
JIM: Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody! 
JIM: Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud. 
JIM: Oh thanks, Phyllis. 
JIM: Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain. 
JIM: Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken. 
JIM: Oh totally. Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still? 
JIM: Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff... 
JIM: Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he? 
JIM: Oh wow, thank you. 
JIM: Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too? What did she accomplish? 
JIM: Oh wow, these are nice. 
JIM: Oh wow. So that s two miles if you incorporate the walk back. 
JIM: Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her. 
JIM: Oh yeah- 
JIM: Oh yeah, definitely. 
JIM: Oh yeah, did he text us? 
JIM: Oh yeah, I understood. 
JIM: Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay. 
JIM: Oh yeah. 
JIM: Oh yeah. 
JIM: Oh yeah. 
JIM: Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting? 
JIM: Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase. 
JIM: Oh yeah. Why? 
JIM: Oh yeah? 
JIM: Oh yeah? 
JIM: Oh yeah? 
JIM: Oh yeah? 
JIM: Oh yeah? What's the first best? 
JIM: Oh yes. Ever since the storm. 
JIM: Oh you did? 
JIM: Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure. 
JIM: Oh! 
JIM: Oh! 
JIM: Oh! 
JIM: Oh! 
JIM: Oh! 
JIM: OH!   
JIM: Oh! Goal! 
JIM: Oh! Hire a magician. 
JIM: Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight? 
JIM: Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam. 
JIM: Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on.  Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite.  Desert Island. Five movies. Go. 
JIM: Oh! See I'm here to learn as little information as possible. All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout. 
JIM: Oh! That was really.  This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all. 
JIM: Oh! There it is! 
JIM: Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled. 
JIM: Oh,  she's asleep. 
JIM: Oh,  Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh... Business 
JIM: Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he ll be calling in any second. 
JIM: Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out. 
JIM: Oh, also, while you re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that. 
JIM: Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally. 
JIM: Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine. 
JIM: Oh, and I get to carry it. 
JIM: Oh, Andy. You know what? We don't have a lot of time, so we should probably... 
JIM: Oh, are you firing Creed? 
JIM: Oh, Aunt Phyllis. 
JIM: Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too.  
JIM: Oh, but you didn't. 
JIM: Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood. 
JIM: Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned. 
JIM: Oh, Clark. I m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back. 
JIM: Oh, come on! 
JIM: Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right? 
JIM: Oh, come on, Pam. I- 
JIM: Oh, come on, Pete! God, that s just sad. If he doesn t watch himself, he s gonna be here for years, doing nothing.  Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim. 
JIM: Oh, come on, that sounds awesome. 
JIM: Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding. 
JIM: Oh, cool.  
JIM: Oh, crap. Were those yours? 
JIM: Oh, Dawson's Creek. 
JIM: Oh, did the press ask for a story? 
JIM: Oh, don t look at me cause I think you re making a terrible choice. 
JIM: Oh, don't be that person. 
JIM: Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong. 
JIM: Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind. 
JIM: Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much. 
JIM: Oh, excuse me. It's my... favorite part. 
JIM: Oh, god, nature, please. 
JIM: Oh, God. 
JIM: Oh, God.  
JIM: Oh, good, phew, thank god you said that. 
JIM: Oh, good. 
JIM: Oh, great. 
JIM: Oh, great. 
JIM: Oh, great. 
JIM: Oh, great.  "Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy." Oh that's not good. 
JIM: Oh, great. So we ll see somebody else s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it s really not that hard to film a video. 
JIM: Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall." 
JIM: Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight... 
JIM: Oh, hello Mater. Good 
JIM: Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there. 
JIM: Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression. 
JIM: Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes! 
JIM: Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim. Walter 
JIM: Oh, hey, man.  Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview. 
JIM: Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs. 
JIM: Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim. 
JIM: Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth. 
JIM: Oh, hi. 
JIM: Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought. 
JIM: Oh, Holy Mother of God. 
JIM: Oh, I- 
JIM: Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor. Businessman 
JIM: Oh, I can do that. 
JIM: Oh, I can't beat Darryl. 
JIM: Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky. 
JIM: Oh, I didn t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo. 
JIM: Oh, I didn't know you knew her? 
JIM: Oh, I don't know. 
JIM: Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so-- 
JIM: Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though. 
JIM: Oh, I don't think that is what's happening. 
JIM: Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.? 
JIM: Oh, I expected more from young Halpert. 
JIM: Oh, I like you. 
JIM: Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later. 
JIM: Oh, I stand corrected. 
JIM: Oh, I thought it was your mom. 
JIM: Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight. 
JIM: Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So... 
JIM: Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean? 
JIM: Oh, I wouldn't-  
JIM: Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer. 
JIM: Oh, I'll walk you out. 
JIM: Oh, I'm engaged to Pam. 
JIM: Oh, I'm so glad you didn't. 
JIM: Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about... 
JIM: Oh, I'm sorry. 
JIM: Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now? 
JIM: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
JIM: Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes? 
JIM: Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good. 
JIM: Oh, is she that teacher in the white? 
JIM: Oh, it s happening! Let s just keep it between you and me for right now. 
JIM: Oh, it s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled. 
JIM: Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores. 
JIM: Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone... 
JIM: Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know. 
JIM: Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever. 
JIM: Oh, it's like naughty or nice. 
JIM: Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave? By the quarry? 
JIM: Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos. 
JIM: Oh, man, I d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions. 
JIM: Oh, man, so many points being made. 
JIM: Oh, man. Yeah, I can t do it. 
JIM: Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want. 
JIM: Oh, man. You remember that, huh? 
JIM: Oh, my God 
JIM: Oh, my god! 
JIM: Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World. 
JIM: Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God. 
JIM: Oh, my God, thank you.  Thank you. 
JIM: Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer. 
JIM: Oh, my God. 
JIM: Oh, my God. Are you serious? 
JIM: Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day. 
JIM: Oh, my God. Please. 
JIM: Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just... 
JIM: Oh, nice. Did you check that list? 
JIM: Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right? 
JIM: Oh, no no. 
JIM: Oh, no, absolutely. 
JIM: Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to... 
JIM: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party. 
JIM: Oh, no, no. No. 
JIM: Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there. 
JIM: Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes. 
JIM: Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in  March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so   
JIM: Oh, no. 
JIM: Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but... 
JIM: Oh, nothing. 
JIM: Oh, nothing. 
JIM: Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something. 
JIM: Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday. 
JIM: Oh, oh yeah. 
JIM: Oh, ok, cool. 
JIM: Oh, OK. 
JIM: Oh, OK. 
JIM: Oh, OK. 
JIM: Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me. 
JIM: Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that. 
JIM: Oh, okay. 
JIM: Oh, okay.   Don't worry about it. 
JIM: Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass. 
JIM: Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier. 
JIM: Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well we all came, so... 
JIM: Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking? 
JIM: Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance. 
JIM: Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend. 
JIM: Oh, she's good actually. 
JIM: Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam. 
JIM: Oh, so that's it? 
JIM: Oh, sorry gotta go. 
JIM: Oh, sorry, wait one second. 
JIM: Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here. 
JIM: Oh, sure. 
JIM: Oh, tell him I say hi. 
JIM: Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare. 
JIM: Oh, thank you! 
JIM: Oh, thank you. I've been working out. 
JIM: Oh, thanks man. 
JIM: Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that. 
JIM: Oh, thanks. 
JIM: Oh, that reminds me.  Little something from all of us.  
JIM: Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me. 
JIM: Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close? 
JIM: OH, that's great. I'm really happy for  
JIM: Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty. 
JIM: Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is 
JIM: Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out.   
JIM: Oh, there he goes. 
JIM: Oh, there it is. J1. 
JIM: Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen. 
JIM: Oh, they're my client. 
JIM: Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man? 
JIM: Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with. 
JIM: Oh, this looks promising. 
JIM: Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about? 
JIM: Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like. 
JIM: Oh, uh, is it too late to get in? Businessman 
JIM: Oh, uh, later-ish. 
JIM: Oh, uh, no. Could- 
JIM: Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing. 
JIM: Oh, um.  Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it. 
JIM: Oh, um...  
JIM: Oh, um... .I can't. 
JIM: Oh, um... Are you really mad about this? 
JIM: Oh, um... Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  
JIM: Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain. 
JIM: Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday? 
JIM: Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell. 
JIM: Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby. 
JIM: Oh, well, that's coming.  
JIM: Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do  opportunities.  
JIM: Oh, would you look at that. 
JIM: Oh, wow. But, um Oh, I get that. 
JIM: Oh, wow. So cute. 
JIM: Oh, wow. That's cool. 
JIM: Oh, yeah 
JIM: Oh, yeah, definitely have nos. 
JIM: Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?  
JIM: Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too. 
JIM: Oh, yeah, so we ll just do that later. 
JIM: Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it. We'll figure it out. We'll be okay. 
JIM: Oh, yeah. 
JIM: Oh, yeah. 
JIM: Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it. 
JIM: Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.   Oh, that's my new "Dwight" ring. 
JIM: Oh, yeah. Pregnant. 
JIM: Oh, yeah. She's hot. 
JIM: Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter. 
JIM: Oh, yikes. 
JIM: Oh, you don't know her. 
JIM: Oh, you don't want to know. 
JIM: Oh, you guys doing a little construction? 
JIM: Oh, you know what? I gotta go. 
JIM: Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush. 
JIM: Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets. 
JIM: Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I m gone. 
JIM: Oh, you want me to be you? 
JIM: Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh. 
JIM: Oh.  
JIM: Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me. 
JIM: Oh. Adorable, right?  I walked in on someone in the bathroom. 
JIM: Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam. 
JIM: Oh. Any team sports? 
JIM: Oh. Hadn't noticed. 
JIM: Oh. He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself. 
JIM: Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though. 
JIM: Oh. Is that like your new thing? 
JIM: Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece? Mr. 
JIM: Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that. 
JIM: Oh. Let me get it. 
JIM: Oh. Like nobody. 
JIM: Oh. Oh! 
JIM: Oh. Oh... 
JIM: Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later. 
JIM: Oh. Right, that style. 
JIM: Oh. Three nines. 
JIM: Oh. Two kisses. 
JIM: Oh. Um  David 
JIM: Oh. Um. I think we're good. 
JIM: Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with. 
JIM: Oh. Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking. 
JIM: Oh... 
JIM: Oh... 
JIM: Oh... 
JIM: Oh... Good. 
JIM: Oh... lets take the tour Pam. 
JIM: Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze. 
JIM: Oh... my apartment's on fire 
JIM: Oh... oh! 
JIM: Ohh! Good-bye. 
JIM: Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time?  
JIM: Ohh..  
JIM: Ohh... 
JIM: Ohhh... 
JIM: Ok 
JIM: Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer. 
JIM: Ok great. 
JIM: OK Ryan 
JIM: Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair. 
JIM: OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things. 
JIM: Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to... 
JIM: OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured. 
JIM: OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. ] Jim Halpert. 
JIM: Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened? 
JIM: OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so- 
JIM: OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me.  No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please? 
JIM: OK, great. 
JIM: OK, great. 
JIM: Ok, great. 
JIM: Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael. 
JIM: OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday. 
JIM: Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one . Originally given by Benito Mussolini. 
JIM: OK, I don t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so. 
JIM: Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands.  
JIM: Ok, I said average. 
JIM: OK, I think I can help here. 
JIM: OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation. 
JIM: Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something. 
JIM: Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips. 
JIM: OK, I'll call the real police. 
JIM: OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later.   That was a good story. 
JIM: OK, I'm going back to work. 
JIM: OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the 
JIM: OK, I'm gonna go into this office here  to do some work. So I will be in here. 
JIM: OK, Kenny. 
JIM: OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off. 
JIM: Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind. 
JIM: OK, OK, so you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing "Son of a Preacher Man" and everyone's just staring at her. 
JIM: OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box. 
JIM: Ok, Roy? 
JIM: Ok, say please. 
JIM: Ok, sending. 
JIM: OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting. 
JIM: OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know. 
JIM: OK, sure. Let's do it.  
JIM: Ok, sure. Will do. 
JIM: OK, thank you for ... this. 
JIM: Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work. 
JIM: Ok, thanks. 
JIM: Ok, um, this is   I ll be right back. 
JIM: Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right? 
JIM: OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop. 
JIM: Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my 
JIM: OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies. 
JIM: Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front. 
JIM: Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk. 
JIM: OK, what are you -- 
JIM: Ok, where is he? 
JIM: OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake? 
JIM: OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you. 
JIM: OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential. 
JIM: Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that? 
JIM: OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control... 
JIM: Ok, you're on. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: OK. 
JIM: OK. 
JIM: OK. 
JIM: OK. 
JIM: OK. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: Ok. 
JIM: OK. 
JIM: OK. 
JIM: OK. 
JIM: OK.  
JIM: OK.  This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball. 
JIM: OK.  What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work. 
JIM: OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude. 
JIM: OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly. 
JIM: OK. All right. 
JIM: OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me. 
JIM: Ok. Bye. 
JIM: OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface. 
JIM: OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan. 
JIM: Ok. Good talk. 
JIM: Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it. 
JIM: OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... ... spy on our other branch. No no no. 
JIM: OK. JIM9334  : Let's meet for lunch. 
JIM: Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael? 
JIM: OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails? 
JIM: OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use   uh, oh -- Snoopy. 
JIM: Ok. Remember Spider face? 
JIM: Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, " You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you." 
JIM: Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated. 
JIM: OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad. 
JIM: OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm? 
JIM: Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?  
JIM: OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right? 
JIM: OK. You know what? Here we go.   Uh, everybody? I just want to make an announcement. Pam and I are engaged. 
JIM: Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me. 
JIM: Ok... 
JIM: OK... 
JIM: OK... 
JIM: Ok... 
JIM: Ok...that's not... 
JIM: Okay .. 
JIM: Okay alright.  I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married. 
JIM: Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you! 
JIM: Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey. 
JIM: Okay now really think hard about this 
JIM: Okay that's five. 
JIM: Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh. 
JIM: Okay! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all- 
JIM: Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number. 
JIM: Okay, "A," Halbert. And, "B," I think a more appropriate statement would be, "The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests." 
JIM: Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again. 
JIM: Okay, back to the old grind. 
JIM: Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart. 
JIM: Okay, bye.  So sorry about that. 
JIM: Okay, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it? 
JIM: Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers. 
JIM: Okay, done. 
JIM: Okay, don't be gross. 
JIM: Okay, Dwight  Dwight  Dwight, Dwight Dwight!  uh  
JIM: Okay, Dwight, come on.  You can go first. Old 
JIM: Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so-- 
JIM: Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul. 
JIM: Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise. 
JIM: Okay, good then. 
JIM: Okay, good. Stay right here. 
JIM: Okay, great- 
JIM: Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this- 
JIM: Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn t going to show up? 
JIM: Okay, I am not dying here. Come on.   
JIM: Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here. Dwight, Jim and 
JIM: Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them. 
JIM: Okay, I ll call you right back. 
JIM: Okay, I ll do it. 
JIM: Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax. 
JIM: Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch? 
JIM: Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense." 
JIM: Okay, I'll just go get the other guy. 
JIM: Okay, I'll try.   
JIM: Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice. 
JIM: Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud. 
JIM: Okay, I'm not doing every number. 
JIM: Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly? 
JIM: Okay, it s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make. 
JIM: Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money. 
JIM: Okay, just relax. Just need to relax. 
JIM: Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil? 
JIM: Okay, just talk. 
JIM: Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage... 
JIM: Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen? 
JIM: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome. I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes. And the winner is, employee number nine. And that is? 
JIM: Okay, let's go. 
JIM: Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth. 
JIM: Okay, listen. 
JIM: Okay, man, easy. 
JIM: Okay, maybe we should talk specifics. 
JIM: Okay, Michael! Focus! 
JIM: Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these. 
JIM: Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out. 
JIM: Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly- 
JIM: Okay, okay, it's no big deal. So you're not a computer geek. 
JIM: Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it. 
JIM: Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud. 
JIM: Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you re not the best with the phone. 
JIM: Okay, okay. 
JIM: Okay, okay. 
JIM: Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player?  
JIM: Okay, okay... 
JIM: Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter? 
JIM: Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now? 
JIM: Okay, quick. Who says moustache?  
JIM: Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody? 
JIM: Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good. 
JIM: Okay, so-- 
JIM: Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake. 
JIM: Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can... 
JIM: Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit. 
JIM: Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants? 
JIM: Okay, so we're good. 
JIM: Okay, so what do you want to do? 
JIM: Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's-- 
JIM: Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela. 
JIM: Okay, someone look it up. 
JIM: Okay, sorry, sorry. 
JIM: Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one. 
JIM: Okay, that is a "no" on the on the West Side Market. 
JIM: Okay, the limo s gonna be here at five. I need everybody to be ready  cause I want to pack in a lot. 
JIM: Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face? 
JIM: Okay, they're fine. They're adults. 
JIM: Okay, this was pretty simple- 
JIM: Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies. 
JIM: Okay, wait, I was not... I did not- 
JIM: Okay, wait, wait. 
JIM: Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry.  Sorry. I think I'm just hungry. 
JIM: Okay, what can I do to make you believe me? 
JIM: Okay, what was this look?  
JIM: Okay, will do. 
JIM: Okay, you could just show up late though. 
JIM: Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl. 
JIM: Okay, you know what? 
JIM: Okay, you know what? I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do? 
JIM: Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know... 
JIM: Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because... 
JIM: Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here. 
JIM: Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me. 
JIM: Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the...  
JIM: Okay, your move. 
JIM: Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that. 
JIM: Okay. 
JIM: Okay. 
JIM: Okay. 
JIM: Okay.

JIM: Okay.  Just gotta... 
JIM: Okay.  Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss. 
JIM: Okay. All right, come on.  Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip. 
JIM: Okay. And how do you feel? 
JIM: Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone? 
JIM: Okay. But what is he more famous for? 
JIM: Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later. Co-worker 
JIM: Okay. Do you want me to stay? 
JIM: Okay. I can t say that that s not fair. 
JIM: Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine. 
JIM: Okay. I ll see you in a little bit. 
JIM: Okay. I ll talk to you tomorrow. 
JIM: Okay. I m really sorry I told the guys I d be there for the board meeting. 
JIM: Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth. 
JIM: Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple s counseling. 
JIM: Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip. 
JIM: Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen? 
JIM: Okay. Let's start with the "I love you" level. 
JIM: Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon.  
JIM: Okay. Okay.  
JIM: Okay. Okay. Okay. 
JIM: Okay. Phyllis. 
JIM: Okay. See you guys. 
JIM: Okay. Sounds good. 
JIM: Okay. Sshh. I know.  
JIM: Okay. Thank you. 
JIM: Okay. Thanks.  Animal control will be here at six. 
JIM: Okay. That is me, but I didn't order the cake. 
JIM: Okay. The annex it is. I ll be sitting at your desk if that s okay with you. 
JIM: Okay. There s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something. 
JIM: Okay. This is it. 
JIM: Okay. Thought people read more books. 
JIM: Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good?  
JIM: Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper. 
JIM: Okay. Um... Got you something. 
JIM: Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things. 
JIM: Okay. We ll, just forget it. 
JIM: Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant. 
JIM: O-Kay. Woman 
JIM: Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets. 
JIM: Okay. You don t need my help? 
JIM: Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me? 
JIM: Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options. 
JIM: Okay...  
JIM: Okay...  
JIM: Okay... Holly's back. 
JIM: On a wing and a prayer, mostly. 
JIM: On what? 
JIM: Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds. 
JIM: Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change. 
JIM: One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go. 
JIM: One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then. 
JIM: One more. Why are you talking like that? 
JIM: One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five? 
JIM: One. 
JIM: Only two hundred dollars? 
JIM: Oof.  Infertility.  
JIM: Ooh! 
JIM: Ooh! Are you nuts? 
JIM: OOH! Boom! Face! 
JIM: Ooh, definitely in my top five. 
JIM: Ooh, easy. That's not it at all. 
JIM: Ooh, go easy with the shaking. 
JIM: Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don t worry, he s the best in the biz. 
JIM: Ooh, me three. 
JIM: Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog.  Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy? 
JIM: Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too. Todd 
JIM: Ooh, what about, uh, Dwight's dojo? 
JIM: Ooh. 
JIM: Ooh. 
JIM: Ooh. 
JIM: Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in? 
JIM: Oooh! You can't handle the truth!  
JIM: OooOK. 
JIM: Oops, that s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out? 
JIM: Oops.  
JIM: Or a gong. 
JIM: Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be... Can we get a late checkout? I don't... I don't think she heard me. 
JIM: Or maybe he's just stuck in character. 
JIM: Or zipadeedoodaah. 
JIM: Oscar! Uh, what is going on? 
JIM: Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog? 
JIM: Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it. 
JIM: Oscar? 
JIM: Our fake winnings 
JIM: Ow! 
JIM: Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard. 
JIM: Ow, What are you doing?  
JIM: Ow. 
JIM: Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True  Oh no. 
JIM: Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems. 
JIM: Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center. 
JIM: Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant. 
JIM: Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird. 
JIM: Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago. 
JIM: Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home. 
JIM: Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman.  
JIM: Pam never seemed to have a problem with us. 
JIM: Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good. 
JIM: Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods. 
JIM: Pam! 
JIM: Pam! You can't be serious. 
JIM: Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test? 
JIM: Pam, don't worry about it. 
JIM: Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic. 
JIM: Pam, I couldn t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call. 
JIM: Pam, I m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I m not going over this again. 
JIM: Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works. 
JIM: Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that.  Really? Smirking? 
JIM: Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared. 
JIM: Pam, it just happened. 
JIM: Pam, it wasn't her. 
JIM: Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend. 
JIM: Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now. 
JIM: Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital. 
JIM: Pam, play by the rules. 
JIM: Pam, will you marry me? 
JIM: Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale. 
JIM: Pam. 
JIM: Pam. 
JIM: Pam. 
JIM: Pam. 
JIM: Pam. 
JIM: Pam. 
JIM: Pam.  Sorry.  Um, are you free for dinner tonight? 
JIM: Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything. 
JIM: Pam? 
JIM: Pam? 
JIM: Pam? 
JIM: Pam? 
JIM: Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something? 
JIM: Pam? Get us back into it. 
JIM: Pam? No! 
JIM: Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good. 
JIM: Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy. Uh... June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that. 
JIM: Pam's sales are fine actually. 
JIM: Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on. 
JIM: Party looks fun doesn t it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer. 
JIM: Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life. 
JIM: Paul Anka. 
JIM: Peepa. 
JIM: Penny for your thoughts. 
JIM: Perfect! 
JIM: Perfect. 
JIM: Perfect. 
JIM: Perfect. 
JIM: Perfect. 
JIM: Perfect.  
JIM: Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody. 
JIM: Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really- 
JIM: Perform a test. 
JIM: Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy. 
JIM: Permission denied. 
JIM: Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds. 
JIM: Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit? 
JIM: Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be? 
JIM: Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over. 
JIM: Phillies fan, though, right? 
JIM: Phoenix Sun's point guard? 
JIM: Phyllis and Robert. 
JIM: Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton. 
JIM: Phyllis says the same twelve clich s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates. 
JIM: Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course. 
JIM: Phyllis! Wow. 
JIM: Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or-- 
JIM: Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie. 
JIM: Please do. 
JIM: Please stop. 
JIM: Please stop. People are having a Christmas party. 
JIM: Please? 
JIM: Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there. 
JIM: Ponies. 
JIM: Porque es muy rapido. 
JIM: Potential future nonsense. 
JIM: Prank!  
JIM: Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well. 
JIM: Pretty amazing. 
JIM: Pretty good. 
JIM: Pretty good. You must be almost out of water. 
JIM: Pretty sure everyone heard that. 
JIM: Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So... 
JIM: Private Room. 
JIM: Pro-- no favoritism. 
JIM: Probably another high-school student. School 
JIM: Probably just Kelly. 
JIM: Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually. But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers. 
JIM: Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone. 
JIM: Probably. 
JIM: Prove it. 
JIM: Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer? 
JIM: Puerto Rico was awesome. 
JIM: Pull over, pull over! 
JIM: Pull up your pants. 
JIM: Punishment fits the crime. Jessica 
JIM: Puppet. 
JIM: Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in? 
JIM: Quick 
JIM: Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy. 
JIM: Quick phone call from you guys, keep going, 
JIM: Quick question - do you play the guitar? 
JIM: Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list? 
JIM: Rank each person individually? 
JIM: Ransom. 
JIM: Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them. 
JIM: Ready? 
JIM: Ready? 
JIM: Ready? 
JIM: Ready? One, two, three... 
JIM: Really did  He responded L-O-L. 
JIM: Really for like how long? 
JIM: Really was. 
JIM: Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office. 
JIM: Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today. 
JIM: Really, what kind of celebrity? 
JIM: Really. 
JIM: Really. 
JIM: Really. 
JIM: Really... 
JIM: Really? 
JIM: Really? 
JIM: Really?

JIM: Really? 
JIM: Really? 
JIM: Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight. 
JIM: Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short. 
JIM: Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball. 
JIM: Really? Does he do good work or-- 
JIM: Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door? 
JIM: Really? I thought I'd take Roy. 
JIM: Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there Beesley? 
JIM: Really? Not Slytherin? 
JIM: Really? Power gel? 
JIM: Really? Why? 
JIM: Really? Wow... that's bad. 
JIM: Really? You just agreed to that? 
JIM: Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great. 
JIM: Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you? 
JIM: Resent you? 
JIM: Respectable? 
JIM: Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face. 
JIM: Right here. 
JIM: Right in the sweet spot. I think you re gonna be really happy. 
JIM: Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train. 
JIM: Right now? 
JIM: Right there!  
JIM: Right! 
JIM: Right!  Hey, what's up? Everything ok? 
JIM: Right! Exactly.  Knew I could count on you.  
JIM: Right, cause that's what we are talking about. 
JIM: Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back. 
JIM: Right, the one from England. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: Right. 
JIM: -Right. 
JIM: Right. It's city and country combined. 
JIM: Right. Let's do some good. 
JIM: Right. Of course.  "The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert." Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter. 
JIM: Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident. 
JIM: Right... That's good. 
JIM: Right? 
JIM: Right? 
JIM: Right? 
JIM: Right?  Ryan 
JIM: Right? I was just thinking... 
JIM: Right? So, uh, let's uh... 
JIM: Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way. 
JIM: Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical. 
JIM: Robert. 
JIM: Robert? 
JIM: Roy said that. 
JIM: Ryan Howard. Ryan!  Gold medal. 
JIM: Ryan? A little help? 
JIM: Sales form for you to sign. 
JIM: Sales. 
JIM: Sally. 
JIM: Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that. 
JIM: Scones. 
JIM: Screw  em. 
JIM: 'Scuse me? 
JIM: Second drink? 
JIM: Second line. 
JIM: Second-in-command to Michael. 
JIM: See how easy that is? 
JIM: See what? 
JIM: See ya. 
JIM: See ya. 
JIM: See ya. Nice girl. 
JIM: See ya. See ya.   Bye! 
JIM: See you tomorrow, Dwight. 
JIM: See you. 
JIM: See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour. It's- 
JIM: See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you. 
JIM: See? 
JIM: Seriously! 
JIM: Seriously? 
JIM: Seriously? 
JIM: Seriously? You're going to sit in the back? 
JIM: Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary. 
JIM: Shawn Marion. 
JIM: She could put the cup right there. 
JIM: She dies. 
JIM: She does not like him. 
JIM: She is dating Ryan, I think. 
JIM: She knew it. 
JIM: She looks at it when she s on the potty, and she makes the faces. 
JIM: She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that s fine. 
JIM: She said lots of things. 
JIM: She wants it bad Michael. 
JIM: She was always engaged. 
JIM: She... 
JIM: She'd be perfect for you. 
JIM: She's amazing. This is very exciting. 
JIM: She's engaged, um... to me. 
JIM: She's engaged. 
JIM: She's not really my type. 
JIM: She's not your grandmother, is she? 
JIM: She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great. 
JIM: She's wearing a onesie  
JIM: She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school. 
JIM: She's... high-maintenance. 
JIM: Shh! 
JIM: Shh. 
JIM: Shhh. 
JIM: Shoot.  
JIM: Show him how to use it. 
JIM: Showtime! 
JIM: Shuckin  the peas. You should go back to the first part, though. You are gonna cover for me? 
JIM: Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done. 
JIM: Shut up. 
JIM: Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90. 
JIM: Si, senor. 
JIM: Si. 
JIM: Silence. 
JIM: Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it. 
JIM: Six dollars. 
JIM: Six of one, really. 
JIM: Six on seven. 
JIM: Six point five days.   
JIM: Six. You? 
JIM: Six-month anniversary. What? 
JIM: Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator. 
JIM: Smart. 
JIM: Smart. Ryan 
JIM: Smasher! 
JIM: So Andy is in rare form today. 
JIM: So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning. Pam  : I'm not drunk. 
JIM: So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so... 
JIM: So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised.  And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high. 
JIM: So beautiful.  Hey-- 
JIM: So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you. 
JIM: So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box? 
JIM: So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me. 
JIM: So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us. 
JIM: So good. 
JIM: So happy right now.  
JIM: So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse. 
JIM: So how does it work? It s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or  
JIM: So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great. 
JIM: So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one. 
JIM: So I guess I can assume that was personal. 
JIM: So I guess I can't get up. 
JIM: So I guess I'll just... work on my short game. 
JIM: So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city. 
JIM: So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right? 
JIM: So instead of working, you want... 
JIM: So instead, you screwed me? 
JIM: So let's have it at the hospital. 
JIM: So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it? 
JIM: So maybe you're not completely ethical after all. 
JIM: So Pam was right? 
JIM: So sadly, it's the best idea on the table. 
JIM: So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this. 
JIM: So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them- 
JIM: So tell me again why I can't be part of your club? 
JIM: So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers. 
JIM: So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache. 
JIM: So then, why didn't you do it? 
JIM: So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it. 
JIM: So this is fun. 
JIM: So this is my life. Until I win the lottery . Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books. 
JIM: So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years.  Years. 
JIM: So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two.  This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel. 
JIM: So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there. 
JIM: So weird. 
JIM: So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight? 
JIM: So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye. 
JIM: So what are you going to do? 
JIM: So what did he say? Was it my fault? 
JIM: So what do you think? 
JIM: So what is going on, girl in the computer? 
JIM: So what is the problem? 
JIM: So what's in the box? 
JIM: So what's your strategy for this race? 
JIM: So why did you come in here? 
JIM: So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now? 
JIM: So you have the directions. 
JIM: So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word "Philadelphia"? 
JIM: So you like her? 
JIM: So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital. 
JIM: So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly? 
JIM: So you're not doing it. 
JIM: So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can. 
JIM: So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager? 
JIM: So, don't tell. 
JIM: So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael. 
JIM: So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot? 
JIM: So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much. 
JIM: So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God. 
JIM: So, I guess I'll see you in  ten hours. 
JIM: So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now. 
JIM: So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period. 
JIM: So, it's not the dumbest idea. 
JIM: So, next interview has to be better. 
JIM: So, none of that tipped you off? 
JIM: So, none of them? 
JIM: So, not prison. 
JIM: So, terrible idea. 
JIM: So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly? 
JIM: So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant. 
JIM: So, the situation is the worst. 
JIM: So, this hot chocolate thing. 
JIM: So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that ll print out Hey. Meet your new desk mate. 
JIM: So, we should let him go. 
JIM: So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too. 
JIM: So, what is this special project? 
JIM: So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager. 
JIM: So, where are you shipping your foot? 
JIM: So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone? 
JIM: So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs. 
JIM: So, you ready for the... the Dundies? 
JIM: So. 
JIM: So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions? 
JIM: So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back. 
JIM: So... 
JIM: So... how 'bout let's not? 
JIM: So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive. 
JIM: So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control? 
JIM: So...ah, who's gonna take the dog? 
JIM: So? 
JIM: S'ok. 
JIM: Solitaire? 
JIM: Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all. 
JIM: Some might even say that we had our first date last night. 
JIM: Someone's in a bad mood. 
JIM: Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into? 
JIM: Sometime today. 
JIM: Son, you have to talk louder. 
JIM: Sorry about that. 
JIM: Sorry, how long have you been showing the house? 
JIM: Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing. 
JIM: Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby. 
JIM: Sorry, man, I can t focus on zingers. There s too many potential clients. 
JIM: Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you? 
JIM: Sorry, Stinky, can t do it. Too busy. 
JIM: Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...? 
JIM: Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing. 
JIM: Sorry. 
JIM: Sorry. 
JIM: Sorry. I no, no, no, what I meant what I meant actually was  
JIM: Sorry. That was a family emergency. 
JIM: Sounded good. 
JIM: Sounds complicated. 
JIM: Sounds good Andy. 
JIM: Sounds good. 
JIM: Sounds good. 
JIM: Sounds like every other party. 
JIM: Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler. 
JIM: Sounds tough. 
JIM: Sounds tough. When you're a Jet,  you're a Jet all the way, right? 
JIM: Space dust. 
JIM: Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks? 
JIM: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! 
JIM: Split the difference? 
JIM: Spot on. 
JIM: Stanley doesn't have a moustache. 
JIM: Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice? 
JIM: Stanley, are you listening to music? 
JIM: Stanley, please, this is serious! 
JIM: Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games? 
JIM: Stanley. Stanley. 
JIM: Stanley. Uhh  you know what? Just bring back those bottles! 
JIM: Stanley? 
JIM: Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up. 
JIM: Stay in bed! 
JIM: Still decorative. 
JIM: Still haven't left the house yet, huh? 
JIM: Still no. 
JIM: Still nothin'. 
JIM: Still want that. 
JIM: Stop  
JIM: Stop it! It's gonna be great. 
JIM: Stop right there. I love it. 
JIM: Stop shoving me. 
JIM: Stop what? 
JIM: Stop! 
JIM: Stop! Stop! 
JIM: Stop, stop, stop. 
JIM: Stop. 
JIM: Stop. 
JIM: Stop. 
JIM: Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy? 
JIM: Stop. That's disgusting. 
JIM: Stop. What? 
JIM: Story's kinda bland. It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor. 
JIM: Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation. 
JIM: Striker! 
JIM: Strongly-painted picture. 
JIM: Stupid. Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes.   Dumb. 
JIM: Such a dork. 
JIM: Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days. How's your summer? 
JIM: Sure glad you're back. 
JIM: Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys.  Can I have your sunglasses? 
JIM: Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good. 
JIM: Sure we'll go. 
JIM: Sure you do, Dwight. Sure. 
JIM: Sure you don't want the teapot? 
JIM: Sure! 
JIM: Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service? 
JIM: Sure, what's up? 
JIM: Sure, yeah, go ahead. 
JIM: Sure, yeah.  Hollywood.  Alright. 
JIM: Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do. 
JIM: Sure. 
JIM: Sure. 
JIM: Sure. 
JIM: Sure. 
JIM: Sure. 
JIM: Sure. 
JIM: Sure. Let me just finish this turn. 
JIM: Sure. Look at you! 
JIM: Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right? 
JIM: Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing? 
JIM: Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to- 
JIM: Sure. That they should do one. 
JIM: Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun. 
JIM: Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months. 
JIM: Take care of my wife. I will be back. 
JIM: Take it easy. 
JIM: Take it easy. 
JIM: Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need...  
JIM: Talk to me. 
JIM: 'Talla-nasty', very clever. 
JIM: Tell 'em. 
JIM: Tell me about it. 
JIM: Tell me about the cologne. How much? 
JIM: Ten. It was the full ten. 
JIM: Terrible. Totally unconvincing. 
JIM: Thank you Angela. 
JIM: Thank you for choosing me. 
JIM: Thank you very much. 
JIM: Thank you very much. It was fun. 
JIM: Thank you, accounting department. 
JIM: Thank you, delegate from Iceland. 
JIM: Thank you, Dwight. 
JIM: Thank you, Meredith. 
JIM: Thank you, Mr. Schnoot.  We will let you know. 
JIM: Thank you, sir.  
JIM: Thank you, thank you. OK. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JIM: Thank you. Andy and 
JIM: Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20. 
JIM: Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip. 
JIM: Thank you. Improv 
JIM: Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings. 
JIM: Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it. 
JIM: Thank you. Robert 
JIM: Thank you. You know what, screw this!  
JIM: Thank you. Your mom is a treasure. 
JIM: Thanks a lot guys, Good job. 
JIM: Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it.  Hey! How are you? 
JIM: Thanks for inviting us, by the way- 
JIM: Thanks for the head's up, Kev. 
JIM: Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go. 
JIM: Thanks Janet. 
JIM: Thanks man. 
JIM: Thanks Meredith. 
JIM: Thanks Michael. 
JIM: Thanks Phyl. 
JIM: Thanks! 
JIM: Thanks, Charles. 
JIM: Thanks, Kev. I'm good though. 
JIM: Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date. 
JIM: Thanks, Pam. 
JIM: Thanks, thanks Dana. 
JIM: Thanks, yeah. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks. 
JIM: Thanks.   
JIM: That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out. 
JIM: That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot. 
JIM: That did. Pretty huge laugh. 
JIM: That doesn't exist anymore. 
JIM: That doesn't make sense, couldn't be. 
JIM: That doesn't matter. 
JIM: That I thought we were millionaires. 
JIM: That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales. 
JIM: That is a lie, that is a lie. 
JIM: That is a lot of liquor. 
JIM: That is a mistake. 
JIM: That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right? 
JIM: That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party. 
JIM: That is good. 
JIM: That is me. Wish me luck. 
JIM: That is not the expression. 
JIM: That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager. 
JIM: That is weird. 
JIM: That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike. 
JIM: That makes sense. 
JIM: That might be a little difficult with the one computer. 
JIM: That must be really fun for you and Marci huh? 
JIM: That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight. 
JIM: That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today? 
JIM: That s all right. 
JIM: That s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing? 
JIM: That s funny. Ok. 
JIM: That s kind of an impossible question. 
JIM: That s not it. 
JIM: That s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office? 
JIM: That s pretty good. I feel safe. David 
JIM: That s pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points? 
JIM: That s so great! 
JIM: That s true, yeah. 
JIM: That s why it s so clean. 
JIM: That seems inconsiderate. 
JIM: That sounds awesome. 
JIM: That sounds bad. 
JIM: That sounds fun. 
JIM: That sounds lovely. 
JIM: That sounds terrible. 
JIM: That was a great idea. 
JIM: That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great. 
JIM: That was like, ten years ago. 
JIM: That was one time- 
JIM: That was really good, Darryl. 
JIM: That was really rough. 
JIM: That was the moment that you knew you liked me? 
JIM: That was, that was a surprise. 
JIM: That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing? 
JIM: That will inevitably lead to mocking. So... 
JIM: That would be fun. 
JIM: That would be great, thank you. Andy and 
JIM: That'd be great. 
JIM: That's- 
JIM: That's- 
JIM: That's--  the password. We're in. 
JIM: That's a bummer. OK, then we need to... Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing. 
JIM: That's a common mistake. 
JIM: That's a good one.  Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub? 
JIM: That's a great idea. 
JIM: That's a guarantee. 
JIM: That's a lot of reasons!  
JIM: That's about it, yeah. 
JIM: That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission.  Hey, are you hungry? 
JIM: That's all right. 
JIM: That's all right. 
JIM: That's alright. 
JIM: That's also not true. 
JIM: That's amazing. 
JIM: That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right? 
JIM: That's an overreaction. 
JIM: That's awesome. 
JIM: That's awesome. 
JIM: That's because Mark's my roommate. 
JIM: That's cool. 
JIM: That's cool. 
JIM: That's exactly what Wallace told us. 
JIM: That's fine. 
JIM: That's good. You know, with the kid. 
JIM: That's great 
JIM: that's great. 
JIM: That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can .. 
JIM: That's harsh. 
JIM: That's him. 
JIM: That's honest.  Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it? 
JIM: That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag... Oh my god. 
JIM: That's impossible.  Dwight! 
JIM: That's increadible. 
JIM: That's inspired. 
JIM: That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think? 
JIM: That's it. 
JIM: That's it. 
JIM: That's it. 
JIM: That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way. 
JIM: That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear. 
JIM: That's it. Or Mr. Peanut. 
JIM: That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today? 
JIM: That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food. 
JIM: That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler. 
JIM: That's nice. 
JIM: That's nice. 
JIM: That's not a good idea. 
JIM: That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me. 
JIM: That's not how that works. 
JIM: That's not it. 
JIM: That's not okay. 
JIM: That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually. 
JIM: That's not the point. 
JIM: That's not true. 
JIM: That's not what I meant. 
JIM: That's not what that is. 
JIM: That's OK, we're good. 
JIM: That's okay, I'll do it. 
JIM: That's okay. 
JIM: That's pretty funny. 
JIM: That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh... 
JIM: That's pretty good. 
JIM: That's really not cool. 
JIM: That's right. 
JIM: That's right. 
JIM: That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back. 
JIM: That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one.  
JIM: That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television. 
JIM: That's the Christmas spirit. 
JIM: That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content." What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you.  Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second. 
JIM: That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's 
JIM: That's Toys R Us, I think. 
JIM: That's true. That's right. Yeah. 
JIM: That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much. 
JIM: That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with? 
JIM: That's very... 
JIM: That's what I thought. 
JIM: That's what I want. 
JIM: That's what I'm saying. 
JIM: That's what she said. 
JIM: That's what who said? 
JIM: That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink. 
JIM: That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so... 
JIM: That's... not okay. 
JIM: The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful...  Oh well. 
JIM: The Beets Motel? That is, wow. 
JIM: The best news is, we're going to have a baby today. 
JIM: The big gun thing.  Stop! 
JIM: The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings. 
JIM: The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then. 
JIM: The empanada guy! 
JIM: The future mother of my children. 
JIM: The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding. 
JIM: The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did. 
JIM: The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I m not risking that again. 
JIM: The KGB will wait for no one!   
JIM: The last  
JIM: The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn? 
JIM: The mall? 
JIM: The minister just told me that it s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom. 
JIM: The mob, maybe NASA. 
JIM: The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute. 
JIM: The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It s strange. 
JIM: The new guys called one. 
JIM: The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says "You wanted me" enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had. 
JIM: The next year he really stepped things up. 
JIM: The ocean. 
JIM: The one I have. I'll use the one I have. 
JIM: The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty. 
JIM: The raise isn't real. 
JIM: The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here. 
JIM: The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it. 
JIM: The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California  for the manager position. Who took one look around and left. He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill. And he chose  
JIM: The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes! 
JIM: The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats. 
JIM: The temp? 
JIM: The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult. 
JIM: The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was... was in the... 
JIM: Theater. 
JIM: Their bread is very good. 
JIM: Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved? 
JIM: Then take a different way home, man! 
JIM: Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember. 
JIM: Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter? 
JIM: There are other reasons to go to Ohio. 
JIM: There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are. 
JIM: There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys. 
JIM: There is one condition, Michael. 
JIM: There is soda inside. 
JIM: There it is. 
JIM: There it is. 
JIM: There it is. Alright. 
JIM: There s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume. 
JIM: There s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor   David 
JIM: There s actually not a rule that says that. 
JIM: There they are. 
JIM: There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit. 
JIM: There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey! 
JIM: There. Now we're even.  
JIM: There's a little more to it. 
JIM: There's a table over here. 
JIM: There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids. 
JIM: There's like ten green ones. 
JIM: There's the charm. 
JIM: There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for. 
JIM: There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it. 
JIM: There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity. 
JIM: These are actually forks and knives from the break room. 
JIM: These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal.  
JIM: They are terrible. 
JIM: They re terrible. 
JIM: They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along. 
JIM: They think it was Mose. 
JIM: They weren t really talking that much about money. They just said, We re good with investing and then I...and I... 
JIM: They're for her to look at, Michael. 
JIM: They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now.  
JIM: They're probably worthless. 
JIM: Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that s only gonna make things worse. 
JIM: Think you can let go? 
JIM: This came out really well.  There you go. 
JIM: This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, "just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear." 
JIM: This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay. 
JIM: This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out. 
JIM: This is actually a big potential sale, so... 
JIM: This is all we have. 
JIM: This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now. 
JIM: This is dangerous. 
JIM: This is gonna be awful. 
JIM: This is great. 
JIM: This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh - 
JIM: This is happening. 
JIM: This is hilarious, but we re gonna stop with all-- 
JIM: This is impressive. 
JIM: This is Jim. David 
JIM: This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right? 
JIM: This is my desk. 
JIM: This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that s for fueling only. No savoring. 
JIM: This is really not how this is supposed to happen. 
JIM: This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah. 
JIM: This is way more than I make now. 
JIM: This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left. 
JIM: This one taken? No. Good. 
JIM: This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue. 
JIM: This shouldn't happen at work. 
JIM: This was my decision, not yours. 
JIM: This, man. I can t do this to Pam. 
JIM: This... is Parkour.  Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive.  The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital. 
JIM: This... is the future, because... This is the past. I ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain.  
JIM: Those are the doves. 
JIM: Those flowers are nice. 
JIM: Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger. 
JIM: Threat 
JIM: Three months. 
JIM: Three times. 
JIM: Three yeses. I will see you titans of industry upstairs. 
JIM: Three, two, one!  
JIM: Tickets are 250 bucks. 
JIM: Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come.  Guys? 
JIM: Time. Space. Gender.  There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it.  No, that s -- 
JIM: To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people. 
JIM: To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back? 
JIM: To both these bears. 
JIM: To get married. 
JIM: To madness. 
JIM: To the shame room!  
JIM: To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle. 
JIM: To waiting. 
JIM: To what? 
JIM: Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off. 
JIM: Toby works here again. 
JIM: Toby. 
JIM: Toby? Mm hmm.  I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth... 
JIM: Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much.  I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon. 
JIM: Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there. 
JIM: Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon. 
JIM: Today of all days... 
JIM: Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager. 
JIM: Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try. Phil 
JIM: Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it. 
JIM: Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building.   She's gonna love it. Right? 
JIM: Tom Cruise! 
JIM: Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually. 
JIM: Tonight, hopefully. 
JIM: Tony the tiger. You don't hear that much any more. 
JIM: Too late, Kev. 
JIM: Too loud. 
JIM: Too much now. 
JIM: Too, too loud. Too Loud. 
JIM: Topical. 
JIM: Total nightmare. 
JIM: Totally reasonable. 
JIM: Totally, no problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or... 
JIM: Touche? 
JIM: Tour, let's do the tour first. 
JIM: Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So... 
JIM: Travel. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be... really nice. Gonna find myself. 
JIM: Truce? 
JIM: True love's kiss. 
JIM: Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering. 
JIM: Trust me. 
JIM: Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank.   Oh, text message from my brother. "Pam cool. Welcome to the family." 
JIM: Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out. 
JIM: Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird. 
JIM: Two for two, keep it up. 
JIM: Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah. 
JIM: Two minutes... 
JIM: Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together. 
JIM: Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance. 
JIM: Ugh. 
JIM: Uh- 
JIM: Uh-- 
JIM: Uh-- 
JIM: Uh   Well, it s about Athlead. I m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call? 
JIM: Uh  yeah, I'm just watching basketball. 
JIM: Uh hmm, definitely. 
JIM: Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan. 
JIM: Uh hmm. 
JIM: Uh hmm. 
JIM: Uh huh. 
JIM: Uh hum. 
JIM: Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten. Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing. 
JIM: Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while. 
JIM: Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier. 
JIM: Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small- Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby! 
JIM: Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off. 
JIM: Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility. 
JIM: Uh, hit and run. 
JIM: Uh, hmm.  Uh, hmm. What else? 
JIM: Uh, how did you know they were black belts? 
JIM: Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay. 
JIM: Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key. 
JIM: Uh, I don't know, let me ask.  Uh, were you quilled? 
JIM: Uh, I heard it. 
JIM: Uh, I really don't want to talk about it. 
JIM: Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it. 
JIM: Uh, I think you dropped this  
JIM: Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad. 
JIM: Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight. 
JIM: Uh, it's in the lot. Hospital 
JIM: Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work. 
JIM: Uh, Kitchen. 
JIM: Uh, Larissa Halpert. 
JIM: Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten... 
JIM: Uh, Michael. 
JIM: Uh, my ex-fianc . 
JIM: Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage. 
JIM: Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert s notebook. 
JIM: Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight s night, okay? 
JIM: Uh, no. Nope. Not really. 
JIM: Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion. 
JIM: Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four. 
JIM: Uh, Ryan can never know. 
JIM: Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car. 
JIM: Uh, that is an invitation to an online party. 
JIM: Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record! 
JIM: Uh, uh, ok. 
JIM: Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--  
JIM: Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can t give 100% to two things at once you know. 
JIM: Uh, Wellington systems? Sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or, were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me. 
JIM: Uh, what does -- what does that mean? 
JIM: Uh, what happened to that video I sent you? 
JIM: Uh, yeah, ream. 
JIM: Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you... 
JIM: Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them. 
JIM: Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else. 
JIM: Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting. 
JIM: Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see. 
JIM: Uh... 
JIM: Uh... 
JIM: Uh... 
JIM: Uh... 
JIM: Uh...  
JIM: Uh... Not a bad day. 
JIM: Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right? 
JIM: Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders. 
JIM: Uhhh, the street? 
JIM: Uhhh. Can't. 
JIM: Uh-huh, yeah. I am. 
JIM: Uh-huh. 
JIM: Uh-huh. 
JIM: Uh-huh. 
JIM: Uh-huh. 
JIM: Uh-huh. 
JIM: um  I mean- 
JIM: Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should-  
JIM: Um, bottomless champagne. 
JIM: Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip. 
JIM: Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material. 
JIM: Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground. 
JIM: Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh,  then...  "How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight." 
JIM: Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk. 
JIM: Um, no. 
JIM: Um, not neccessari... 
JIM: Um, oh man, I don t actually know. 
JIM: Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor. 
JIM: Um, sniper rifle? 
JIM: Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight... 
JIM: Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together. 
JIM: Um, you know what, I actually didn t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish. 
JIM: Um. He sticks to his guns. 
JIM: Um... 
JIM: Um... 
JIM: Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises? 
JIM: Um... 'Cause your condo's in America. 
JIM: Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.' 
JIM: Um... I don't think so. 
JIM: Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted... 
JIM: Um... it's in Maryland. 
JIM: Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling. 
JIM: Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king. 
JIM: Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then... 
JIM: Um... What's in the bag? 
JIM: Um... Whoa.  Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay. 
JIM: Um... why Kelly? 
JIM: Um... yes. 
JIM: Umm . 
JIM: Umm, hmm. 
JIM: Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here? 
JIM: Umm, Michael. 
JIM: Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was -- 
JIM: Umm, what happened? 
JIM: Umm... 
JIM: Umm... 
JIM: Ummm... no idea. 
JIM: Ummm... yup. Yes, we are. 
JIM: Unbelievable. 
JIM: Uncanny. 
JIM: Uncanny.  
JIM: Unfair. When s my birthday? 
JIM: Unforgivable. 
JIM: Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you? 
JIM: Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate. 
JIM: Unless you think he can t handle it. 
JIM: Urkel Grue. 
JIM: Very cute.  
JIM: Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite - 
JIM: Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is. 
JIM: Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis. 
JIM: Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right? 
JIM: Wait a minute, what is this? 
JIM: Wait a minute. 
JIM: Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you d ever set foot in in this town? 
JIM: Wait a second, how are you qualified for that? 
JIM: Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it.  
JIM: Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that. 
JIM: Wait wait wait, who said that? 
JIM: Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about?  
JIM: Wait, are you the patient or the doctor? 
JIM: Wait, I'm serious. It's happening. 
JIM: Wait, should I have left the car running?   
JIM: Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right? 
JIM: Wait, so you installed a doomsday device? 
JIM: Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything? 
JIM: Wait, that's pretty weird. 
JIM: Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun? 
JIM: Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open. 
JIM: Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!  
JIM: Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable. 
JIM: Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly. 
JIM: Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams. 
JIM: Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss. 
JIM: Wait, wait; one thing. Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right? 
JIM: Wait, what? 
JIM: Wait, what? 
JIM: Wait, what? Come on! 
JIM: Wait, when was this? 
JIM: Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen? 
JIM: Wait, you alright? 
JIM: Wait. 
JIM: Wait. Is this your place Dwight? 
JIM: Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both. 
JIM: Wait. What?  You knew? And you didn't say anything? 
JIM: Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case let s get to work. 
JIM: Wait... 
JIM: Wake up.  
JIM: Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here?  Wow. Ok. You got me. 
JIM: Was in the green group. 
JIM: Was it your scores? 
JIM: Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was? 
JIM: Was it? 
JIM: Was that it? No, that wasn't bad. 
JIM: Was that not the-- 
JIM: Was that your mom? 
JIM: Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that. 
JIM: We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company. 
JIM: We are doing worst first dates. 
JIM: We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man. 
JIM: We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly. 
JIM: We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right?  And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe.  Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea. 
JIM: We bonded. We got to-  
JIM: We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks. 
JIM: We can custom make them. 
JIM: We can go. 
JIM: We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time. 
JIM: We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser. 
JIM: We can order in from Hooters. 
JIM: We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on. 
JIM: We can talk about that later. Improv 
JIM: We can't figure that out. 
JIM: We could put that in orange juice. 
JIM: We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing. 
JIM: We definitely are. At 3:00, right? You said we could stay until 3:00? 
JIM: We did it. 
JIM: We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together. 
JIM: We do. 
JIM: We don t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there- 
JIM: We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders. 
JIM: we good? 
JIM: We got to see Ping.  And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan.  Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs.  Which for me, has ruined them for life.   
JIM: We gotta get him. 
JIM: We gotta get someone else in there right now. 
JIM: We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign? 
JIM: We have discount prices on ink cartridges... 
JIM: We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that? 
JIM: We have plenty. 
JIM: We just passed the exit for Corcroan. 
JIM: We just wanted to say we are very sorry. 
JIM: We know that. 
JIM: We ll see. You are an assistant who s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message. 
JIM: We ll talk about it later. 
JIM: We ll talk tomorrow? 
JIM: We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It s like everything I did, he just wouldn t go for it. 
JIM: We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends -- 
JIM: We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute. 
JIM: We should go on a double date. 
JIM: We should help him out.   
JIM: We should just go. He's really uncomfortable. 
JIM: We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him. 
JIM: We should switch seats in order to... 
JIM: We still doing the gifts today?  I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party. 
JIM: We tried to find the fairest way to do it. 
JIM: We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes? 
JIM: We were just kids. What did we know? 
JIM: We were robbed last night. 
JIM: We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just -  - all in. Businessman 
JIM: We were. 
JIM: We were... I think she was just trying to- 
JIM: We would really appreciate it. 
JIM: We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's I think she understands... what this is. 
JIM: Weeknights are actually tough just because  
JIM: Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago. 
JIM: Welcome back. 
JIM: Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this? 
JIM: Well done. 
JIM: We'll figure it out. 
JIM: Well guys with girlfriends don't. 
JIM: Well I do. 
JIM: Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And- 
JIM: Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy. 
JIM: Well I think Meredith was just -- 
JIM: Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael. 
JIM: Well I ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn t believe me, so  I needed a little help. 
JIM: Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing? 
JIM: Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else. 
JIM: Well it s not that easy. It s kind of sometimes difficult. 
JIM: Well it s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection. 
JIM: Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires. 
JIM: Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything. 
JIM: We'll look into it. Ryan 
JIM: Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check? 
JIM: Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael. 
JIM: We'll see. I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday. 
JIM: Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael. 
JIM: Well that's great.   You're talking about your court ordered community service? 
JIM: Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside... 
JIM: Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I  don't. Riveting. 
JIM: Well there is some bad news.  There has been another murder. 
JIM: Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed. 
JIM: Well we all want a good party, right? 
JIM: Well we are here now, so let's just-- 
JIM: Well what if we can't do it quickly. 
JIM: Well you gotta figure this out. 
JIM: Well, A for effort right? 
JIM: Well, Andy has a mug just like that. 
JIM: Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people... 
JIM: Well, at least I don't have cavities. 
JIM: Well, by worst, you mean the best. 
JIM: Well, congrats. 
JIM: Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so... 
JIM: Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside. 
JIM: Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight? 
JIM: Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately  three hours ago. 
JIM: Well, he's Florida's problem now. Robert 
JIM: Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight. 
JIM: Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory? 
JIM: Well, I can't be the only one who didn't --   
JIM: Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret. 
JIM: Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards. 
JIM: Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go. 
JIM: Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right? 
JIM: Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause.  
JIM: Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking... 
JIM: Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years. 
JIM: Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You? 
JIM: Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates. 
JIM: Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that. 
JIM: Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table? 
JIM: Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence. 
JIM: Well, I mean he humped Michael. 
JIM: Well, I mean, I don t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so  These things go down all the time. 
JIM: Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight. 
JIM: Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see. 
JIM: Well, I second that emotion. 
JIM: Well, I should hope so.   Who is this? 
JIM: Well, I think she has a kid. 
JIM: Well, I think you handled it pretty well. 
JIM: Well, I think you look great. 
JIM: Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once. 
JIM: Well, I tried.   
JIM: Well, I tried.  You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch. 
JIM: Well, I work here now. 
JIM: Well, if Pam says she won t go, then  we re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph. 
JIM: Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got? 
JIM: Well, I'm evolving, Pam. 
JIM: Well, I'm going the speed limit. So... 
JIM: Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along. 
JIM: Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie. 
JIM: Well, I'm neither of those things, so... 
JIM: Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it. 
JIM: Well, in an ideal world... 
JIM: Well, is that it? Or? 
JIM: Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it. 
JIM: Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect. 
JIM: Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care. 
JIM: Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends. 
JIM: Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert. 
JIM: Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing. 
JIM: Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right? 
JIM: Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world. 
JIM: Well, it's what you wanted. 
JIM: Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here. 
JIM: Well, maybe you should get back to work. 
JIM: Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work. 
JIM: Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute. 
JIM: Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin.. 
JIM: Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now? 
JIM: Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so- 
JIM: Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity. 
JIM: Well, tensions were high in the kitchen. 
JIM: Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so... 
JIM: Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day. 
JIM: Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright? 
JIM: Well, that was quick. 
JIM: Well, that's-- 
JIM: Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady? 
JIM: Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or... 
JIM: Well, the grass is always greener. 
JIM: Well, the group tour is now leaving, then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows. I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to. 
JIM: Well, the joke was on you. 
JIM: Well, then I guess you re ready for this.  
JIM: Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I m waiting. 
JIM: Well, there is no inner...circle. 
JIM: Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ? 
JIM: Well, there's got to be an explanation. 
JIM: Well, this is William M. Buttlicker. 
JIM: Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art. 
JIM: Well, turns out he actually made it up there. 
JIM: Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright.  
JIM: Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but... 
JIM: Well, we re here. Perfect.  
JIM: Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans! 
JIM: Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here. 
JIM: Well, we're really happy. 
JIM: Well, what if I just do this? 
JIM: Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance? 
JIM: Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day. 
JIM: Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness? 
JIM: Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby.  
JIM: Well, you know how I like taking bribes.  
JIM: Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar. 
JIM: Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss. 
JIM: Well, you know you can't actually poison him. 
JIM: Well, you know, the first performance was a little off. But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show. Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee. 
JIM: Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say. 
JIM: Well, you were surprisingly restrained. 
JIM: Well, your office is behind you. 
JIM: Well, you're probably dehydrated. 
JIM: Well, you're pushing the milk out, right? 
JIM: Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm. 
JIM: Well... 
JIM: Well... 
JIM: Well... that's not gonna hold up in court. 
JIM: Well... yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do? 
JIM: We're back in! Right? 
JIM: We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come. 
JIM: We're going to Chuck E. Cheese. 
JIM: Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works. 
JIM: We're going to the hospital, Michael. 
JIM: We're going to Utica? 
JIM: We're gonna get him. 
JIM: We're gonna go get him. 
JIM: We're gonna stay. 
JIM: We've been through this. 
JIM: Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning. 
JIM: Whassup! I still love that after seven years. 
JIM: What a great year for the Dundies. 
JIM: What a horrible, horrible movie that was. 
JIM: What a night. 
JIM: What about a gift basket full of cash? 
JIM: What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right? 
JIM: What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep? 
JIM: What about music? Do you have any music? 
JIM: What about you? 
JIM: What answers? 
JIM: What are the two levels? 
JIM: What are we doing? 
JIM: What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen? 
JIM: What are you doing here? 
JIM: What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or... 
JIM: What are you doing? 
JIM: What are you doing? 
JIM: What are you doing? 
JIM: What are you doing? 
JIM: What are you doing? 
JIM: What are you doing? 
JIM: What are you doing? 
JIM: What are you doing? 
JIM: What are you doing? 
JIM: What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building. 
JIM: What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight! 
JIM: What are you doing? What, stop... 
JIM: What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last! 
JIM: What are you reading? 
JIM: What are you talking about? 
JIM: What are you talking about? 
JIM: What are you talking about? 
JIM: What are you talking about? 
JIM: What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap? 
JIM: What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy? Phyllis, Kevin & 
JIM: What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. 
JIM: What are you watching? 
JIM: What are your top five cases? 
JIM: What brings you to town? 
JIM: What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine? 
JIM: What did he say? 
JIM: What did I do to deserve this? 
JIM: What did I write? 
JIM: What do we got here? 
JIM: What do we got? 
JIM: What do we have here? 
JIM: What do we think, what would drive him crazy. 
JIM: What do we want?! 
JIM: What do you know about boobs? 
JIM: What do you mean? 
JIM: What do you mean? 
JIM: What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing. 
JIM: What do you think of Kelly? 
JIM: What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me? 
JIM: What do you want? 
JIM: What does that mean? 
JIM: What does that mean? 
JIM: What does that mean? 
JIM: What happened to 'Do Not Mock'? 
JIM: What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life. 
JIM: What happened to you? 
JIM: What happened, did he do it? 
JIM: What happened? 
JIM: What happened? 
JIM: What have we got here? 
JIM: What I m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I ve ever said. 
JIM: What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in -- Business 
JIM: What if he jumps out the window and runs away? 
JIM: What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price? 
JIM: What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open? 
JIM: What if we went all the way up to five hundred points? 
JIM: What is going on? 
JIM: What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on? 
JIM: What is happening right now? 
JIM: What is happening? 
JIM: what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.

JIM: What is it? 
JIM: What is it?

JIM: What s that? 
JIM: What s up? 
JIM: What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?! 
JIM: What the heck? Is that, uh...   
JIM: What the hell's a rundown? 
JIM: What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone. 
JIM: What was I gonna- What was I gonna say? 
JIM: What was that? 
JIM: What was that? 
JIM: What was that? 
JIM: What was that? 
JIM: What was this?  
JIM: What was you? You were the leak? 
JIM: What was? 
JIM: What would Bob do? 
JIM: What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working? 
JIM: What!? 
JIM: What, seriously? What is she saying? 
JIM: What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.

JIM: What?  Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that? 
JIM: What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre. 
JIM: What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled. 
JIM: What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting. 
JIM: What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem?  Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh. 
JIM: What? No, no, it's not a vote. 
JIM: What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real! 
JIM: What? No. 
JIM: What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam. 
JIM: What? Pam! 
JIM: What? What am I gonna do? I don t   
JIM: What? What, what, what, what, what? 
JIM: What? What? 
JIM: What? Yeah, right. As if. 
JIM: What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job. 
JIM: What?! 
JIM: What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly? 
JIM: What'd you do, Prison Mike? 
JIM: What'd you do? 
JIM: What'd you get? 
JIM: Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen... You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home! 
JIM: What's gay-dar? Oh, oh, gay-dar, yes! No, uh, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I could check for you. No problem.  It's sold out! Yeah sorry about that, that's a bummer. 
JIM: What's going on? 
JIM: What's going on? 
JIM: What's going on? 
JIM: What's going on? Where's the belsnickel? 
JIM: What's in here? 
JIM: What's that cooler? 
JIM: What's that? 
JIM: What's that? 
JIM: What's that? 
JIM: What's that? 
JIM: What's that? 
JIM: What's that? 
JIM: What's that? 
JIM: What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you. 
JIM: What's that? Robert 
JIM: What's up, buddy? 
JIM: What's up, Meredith? 
JIM: What's up? 
JIM: What's up? 
JIM: What's up? 
JIM: What's what? 
JIM: When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves? 
JIM: When did you go there? 
JIM: When did you need that rundown by? 
JIM: When do we want it?! 
JIM: When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. I just wanted... to go home. This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space. 
JIM: When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes. 
JIM: When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father. 
JIM: When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all? 
JIM: When you work hard, you play hard around here. Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back? 
JIM: When? 
JIM: Where are you going out tonight? 
JIM: Where are you going? 
JIM: Where did you take that? 
JIM: Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand. 
JIM: Where do I want to go? 
JIM: Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um... 
JIM: Where do you want to go for dinner? 
JIM: Where is it? 
JIM: Where we going? 
JIM: Where... did you learn all of this? 
JIM: Where'd I find what? 
JIM: Where'd I put what? 
JIM: Where'd you get that? 
JIM: Which ideally would be me.... 
JIM: Which is you. 
JIM: Which means absolutely nothing. 
JIM: Which one... is she? 
JIM: Which one? 
JIM: Which one's this? Perfect. 
JIM: Which Spice Girl? 
JIM: Which we are. 
JIM: Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number. 
JIM: Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device. 
JIM: Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees. David 
JIM: Which would be me. 
JIM: Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight. 
JIM: Who are you talking to, specifically? 
JIM: Who doesn't love that? 
JIM: Who doesn't? 
JIM: Who else we got? 
JIM: Who goes to business school? 
JIM: Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration? 
JIM: Who here heard it from Ryan? 
JIM: Who is it? 
JIM: Who is this? 
JIM: Who says no moustache?  
JIM: Who wants Phyllis as Santa?  
JIM: Who was driving? 
JIM: Who was that? 
JIM: Who will be watching the children? 
JIM: Who, Stacy? 
JIM: Who, Steve? 
JIM: Who? 
JIM: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.  
JIM: Whoa whoa whoa whoa! 
JIM: Whoa! What was that all about. 
JIM: Whoa, careful, careful. Chili's 
JIM: Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think. 
JIM: Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer? 
JIM: Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face. 
JIM: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this. 
JIM: Whoa, whoa. 
JIM: Whoa. 
JIM: Whoa. 
JIM: Whoa. 
JIM: Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna  Jim & 
JIM: Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine? 
JIM: Whoa. Who is this guy? 
JIM: Whoa. Whoa. Wait. 
JIM: Whoa. You are a volunteer. 
JIM: Whoo! 
JIM: Whoo. 
JIM: Whoops. 
JIM: Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us? 
JIM: Who's gonna see us? 
JIM: Who's that? 
JIM: Who's that? 
JIM: Who's they? Dwight 
JIM: Why are you- How do you know? 
JIM: Why are you telling us this? 
JIM: Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here. 
JIM: Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can't beat that view... right? 
JIM: Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot. 
JIM: Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play? 
JIM: Why don t you start? 
JIM: Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless? 
JIM: Why don't we head in your office to talk? 
JIM: Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again? 
JIM: Why don't we just go by ourselves? 
JIM: Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about? 
JIM: Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here.  Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality. 
JIM: Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting. 
JIM: Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls. 
JIM: Why don't... Let's... 
JIM: Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here... 
JIM: Why is she here? 
JIM: Why is that, why is that weird? 
JIM: Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy. 
JIM: Why not? 
JIM: Why not? 
JIM: Why not? 
JIM: Why won't more people do that?  
JIM: Why would I wanna do that? 
JIM: Why would you do that? 
JIM: Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied. 
JIM: Why would you start so high? 
JIM: Why, what happened? 
JIM: Why? 
JIM: Why? 
JIM: Why? 
JIM: Why? 
JIM: Why? 
JIM: Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back. 
JIM: Why'd you do that? 
JIM: Why's it smell real?  Ah... good one. 
JIM: Will do.  I'll stop calling. 
JIM: Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize. 
JIM: Will they still air 'Rudolph?' 
JIM: Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over? 
JIM: Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay? 
JIM: Wind. 
JIM: Wish us luck! 
JIM: Wish you were home. Uh, anyway... 
JIM: With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number. 
JIM: Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order. 
JIM: Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to? 
JIM: Woah, you guys going to lunch? 
JIM: Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better. 
JIM: Workspace. 
JIM: Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan? 
JIM: Would you hold on one second? That's my other line. 
JIM: Would you like to be our fourth? 
JIM: Would you like to pull a prank on Andy? 
JIM: Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game. 
JIM: Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions... 
JIM: Would... 
JIM: Wow That's terrible, I really liked him. 
JIM: Wow! Congratulations, that s a really big step. 
JIM: Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised? 
JIM: Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so...  
JIM: Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority. 
JIM: Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away! 
JIM: Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow. 
JIM: Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so... 
JIM: Wow! That sounds incredible. . Oh, guys. Limo s here. Let s do this. Change if you need to. 
JIM: Wow! There it is. 
JIM: Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day. 
JIM: Wow, can we make it a different moment? 
JIM: Wow, hey. 
JIM: Wow, I'm really sorry. 
JIM: Wow, simultaneous sale. 
JIM: Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good. 
JIM: Wow, that is  wow. 
JIM: Wow, that is delicious. 
JIM: Wow, that s  
JIM: Wow, that sounds pretty cool. 
JIM: Wow, that's a lot of keys. 
JIM: Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us. 
JIM: Wow, that's great, because I need paper. 
JIM: Wow, that's not such a bad idea. 
JIM: Wow, that's not what I meant. 
JIM: Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal? 
JIM: Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good. 
JIM: Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you. 
JIM: Wow, this is my lucky day. 
JIM: Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man. 
JIM: Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers. 
JIM: Wow, what are we talking about? 
JIM: Wow, what do you put our chances at? 
JIM: Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley. 
JIM: Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow. 
JIM: Wow.  
JIM: Wow.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar. 
JIM: Wow. Alright. Can t wait to meet her. 
JIM: Wow. Are you that bored? 
JIM: Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... . 
JIM: Wow. Businessman 
JIM: Wow. Busy morning. 
JIM: Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is... 
JIM: Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that? 
JIM: Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor. 
JIM: Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends. 
JIM: Wow. I think you're bluffing. 
JIM: Wow. I thought you were good at Flash. 
JIM: Wow. It s the end of an era. 
JIM: Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter. 
JIM: Wow. Oh! 
JIM: Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel? 
JIM: Wow. Psychopath.  
JIM: Wow. Ryan 
JIM: Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something. 
JIM: Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'. 
JIM: Wow. Um, ok.  
JIM: Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship? 
JIM: Wow. What have we got here? 
JIM: Wow. What kind of bike is that? 
JIM: Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible. Robert 
JIM: Wow. Win-Win. 
JIM: Wow. You look-- 
JIM: Wrong, for so many reasons. 
JIM: Yeah 
JIM: Yeah  Not that they're not smart people. 
JIM: Yeah I couldn't cut it down. 
JIM: Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  Ok, see you next week. Bye.  Again? 
JIM: Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other. 
JIM: Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it. 
JIM: Yeah sorry everyone else didn t come. I think they re just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery. 
JIM: Yeah sure. You want to look at it first? 
JIM: Yeah that's great. Great. 
JIM: Yeah that's true. 
JIM: Yeah! 
JIM: Yeah! 
JIM: Yeah! 
JIM: Yeah! 
JIM: Yeah!  Guten Prank number two. 
JIM: Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine. 
JIM: Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right? 
JIM: Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You re clean, right? 
JIM: Yeah, alright Kev why don t you come with us? 
JIM: Yeah, bigger actually. 
JIM: Yeah, but I don't smoke. 
JIM: Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that. 
JIM: Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people. 
JIM: Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors? 
JIM: Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it.  You know what, just come here. 
JIM: Yeah, gotta eat somewhere. 
JIM: Yeah, he's definitely something. 
JIM: Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you. 
JIM: Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one. 
JIM: Yeah, I am too. 
JIM: Yeah, I am. Wait, how do you know that? I didn't tell you that. 
JIM: Yeah, I can't... really can't move him. 
JIM: Yeah, I did.   
JIM: Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam. 
JIM: Yeah, I do. C'mon.  
JIM: Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so. 
JIM: Yeah, I gotta call out on that. 
JIM: Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right. 
JIM: Yeah, I guess. 
JIM: Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it. 
JIM: Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day. 
JIM: Yeah, I know I should. 
JIM: Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep. 
JIM: Yeah, I know. 
JIM: Yeah, I know. 
JIM: Yeah, I m here. Are we all on? Business 
JIM: Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check. 
JIM: Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out. 
JIM: Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you. 
JIM: Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice. 
JIM: Yeah, I think so. 
JIM: Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen. 
JIM: Yeah, I thought you started it. 
JIM: Yeah, I want to go home. 
JIM: Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met... 
JIM: Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM. 
JIM: Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie! 
JIM: Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person. 
JIM: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone. 
JIM: Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine. 
JIM: Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now. 
JIM: Yeah, it does, actually. 
JIM: Yeah, it's a golf text. 
JIM: Yeah, it's all right. 
JIM: Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that.  Cool?  
JIM: Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work. 
JIM: Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great. 
JIM: Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie.   
JIM: Yeah, me neither. 
JIM: Yeah, no, I don't think you can. 
JIM: Yeah, okay. 
JIM: Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that. 
JIM: Yeah, people like me I guess. 
JIM: Yeah, right. 
JIM: Yeah, right. I mean, unless they re willing to pass some tests. 
JIM: Yeah, she does like Elmo. 
JIM: Yeah, she's doing really well. 
JIM: Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back. 
JIM: Yeah, sold about forty thousand. 
JIM: Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous. 
JIM: Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff? 
JIM: Yeah, that was nuts. 
JIM: Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right. 
JIM: Yeah, that's pretty good. 
JIM: Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises. 
JIM: Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry. 
JIM: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone. 
JIM: Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight? 
JIM: Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies. 
JIM: Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input  
JIM: Yeah, totally you did. 
JIM: Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one. 
JIM: Yeah, trying to quit though. 
JIM: Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please. 
JIM: Yeah, uh, well. 
JIM: Yeah, we all really... 
JIM: Yeah, we did. Hey, how long how long do we think that s gonna take? 
JIM: Yeah, we'd never do that. 
JIM: Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag. 
JIM: Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give. 
JIM: Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck! 
JIM: Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting. 
JIM: Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you. 
JIM: Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO. 
JIM: Yeah, what do you think that's about? 
JIM: Yeah, who'd have thought?  
JIM: Yeah, why did you? 
JIM: Yeah, woah.  Yep, absolutely, go ahead. 
JIM: Yeah, yeah. 
JIM: Yeah, yeah. 
JIM: Yeah, yeah. 
JIM: Yeah, yeah. Exactly. 
JIM: Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate? 
JIM: Yeah, yeah. Totally. 
JIM: Yeah, you can. 
JIM: Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated.   Totally kidding.   I'm gonna need four.   
JIM: Yeah, you don't have to, ummm. Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all. 
JIM: Yeah, you don't? 
JIM: Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna... 
JIM: Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but... 
JIM: Yeah, you never know. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah.

JIM: Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day. 
JIM: Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just... 
JIM: Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist? 
JIM: Yeah. At least for one more dance. 
JIM: Yeah. Big sale. Don t worry about it though, I don t really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though  Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much.  
JIM: Yeah. Bye Pam. 
JIM: Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that. 
JIM: Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out? 
JIM: Yeah. Even you. 
JIM: Yeah. Good to be back. 
JIM: Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon.   Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it? 
JIM: Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something? 
JIM: Yeah. I have a question for you. 
JIM: Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this? 
JIM: Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station? 
JIM: Yeah. I like talking to her too. 
JIM: Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is... 
JIM: Yeah. I'm definitely going. 
JIM: Yeah. It s real. It s the only way you ll learn. OK, and go ahead.  Oh, god, nice! She s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful! 
JIM: Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before. 
JIM: Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone. 
JIM: Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though. 
JIM: Yeah. Maybe we should both go. 
JIM: Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don t worry. I ll figure it out. 
JIM: Yeah. No. Good. 
JIM: Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely. 
JIM: Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager. 
JIM: Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay? 
JIM: Yeah. Okay, maybe. 
JIM: Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit. 
JIM: Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement. 
JIM: Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant. 
JIM: Yeah. Right? 
JIM: Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis. 
JIM: Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway. 
JIM: Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later? 
JIM: Yeah. Super pretty. 
JIM: Yeah. Sure. 
JIM: Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... .  Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?

JIM: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. 
JIM: Yeah. That does not feel good. 
JIM: Yeah. Totally. 
JIM: Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem.  Thank you. 
JIM: Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart. 
JIM: Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out. 
JIM: Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did. 
JIM: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous. 
JIM: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. Yeah. It s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to... 
JIM: Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will.  
JIM: Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen. 
JIM: Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.

JIM: Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read.

JIM: Yep. Wait, and this.  
JIM: Yep. You're being replaced. 
JIM: Yep... 
JIM: Yes--

JIM: Yes it is. 
JIM: Yes!  
JIM: Yes! Angela! Please... 
JIM: Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen? 
JIM: Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder... 
JIM: Yes! Phyllis!  Phyllis, just put your foot right through here . Right through the flonk. 
JIM: Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah. 
JIM: Yes! So when do you start? 
JIM: Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement? 
JIM: Yes! We do.  Eclairs. 
JIM: Yes, absolutely. 
JIM: Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet. 
JIM: Yes, beautiful girl in the front. 
JIM: Yes, but not by kidnapping. 
JIM: Yes, car seat's right there. 
JIM: Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing?  One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it. 
JIM: Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay. 
JIM: Yes, he is finally nigh. 
JIM: Yes, I agree. 
JIM: Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam. 
JIM: Yes, I can.  uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just  we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care. 
JIM: Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going. 
JIM: Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so... 
JIM: Yes, I m happy. 
JIM: Yes, I... Do you want to... 
JIM: Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay? 
JIM: Yes, it is. 
JIM: Yes, let's have a word. 
JIM: Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three. 
JIM: Yes, nice. Good word association 
JIM: Yes, okay. Bye. 
JIM: Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow. 
JIM: Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly. 
JIM: Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second... 
JIM: Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens. 
JIM: Yes, you do. 
JIM: Yes, you should. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. 
JIM: Yes. All right. Great.  
JIM: Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories. 
JIM: Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen. 
JIM: Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face. 
JIM: Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet. 
JIM: Yes. It is. 
JIM: Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her. 
JIM: Yes. Right now? Yes. 
JIM: Yes. They totally do. 
JIM: Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later? 
JIM: Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story. 
JIM: Yes. Yeah. 
JIM: Yes. You don't love Holly. 
JIM: Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up. 
JIM: Yes? 
JIM: Yes? 
JIM: Yes? 
JIM: Yesss. And you're Abby, right? 
JIM: Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe. 
JIM: Yikes. 
JIM: Yikes. 
JIM: Yikes. 
JIM: Yikes. 
JIM: Yikes. 
JIM: Yikes. 
JIM: Yikes.  
JIM: You a sports fan? 
JIM: You all right? 
JIM: You all right? 
JIM: You all right? 
JIM: You all right?  
JIM: You all right? What s going on? 
JIM: You all right? You ok? 
JIM: You alright, Santa? 
JIM: You are bleeding through your shirt. 
JIM: You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you. 
JIM: You are not going to believe this. 
JIM: You are not my superior. 
JIM: You are really good at modesty. She s a genius. She painted this incredible mural in the kids  room. There s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children  
JIM: You are? 
JIM: You are? 
JIM: You are?   A cat? 
JIM: You bet. 
JIM: You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill? 
JIM: You buy a purse. 
JIM: You called any headhunters? 
JIM: You can try. That, that might work. 
JIM: You can write a book about chairs. 
JIM: You cannot take the fall for him. 
JIM: You can't do this. 
JIM: You can't even do that. 
JIM: You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers. 
JIM: You can't lay down. 
JIM: You can't say, or you can't pronounce it? 
JIM: You can't yell out "I need this, I need this" as you pin down an employee on your lap! 
JIM: You come so prepared. Aspirin. 
JIM: You coming down? 
JIM: You could just be saying it to get the job. 
JIM: You could ve just called that an alliance too, right? 
JIM: You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room? 
JIM: You couldn't of memorized that? 
JIM: You cut more than you had to, didn't you? 
JIM: You define foment. 
JIM: You did approve it? 
JIM: You did do it? 
JIM: You did not force me to do this. 
JIM: You did not have sex with Pam's mom. 
JIM: You did not know it. 
JIM: You didn t force me. 
JIM: You didn't hear my pros. Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday. 
JIM: You do? 
JIM: You do? 
JIM: You do? 
JIM: You doing alright, man? 
JIM: You don't even drink tea. 
JIM: You don't have to lie. 
JIM: You don't know what it is. 
JIM: You don't know. 
JIM: You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight? 
JIM: You feel good? 
JIM: You follow him on Twitter? 
JIM: You gonna answer it? 
JIM: You gonna wish me luck? 
JIM: You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so... 
JIM: You got it, you're so close! 
JIM: You got it. 
JIM: You got it. 
JIM: You got it. 
JIM: You got it. 
JIM: You got it.  
JIM: You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started? 
JIM: You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote. 
JIM: You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always? 
JIM: You gotta be kidding me. 
JIM: You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping? 
JIM: You gotta have sex with a woman. 
JIM: You gotta play along man. 
JIM: You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it. 
JIM: You have a cell phone charger. 
JIM: You have a toothbrush. 
JIM: You have a walking buddy. 
JIM: You have no idea. 
JIM: You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly. 
JIM: You have to make the decision. 
JIM: You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam? 
JIM: You haven't done any of the research. 
JIM: You haven't heard our theme, though. 
JIM: You heard that one. 
JIM: You hired him? 
JIM: You just came up with that. 
JIM: You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment.  
JIM: You just had a rebound. 
JIM: You knew it the whole time, buddy. 
JIM: You knew it. 
JIM: You knew it. 
JIM: You know a ton of fourteen year old girls? 
JIM: You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go. 
JIM: You know her name. 
JIM: You know he's doing all this on purpose. 
JIM: You know I have to do this. 
JIM: You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out. 
JIM: You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for? Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales. 
JIM: You know I majored in Public Speaking in College. 
JIM: You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this! 
JIM: You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good. Woman on 
JIM: You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up. 
JIM: You know that s  
JIM: You know this isn't real TV, right? 
JIM: You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch. 
JIM: You know what it s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right? 
JIM: You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events. 
JIM: You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly... 
JIM: You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them. 
JIM: You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy. 
JIM: You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party? 
JIM: You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine. 
JIM: You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks. 
JIM: You know what? 
JIM: You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide? 
JIM: You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't. 
JIM: You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers. 
JIM: You know what? I could use a little help. 
JIM: You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right? 
JIM: You know what? I think you just need to meet him. 
JIM: You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up. 
JIM: You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow. 
JIM: You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that. Mr. 
JIM: You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here. 
JIM: You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours. 
JIM: You know what? Let me take Roy. 
JIM: You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital. 
JIM: You know what? Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place. Happy thoughts, Pam. Happy thoughts. 
JIM: You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling. 
JIM: You know what? Maybe they just ate. 
JIM: You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight. 
JIM: You know what? Maybe we should talk. 
JIM: You know what? That's private. 
JIM: You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while. 
JIM: You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got. 
JIM: You know what? Yeah. Have at it. 
JIM: You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun. 
JIM: You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway. 
JIM: You know what's crazy? 
JIM: You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye. 
JIM: You know, at the end of the day, it s really only two days. I mean, I ll be back in the office. If you need me for an emergency, call me. I ll be there... 
JIM: You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad. 
JIM: You know, can I call you back? Andy and 
JIM: You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing none of these people are good enough. 
JIM: You know, I just think you should know that- 
JIM: You know, it was one day. 
JIM: You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet. 
JIM: You know, it's weird. It's practically a shot for shot remake. 
JIM: You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less. 
JIM: You know, man, it's really you're call. 
JIM: You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit. 
JIM: You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen. 
JIM: You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent. 
JIM: You know, truth be told, I think all you ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I m gone. 
JIM: You know, try sending them another invoice. 
JIM: You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key. 
JIM: You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey. 
JIM: You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know. 
JIM: You like it? 
JIM: You look a little worried. 
JIM: You look cute today, Dwight. 
JIM: You look great. 
JIM: You look great. 
JIM: You look really pretty. 
JIM: You making this up as you go along, aren't you? 
JIM: You mean Kevin? 
JIM: You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also?  Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen. 
JIM: You mean on a weekend? 
JIM: You mean today? He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot. Billy 
JIM: You mean your thoughts and feelings? 
JIM: You must be out or something. 
JIM: You must be really proud. 
JIM: You need to let him go. 
JIM: You need to stop talking. 
JIM: You ok? 
JIM: You okay, man? 
JIM: You okay? 
JIM: You okay? 
JIM: You paid for it? 
JIM: You pet the animals and they pet you back. 
JIM: You play?  
JIM: You playing that game again? 
JIM: You re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy s gonna record it. So we ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam? 
JIM: You re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh  David 
JIM: You re not serious, are you? You didn t get any of the recital? 
JIM: You re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You ve agreed to this. 
JIM: You re the best. 
JIM: You re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie. 
JIM: You re welcome. 
JIM: You ready? 
JIM: You ready? 
JIM: You realize you're not actually talking to me, right? 
JIM: You really don't have his phone number? 
JIM: You really think you can make it up to me with food? 
JIM: You really wanna bet? 
JIM: You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day? 
JIM: You really want to do this? 
JIM: You see that? I'm pretty sure she's... Hi.  
JIM: You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race. 
JIM: You set the bar so high. 
JIM: You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit. 
JIM: You should ask him. It s a color you would never expect.  Too easy. 
JIM: You should probably just meander back there; take a look. See if he's, see if he's back. 
JIM: You should stop this,  and you should call Dwight right now. 
JIM: You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace. 
JIM: You still do that thing? 
JIM: You sure? 
JIM: You sure? 
JIM: You sure? 
JIM: You sure? 
JIM: You threw the summoning bag at me, sir? 
JIM: You took the deal. 
JIM: You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I m here. 
JIM: You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand. 
JIM: You up for a game? 
JIM: You used my move, didn't you? 
JIM: You wanna do this? 
JIM: You wanna pull a prank on Andy? 
JIM: You want a birthday pie? 
JIM: You want music? 
JIM: You want to just make a run for it? 
JIM: You want to talk about it? 
JIM: You watched it. 
JIM: You watching that commercial again?  Why do you keep watching it, if you know it s just gonna make you cry? 
JIM: You were right. 
JIM: You were right. 
JIM: You weren t there. 
JIM: You what? 
JIM: You will never want to leave your room. 
JIM: You will? Wanna do it right now? 
JIM: You wouldn't dare. 
JIM: You wouldn't tell your mom? 
JIM: You writing your name over there? 
JIM: You, too. 
JIM: You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years. 
JIM: You... owe me. 
JIM: You'd actually move to Scranton? 
JIM: You'd slow me down. 
JIM: You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage. 
JIM: Your agenda-taking pleases him. 
JIM: Your department's just you, right? 
JIM: Your ex-wife? 
JIM: Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything. 
JIM: Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity. 
JIM: Your mom. 
JIM: You're a psychopath. 
JIM: You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and- 
JIM: You're breathing very heavily. 
JIM: You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go. 
JIM: You're definitely hoarding this by the way. 
JIM: You're gonna have to talk louder. 
JIM: You're good... you're good at sales. 
JIM: You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine. 
JIM: You're messing with me. 
JIM: You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office. 
JIM: You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again. 
JIM: You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin. 
JIM: You're not going to freak out? 
JIM: You're not having sex. 
JIM: You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager. 
JIM: You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right? 
JIM: You're not the manager even in your own fantasy? 
JIM: You're not, nope. Nope. 
JIM: You're only engaged once. Well present company excluded, but. 
JIM: You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic. 
JIM: You're starting your own paper company? 
JIM: You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania? 
JIM: You're welcome. 
JIM: You're welcome. 
JIM: You've been gone for a long time. 
JIM: You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3! 
JIM: You've got something on your nose. 
JIM: You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point. 
JIM: You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them. 
JIM: You've seen it, right? 
JIM: Yup, coming.  All right. 
JIM: Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that. 
JIM: Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock. 
JIM: Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right? 
JIM: Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact. 
JIM: Yup. 
JIM: Yup. 
JIM: Yup. 
JIM: Yup. 
JIM: Yup. 
JIM: Yup. 
JIM: Yup.  Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left. 
JIM: Yup. I'll trade. 
JIM: Yup. Really great. When's she available? 
JIM: Yup. That's exactly what we did. 
JIM: Yup. That's perfect. 
JIM: Yup... 
JIM9334: The rest stop where that soda exploded on me. Exit 17, I think. 1 o'clock. 
JIM9334: Yeah. C'mon we'll meet halfway. You'll be back for your 4 o'clock class. 
JO:  DeAngelo! We're in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain't got no host! 
JO:  Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this.  
JO:  Hello. 
JO:  I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here? 
JO:  I thought this guy was the manager? 
JO:  Is that a lump of coal? 
JO:  It's a little form, says "I did not do it." 
JO:  Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion! 
JO:  Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don't ride 'em. Lotta people try to ride 'em. 
JO: "The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, "You're Too Fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat." The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. "I love you, you Gay Bastard," I said. "You Gay Bastard," I s--. "Gay Ba--" "Gay B--"" 
JO: : Now listen here, Gabe, you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat. I made some changes to my book. See if you like them. 
JO: All right then. 
JO: All right. 
JO: All that for this job. 
JO: All that's just birthday information, Michael. 
JO: And that's your unbiased opinion. 
JO: And we didn't find anything on your computer. 
JO: Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea? 
JO: Anything else I can help you with? 
JO: Anything I can do for you Puddin'? 
JO: Aw, thank you. I've been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat? 
JO: Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid. 
JO: Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it. 
JO: Better. 
JO: But you wouldn't need more trucks? 
JO: Can you now? 
JO: 'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing. 
JO: Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what? 
JO: 'Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here. 
JO: Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room? 
JO: Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel? 
JO: Each of you is doing half a job. 
JO: Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who's giving me the silent treatment... Speak to me... speak.  Come with me. 
JO: Enough! 
JO: Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted. 
JO: Except this.  
JO: Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it. 
JO: Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now. 
JO: Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you. 
JO: Get everybody sick in the office. 
JO: Good-looking group. 
JO: Hahahahahaha. 
JO: Have I been that naughty? 
JO: Hello? 
JO: Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning? 
JO: He's in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi!  
JO: Hey there. 
JO: Hey! 
JO: Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers. 
JO: Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there. 
JO: Hmm. 
JO: Honey, you don't seem like your normal self. 
JO: How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work? 
JO: How'd my girl Nellie do? 
JO: Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. 
JO: Huh? 
JO: I am so proud of Sabre's "Print In All Colors" initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply.  Daryl? 
JO: I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy. 
JO: I hope your rough patch ends soon. 
JO: I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid? 
JO: I like that. 
JO: I look forward to that too. 
JO: I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job. 
JO: I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager. 
JO: I think that's it. So we're all good!  Thanks ya'll. 
JO: I think you  will become the salesman, and congratulations!  You're gonna be the new manager of this branch! 
JO: I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question.  If he isn't here in sixty seconds... 
JO: I would take until the end of the day if I were you.   
JO: I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie. 
JO: If it doesn't matter, then tell me. 
JO: If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities. 
JO: I'll interview you right now. 
JO: I'm Jolene Bennett, Jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, and now I have my own pilot's license. I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you. 
JO: I'm not sure you do, teddy bear. 
JO: I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands? 
JO: Integrity move. I like it. 
JO: It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place. 
JO: I've always been a fighter. And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard-- 
JO: Let me see what I can do.
JO: Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what? 
JO: Let's just talk. 
JO: Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won't fire the boy. 
JO: Luckily I have someone for you! 
JO: Mama Jo knew there was something up. 
JO: Michael Scott... what do you know? 
JO: Michael. 
JO: Michael. 
JO: Michael? 
JO: Michael? 
JO: No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement. 
JO: No, send him in.  Who is this? 
JO: No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set. 
JO: Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please. 
JO: Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm's reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we're gonna take that arm, and we're gonna start selling printers. 
JO: Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager. 
JO: Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like. 
JO: Now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay bastard. Chapter One. I was born, not into luxary, nor poverty.  But into adversity, and for that, I thank the Lord. My Father was a man. That's all we can know. After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Stree and down Azalea Lane. Which would later become my-- 
JO: Oh good morning sweetheart. 
JO: Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket? 
JO: Oh honey, surely you don't want that. 
JO: Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay? 
JO: Oh look at you. 
JO: Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can't have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week. 
JO: Oh no no no! Are you feeling ill? 
JO: Oh! You're sick!  Dangit! That's exactly why I sent that receptionist home. 
JO: Oh, God. How far has it gone? 
JO: Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you. 
JO: Oh, I hate that. 
JO: Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling! 
JO: Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat! 
JO: Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius. 
JO: Oh, that's Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the "Mrs." just to piss off the new wife. Well, let's take a gander around this place. 
JO: Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off.  You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both! 
JO: Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though.  Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company? 
JO: Okay Dwight. 
JO: Okay hush now. 
JO: Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited? 
JO: Okay. 
JO: Okay. 
JO: Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while! 
JO: Or what? You gonna shoot me? 
JO: Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carrying nothing but my Sable gloves. I've had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry. 
JO: Paper material? 
JO: Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson's snowball company, so you'll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things. 
JO: Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office? 
JO: Really? 
JO: She didn't mention it? 
JO: Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you? 
JO: Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down. 
JO: So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you? 
JO: So listen, why don't you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you can't handle the changes. 
JO: So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him? 
JO: Sorry Sugar. What'd you want? 
JO: Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was. 
JO: Thank you. 
JO: Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist. 
JO: That's f***ing crazy.  Get outta here.  What a nutjob. 
JO: That's right, darlin', now you're the proud new owner of a Sabre handbook and my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces, I mean, what's going on now? I mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin? Right? I mean, Sabre? What's that? Some company I've never heard of? Down in Tallahassee? Where is that? Near Mars? 
JO: The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder. 
JO: They love a good crotch. 
JO: They're the easiest-to-use printers on the market. 
JO: This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim? 
JO: Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office? 
JO: Turn me around. Now.  Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said? 
JO: Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn't quite as racy, but uh... let's give it a go. 
JO: Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that! 
JO: Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay. 
JO: Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you?  I want to see who it is. Turn me around. 
JO: Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys. 
JO: We don't need any heroes here honey. It's time for you to get on home now. 
JO: Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix.  Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming! 
JO: Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home. 
JO: Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers. 
JO: Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time. 
JO: Well, anytime now. 
JO: Well, buy property. That's my advice. 
JO: Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life. 
JO: Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? Cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can't come in my house. 
JO: Well, I guess we're all right, Michael. 
JO: Well, I think you're both being a little too modest. 
JO: Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay. 
JO: Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work... 
JO: Well, I'm gonna let this marinate. So you can go. 
JO: Well, I'm inclined to believe you. 
JO: Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy. 
JO: Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic.  
JO: Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something. 
JO: What?! 
JO: When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me. 
JO: When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she'd ask one 
JO: Which are? 
JO: Who else would be responsible? 
JO: Who is it? 
JO: Who's Holly? 
JO: Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him? 
JO: Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho, what'cha say? 
JO: Why is this my problem, Michael? 
JO: Yeah, but see... it's not. 
JO: Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay? 
JO: Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money? 
JO: Yeah, I want to hear more from you. 
JO: Yeah. 
JO: Yeah. I think I understand. 
JO: Yeah. Take Jim's old office. 
JO: Yes it is. 
JO: Yes, well okay. Florida ain't that far away. 
JO: Yes? 
JO: You can go on. Shoo! 
JO: You know it doesn't have to be an invention. 
JO: You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I'm gonna defer to your judgment. 
JO: You should take that as a compliment! 
JO: You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty? 
JO: You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management? 
JO: You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on. 
JOAN: Erin  
JOAN: I have a question for Erin. 
JOAN: So my question is, um, do  don t you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her. 
JOAN: Um Oh, Erin.. 
JOAN: Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother. 
JONES: Alright, what do you want? 
JONES: Let's just meet back in an hour. 
JONES: OK. 
JONES: You have about ten seconds--- 
JORDAN:  Okay. 
JORDAN: Do you need anything? 
JORDAN: Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with. 
JORDAN: Hello. 
JORDAN: I don't, I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry. 
JORDAN: I'm good. 
JORDAN: No, Anthropology. We don't have this in that size, pretty lame. 
JORDAN: Seriously? 
JORDAN: Well, I umm - 
JORDAN: Who is our biggest client? 
JORDAN: Why are you telling me this? 
JORDAN: Yeah. 
JORDAN: Yeah. 
JOSH:  
JOSH:  
JOSH:  Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute? 
JOSH: A shot of MIDORI, perhaps. 
JOSH: All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front. 
JOSH: All right. 
JOSH: All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner. 
JOSH: And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford. 
JOSH: And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time. 
JOSH: Andy, it's not--- 
JOSH: As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples. 
JOSH: Did you? 
JOSH: Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job. 
JOSH: Fine! All right. 
JOSH: Hey Andy! 
JOSH: Hey, Michael. 
JOSH: I don't think so. 
JOSH: I honestly don't. I don't know. 
JOSH: I just want to say thanks. Good luck. 
JOSH: I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done. 
JOSH: Jan, hey. 
JOSH: Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow. 
JOSH: JIM! 
JOSH: Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman. 
JOSH: Michael Scott.  
JOSH: Nice to meet you. 
JOSH: Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations. 
JOSH: Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure? 
JOSH: Okay. 
JOSH: Or what? We didn't bet anything, Michael. 
JOSH: Pretty good. 
JOSH: She is our boss. 
JOSH: SNIPE-- 
JOSH: So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets. 
JOSH: So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber. Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them. 
JOSH: Sure, what's up? 
JOSH: Thank you, everyone. 
JOSH: Thank you. 
JOSH: They're exclusive with Staples. 
JOSH: This is not working, ok? We are getting slaughtered out there. 
JOSH: Uh... we'll do it later. 
JOSH: Um, we should... 
JOSH: We gotta go. 
JOSH: We just need a strategy, ok? We're going to set up a trap in the gun room. All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44? 
JOSH: We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan. 
JOSH: Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now. 
JOSH: What about you, Craig, you lose anyone? 
JOSH: What's going on with Fairfield County schools? Karen, did you generate that price list? 
JOSH: Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely. 
JOSH: Yeah, let's change the subject. 
JOSH: Yeah, stop by later. 
JOSH: Yeah, we should go. 
JOSH: Yes now. 
JOSH: Yes. 
JOSH: You don't snipe in Carrington, ok? 
JOSH: You hooked up with Jan? 
JOSH: You know Dan Gore from Buffalo. 
JOSH: You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it. 
JR.: Hey bro! It was here all along.  
JR.: Oh god, thank goodness you're here. I was having a little trouble with this door. Yesterday. I um, I think it was yesterday. 
JR.: Way! 
JR.: Yeah, uh, I just, I figured I'd get that first relapse out of the way. God, what's happened to our family? Everything is so messed up! How did you even know I was in here? 
JR:  May the good lord be with you down every road you roam. And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home. And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true. And do unto others as you'd have done to you... 
JR: Bye Tuna, bye Pam! 
JR: Dad, no. I'm just having a good time getting to know Andy's friends here. 
JR: Hey Bronard! 
JR: I wouldn't have missed it. 
JR: I'm Walter, Andy's younger brother. 
JR: Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam . 
JULIA:   Okay. 
JULIA:   Whoa. What the hell? 
JULIA: Actually, I, I don't have a boyfriend. 
JULIA: I can't accept these prices, Stanley. They just cut our budget. 
JULIA: I just got out of a relationship too. It's really hard. 
JULIA: No, I, I don't think so. 
JULIA: No, it could go straight to our business address. 
JULIA: Oh, no, it's okay. This is my car. 
JULIA: Oh, this is a nice office. 
JULIA: Thank you. 
JULIA: Thanks for walking me out. 
JULIA: What's a "Nard-Dog"? 
JULIA: You must be freezing. 
JULIE:  I should hope not. 
JULIE: Are you thinking that I said 'ESP?' 
JULIE: Good. Hi. 
JULIE: I am an ESL teacher. 
JULIE: I think I'm gonna go. 
JULIE: I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done. 
JULIE: So you work with Pam and Jim? 
JULIE: What are you doing? 
JULIE: What's he usually like? 
JULIE: Yeah. 
JULIE: Yeah. 
JULIE: Yeah. 
JULIUS: And it went like this.  
JULIUS: Great, great, great. 
JULIUS: Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us? 
JULIUS: It's your wife? You better take it. 
JULIUS: No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think? 
JULIUS: Okay.  Wow, Halpert's got game. 
JULIUS: Stanley Hudson. 
JULIUS: That's it. 
JULIUS: Well, do you think you can sink one from deep? 
JULIUS: Yeah, you show me how. 
JULIUS: You're Kareem, coming to help. 
JUSTIN: And I'm, I'm gonna go now. 
JUSTIN: Cool. 
JUSTIN: Hi. 
JUSTIN: Hi. 
JUSTIN: Hi. 
JUSTIN: Polznik. 
JUSTIN: Sorry for wasting your time. 
JUSTIN: You didn't want me before. That's what you said. 
JUSTIN: You were kind of a jerk to me. 
JUSTINE:  I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here. 
JUSTINE: Can we . go some place private? 
JUSTINE: Hello. I m looking for Darryl Philbin? 
JUSTINE: Ok .? 
JUSTINE: Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas.

KAREN:  Dammit. 
KAREN:  Do you still have feelings for her? 
KAREN:  Dwight, you won the raffle!  
KAREN:  Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every... 
KAREN:  Hello? 
KAREN:  Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview. 
KAREN:  Hey. 
KAREN:  I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy. 
KAREN:  Karen Filippelli. 
KAREN:  Look how cute he is! He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade. 
KAREN:  Oh my God! You ass!   
KAREN:  Oh my God. Can you believe that? 
KAREN:  Oh. Okay. 
KAREN:  Six? 
KAREN:  This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. 
KAREN:  This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. 
KAREN:  Where'd you find them? 
KAREN:  Yeah. 
KAREN: ...Almost done? 
KAREN: ...and we're gonna go to dinner. 
KAREN: ...to knit. 
KAREN: A Christmas drinking game ... 
KAREN: A toaster. 
KAREN: Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time. 
KAREN: Ah, of course. 
KAREN: All right, you guys. See you later, wish us luck! 
KAREN: And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt. 
KAREN: And it didn't end well. 
KAREN: And now we get to remember it forever. 
KAREN: And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five. 
KAREN: And then we're gonna go to the movies. 
KAREN: Andy, no acappella. 
KAREN: Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties. 
KAREN: Answer it. 
KAREN: Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough.  What? 
KAREN: As well. 
KAREN: Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth! Ben 
KAREN: Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration. 
KAREN: But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority. 
KAREN: But Jim, this garlic bread is cold. 
KAREN: But now we think you're a liar. 
KAREN: Bye. Ok, so this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up. 
KAREN: Can I please see you in my office, please? 
KAREN: Can we just get back to work? 
KAREN: 'Cause I'm going to get the job. 
KAREN: 'Cause of Jan again? 
KAREN: C'mon, Jim! 
KAREN: Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter? 
KAREN: Did you ever have a thing for Pam? 
KAREN: Do it. 
KAREN: Do you have a girlfriend? Ben 
KAREN: Do you like it? 
KAREN: Do you want to get back together with her? 
KAREN: Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..? 
KAREN: Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration? 
KAREN: Don't! She's nuts!  
KAREN: Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting. 
KAREN: Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo? 
KAREN: Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby?  
KAREN: Exactly. But you get it, right? Can't stay there. 
KAREN: Fifty-one. 
KAREN: For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing. 
KAREN: Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that. 
KAREN: Get 'em big boy! 
KAREN: Good luck, Halpert. 
KAREN: Good. 
KAREN: Goodnight, guys. 
KAREN: Got it. 
KAREN: He would be disaster. 
KAREN: Heh. 
KAREN: Hello? Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well. 
KAREN: He's a very nice man. And he's very well suited for the job he has now. 
KAREN: He's cute. You should date him. 
KAREN: Hey dummy, get in the car! 
KAREN: Hey I got one. 
KAREN: Hey Jan. 
KAREN: Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted. 
KAREN: Hey um, I wanted to talk to you. I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys. 
KAREN: Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out?  "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute." This is ridiculous. 
KAREN: Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall? 
KAREN: Hey, do you want to grab a coffee? 
KAREN: Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp. 
KAREN: Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet? 
KAREN: Hey, so what's the status. 
KAREN: Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow? 
KAREN: Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is...  
KAREN: Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit. 
KAREN: Hey. 
KAREN: Hey. 
KAREN: Hey. 
KAREN: Hey. 
KAREN: Hey. 
KAREN: Hey. Hi, guys. 
KAREN: Hi. 
KAREN: His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky. 
KAREN: Hmm... I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip. 
KAREN: Hole? 
KAREN: How are we going to get home? 
KAREN: How often do you come here? 
KAREN: I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want. 
KAREN: I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch. Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else. 
KAREN: I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good. 
KAREN: I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out. 
KAREN: I feel great, Kevin. Thank you. 
KAREN: I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever. 
KAREN: I know! 
KAREN: I love it. I want in. Who's the target? 
KAREN: I moved here from Connecticut... 
KAREN: I so got you. 
KAREN: I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a "for rent" sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away. 
KAREN: I think I owe you one. 
KAREN: I think that's a really good option... 
KAREN: I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim. 
KAREN: I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume. 
KAREN: If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult. 
KAREN: I'm- 
KAREN: I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal. 
KAREN: I'm good. Thanks. 
KAREN: I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him. 
KAREN: I'm saying that you're being sexist. 
KAREN: I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around. 
KAREN: I'm taking Stanley. 
KAREN: I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management. 
KAREN: It's a pretty common one. 
KAREN: It's a strategy! 
KAREN: It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells. 
KAREN: It's not good. Andy and 
KAREN: It's okay, we all say things without thinking. 
KAREN: Jesus. 
KAREN: Jim, hang on a second? 
KAREN: Jim? 
KAREN: Jim's nice enough. I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  What is that? 
KAREN: Just call me when you're done. 
KAREN: Just tap S then D. 
KAREN: Karen Fillipelli. Jim's girlfriend. 
KAREN: Karen. I love your sweater. 
KAREN: 'Kay. 
KAREN: Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted? 
KAREN: Let's go get a broom. 
KAREN: Let's just get this over with, shall we? 
KAREN: Listen, I- 
KAREN: Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard. So think about it, okay? Okay, bye. 
KAREN: Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay? 
KAREN: Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect. 
KAREN: Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't. 
KAREN: Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes. 
KAREN: Lots of it!  
KAREN: Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks. 
KAREN: Michael... 
KAREN: Mm. 
KAREN: Mm-hm. 
KAREN: Mr. Franklin? Ben 
KAREN: Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home. 
KAREN: My chair is squeaking. 
KAREN: Nice basket. 
KAREN: No that's, that is incredibly dangerous. 
KAREN: No way.  
KAREN: No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me. 
KAREN: No. 
KAREN: Nope. 
KAREN: Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about? 
KAREN: Of course not! 
KAREN: Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first. 
KAREN: Oh cool, yeah. 
KAREN: Oh my God! 
KAREN: Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink. 
KAREN: Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun. 
KAREN: Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic. 
KAREN: Oh, come on, guys. Please. Andy and 
KAREN: Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three. 
KAREN: Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you.   
KAREN: Oh, thank you. 
KAREN: Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that? 
KAREN: Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you. 
KAREN: Oh, uh, thanks. 
KAREN: Oh, what happened? 
KAREN: Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky. 
KAREN: Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine.  
KAREN: Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house. 
KAREN: Oh, you know. Never... .never mind. 
KAREN: Oh, you're kidding me? 
KAREN: Oh. 
KAREN: Oh. Did you shake it? 
KAREN: Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ... 
KAREN: OK, OK. Um, cons. 
KAREN: OK, remember, be strong. 
KAREN: Ok. 
KAREN: OK. Andy and 
KAREN: Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me. 
KAREN: Okay, good! Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch. And, I was gonna meet them, so... 
KAREN: Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now? 
KAREN: Okay, yeah. Maybe I will. 
KAREN: Okay. 
KAREN: Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over. 
KAREN: Ooh. 
KAREN: Oooh. Good-bye Michael. 
KAREN: Open it! Open it ! Open it!  
KAREN: Pam is... kind of a bitch. 
KAREN: Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment. 
KAREN: Phyllis. What do you think? Too much? 
KAREN: Rachel, your house is beautiful. 
KAREN: Really? 
KAREN: Really? 
KAREN: Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable. 
KAREN: Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn... 
KAREN: Right on.  Hey is that Josh's computer? 
KAREN: Right. 
KAREN: Scared? 
KAREN: Shouldn't we be equals? 
KAREN: So do you want to see it or not? 
KAREN: So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use? 
KAREN: So um, well good. 
KAREN: So we have all night. Where do you want to go first? 
KAREN: So what's going to happen to us when I get this job? 
KAREN: So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh? 
KAREN: So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim? 
KAREN: So, let me ask you a question. 
KAREN: So, that's... my basic 5 year plan. And after that, who knows? 
KAREN: stop. 
KAREN: Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay? 
KAREN: Thank you. 
KAREN: Thank you. 
KAREN: Thank you.  Second 
KAREN: Thank you. It just all happened so fast. 
KAREN: Thanks Ro. Hey, we finally connected. How's Scranton? 
KAREN: Thanks. 
KAREN: Thanks. 
KAREN: Thanks. 
KAREN: Thanks.  
KAREN: Thanks. That was fun. 
KAREN: That - it's the same thing. 
KAREN: That is not healthy behavior. 
KAREN: That wasn't him.  
KAREN: That would be fine. 
KAREN: That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date. 
KAREN: That's it? That's what you came up with? 
KAREN: That's nice. 
KAREN: That's rude. 
KAREN: That's so great. That's great. 
KAREN: This is going to be an adventure. 
KAREN: This is not a proportionate response. 
KAREN: This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please. 
KAREN: Toby's not a salesperson. 
KAREN: Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm. 
KAREN: Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian? 
KAREN: Uh, in about a month. 
KAREN: Uh, it's very insulting. 
KAREN: Uh, no, we're good. Thanks. 
KAREN: Uh, nothing. They're just out of Herr's chips. 
KAREN: Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... . 
KAREN: Uh, what are you doing here? 
KAREN: Uh, what's that smell? 
KAREN: Um, shoot. Uh, I will. Sorry. 
KAREN: Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry. 
KAREN: Umm, two hundred and one dollars. 
KAREN: Wait, "Amazing Race" like, the biggest sale wins? 
KAREN: Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving? 
KAREN: Well that you kissed. And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal. It's just a kiss. Wait- you're not still interested in him? 
KAREN: Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas. 
KAREN: Well, if you get the job then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid. I was at the beach. We won't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there. 
KAREN: Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated. 
KAREN: Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared. 
KAREN: What are the ingredients of poi? 
KAREN: What are you doing here? 
KAREN: What are you sorry about? 
KAREN: What are you sorry about? 
KAREN: What glare? 
KAREN: What happened on your sales call? 
KAREN: What is going on? 
KAREN: What you gonna do? 
KAREN: What you're saying is extremely misogynistic. 
KAREN: What! 
KAREN: What? 
KAREN: What's your funding? 
KAREN: When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more. 
KAREN: When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so... 
KAREN: Who are you faxing so early in the morning? 
KAREN: Who's Bob Vance? 
KAREN: Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon? 
KAREN: Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later? 
KAREN: Wow! 
KAREN: Wow. That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction. 
KAREN: Yeah! You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend. 
KAREN: Yeah, all day. 
KAREN: Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously. 
KAREN: Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that? 
KAREN: Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would. 
KAREN: Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go. 
KAREN: Yeah, nothing there. 
KAREN: Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go. 
KAREN: Yeah, thank you. 
KAREN: Yeah, thanks. 
KAREN: Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment. 
KAREN: Yeah, we do a raffle... 
KAREN: Yeah, you can't. 
KAREN: Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that. 
KAREN: Yeah, you should not encourage him. 
KAREN: Yeah. 
KAREN: Yeah. 
KAREN: Yeah. 
KAREN: Yeah. 
KAREN: Yeah. P and R? 
KAREN: Yeah? 
KAREN: Yep. 
KAREN: Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me. 
KAREN: Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car. 
KAREN: Yes. uh, huh. 
KAREN: You called me. 
KAREN: You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow. 
KAREN: You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team. 
KAREN: You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job. 
KAREN: You sure? 
KAREN: You took my chair. 
KAREN: You're kidding. 
KAREN: Yup. 
KATHY:  All expenses paid. Yeah, Jim's gonna be there. Their marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me. Definitely we will. It's three weeks in Tallahassee, what else is there to do? 
KATHY:  Oh,has she been fussing long? 
KATHY: Hi. 
KATHY: I was out like a light... Oh, she's not hungry... 
KATHY: Kathy. 
KATHY: What's the water like? 
KATY:  
KATY:  Come back... 
KATY:  Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! 
KATY:  Sorry. 
KATY:  They are soo cute. 
KATY: Alright! You want to drive? 
KATY: Alright. 
KATY: At five? 
KATY: Bishop O'Hara. 
KATY: Both.  
KATY: Bring it on. 
KATY: Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone. 
KATY: Cool. 
KATY: Cool. What year were you there? 
KATY: Do you think that'll ever be us? 
KATY: Good. 
KATY: Good. Here. Squeeze it inside. 
KATY: Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you. 
KATY: Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um... 
KATY: Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions. 
KATY: Hi 
KATY: Hi! 
KATY: Hi. 
KATY: How are you? 
KATY: I can't. 
KATY: I don't think so I'm really busy. 
KATY: I guess a cup of coffee would be great. 
KATY: I really can't. 
KATY: I should probably get back to my table. 
KATY: I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that. 
KATY: I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook. 
KATY: I wouldn't think of it. 
KATY: I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off? 
KATY: I'm good. It's good to see you. 
KATY: I'm hungry. 
KATY: I'm Katy. 
KATY: Is that from Starbucks? 
KATY: It's a... it's a very nice car. 
KATY: Katy. 
KATY: No really it is. 
KATY: No, I don't believe that. 
KATY: No. 
KATY: No. I really don't want to inconvenience you. 
KATY: No... 
KATY: Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality. 
KATY: Oh no, it's um... 
KATY: Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers. 
KATY: Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me. 
KATY: Oh, thank you. 
KATY: Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay. 
KATY: Okay, um, first, Legally Blond. 
KATY: Okay, um... 
KATY: Okay. 
KATY: Okay. 
KATY: Okay. 
KATY: Okay.  
KATY: Okay. Cool. 
KATY: Pam, were you a cheerleader? 
KATY: Regular coffee is fine. 
KATY: So do you like the periwinkle and the purples? 
KATY: Thank you. 
KATY: Thanks. 
KATY: That was on Sesame Street. 
KATY: That's hilarious. 
KATY: This one is hand embroidered. 
KATY: This one's really good for a hot date. 
KATY: Um, for the... the desert island. 
KATY: What colors do you like? 
KATY: What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight? 
KATY: What? 
KATY: Whoa. What? Captain 
KATY: Why? 
KATY: Wow, thanks. 
KATY: Wow. Is that for the office? 
KATY: Yeah. 
KATY: Yes, I did!  A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E! 
KATY: You got that? 
KATY: You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right? 
KATY: You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet? 
KATY: You sit out there, don't you? 
KELLY: 
KELLY:  
KELLY:  
KELLY:  
KELLY:   
KELLY:   
KELLY:   
KELLY:   I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing. 
KELLY:   Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress. 
KELLY:   No. Not going to happen. He has hurt me too much and too often. And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed. 
KELLY:   Thank you. 
KELLY:   What are we doing? This is so wrong. 
KELLY:   Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween. 
KELLY:  "My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant." See I did the voice. 
KELLY:  ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you. 
KELLY:  Absolutely! 
KELLY:  Am I not a serious candidate? 
KELLY:  And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore. 
KELLY:  Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right? 
KELLY:  Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones... 
KELLY:  But it's so weird to fall asleep. And I just hate it. 'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30. 
KELLY:  Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this. 
KELLY:  Come on! 
KELLY:  Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or... 
KELLY:  Eww! 
KELLY:  Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! 
KELLY:  Guys, what if this is our last day at work? What if we never see each other ever again?  
KELLY:  He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term... 
KELLY:  Hey guys, sorry I'm late. 
KELLY:  Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun. 
KELLY:  I don t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan. Toby:Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it 
KELLY:  I just don't want to get hit by it... 
KELLY:  I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend. 
KELLY:  I love it! 
KELLY:  I love you too. 
KELLY:  I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know... 
KELLY:  I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit... 
KELLY:  I'm so happy for you... 
KELLY:  Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon. 
KELLY:  Jim.... Jim!  
KELLY:  Me too! 
KELLY:  me! 
KELLY:  Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again. 
KELLY:  Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as "Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way." 
KELLY:  No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people! 
KELLY:  No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall. 
KELLY:  Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you? 
KELLY:  Oh my God. 
KELLY:  Oh, is... Ryan coming back today? 
KELLY:  Oh, long-term, definitely. Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay? Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything. I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows? 
KELLY:  Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things. 
KELLY:  Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch? 
KELLY:  Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question. Do you think that I should get a Fedora? 
KELLY:  Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill. 
KELLY:  This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing. 
KELLY:  Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy? 
KELLY:  Very smart. 
KELLY:  Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed. 
KELLY:  Weird. 
KELLY:  Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong? 
KELLY:  What song was it? 
KELLY:  What?! 
KELLY:  Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan... 
KELLY:  What's going on? 
KELLY:  Whoa. 
KELLY:  Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree? 
KELLY:  Why? 
KELLY:  Yeah, that's what I thought. 
KELLY:  Yikes. 
KELLY:  You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me. 
KELLY:  Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball. 
KELLY:  You're adorable. You need to go for it.  I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't - 
KELLY:  You're so cool. 
KELLY: "Big mistake! Huge!" 
KELLY: "Spicy Curry", what's that mean? 
KELLY: ...and you call me, to calm you down... 
KELLY: ...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure. 
KELLY: ...that I thought you should know ... 
KELLY: ...what else do people like? 
KELLY: ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not. 
KELLY: 1, 2, 3! 
KELLY: 1... 2... 3 
KELLY: A lot. Black guys mostly. 
KELLY: A vacation. 
KELLY: AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT! 
KELLY: Ahhh! What's going on?!?! 
KELLY: Ahhh!!  
KELLY: Ahhhhh!  I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan!  This is the best day of my whole l ife! 
KELLY: Alan's cartoon is so funny, right? 
KELLY: All the time. 
KELLY: And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like "No!" 
KELLY: And cups of coffee. 
KELLY: And guess what buddy,  I am keeping it. 
KELLY: And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said... Ryan and 
KELLY: And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like "Ryan, what's taking you so long?" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say. 
KELLY: And that is what you call a meet cute. 
KELLY: And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct? 
KELLY: And that, is how it's done. 
KELLY: And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said "Is it okay if I sip it?" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way. 
KELLY: And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time. 
KELLY: And this is way worse than the stroller she came with. 
KELLY: And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible. 
KELLY: And who is on my side?  
KELLY: And you're sorry. 
KELLY: And... 
KELLY: Andy Bernard?? 
KELLY: Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic. 
KELLY: Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg. 
KELLY: Andy, pick up the phone! 
KELLY: Andy, that was just the ice. 
KELLY: Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam. 
KELLY: Are we just gonna wait here?  
KELLY: Are you accusing me of something? 
KELLY: Are you all right? This must be so awful for you. 
KELLY: Are you kidding me? 
KELLY: Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam. 
KELLY: Are you moving back here? 
KELLY: Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body. 
KELLY: Ask where he's from. 
KELLY: Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys. 
KELLY: Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome. 
KELLY: Aww.   
KELLY: Because I never forget anything. 
KELLY: Because they acted all tough and everything... 
KELLY: Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy. 
KELLY: Blankets, what am I, five? 
KELLY: Blow my brains out. 
KELLY: Boring. 
KELLY: But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married? 
KELLY: But I--it's not right. 
KELLY: But parody is always derivative. 
KELLY: But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend. 
KELLY: But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to... 
KELLY: But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, "Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin." 
KELLY: But you're an accountant too. 
KELLY: Bye, Andy.  
KELLY: Bye.  
KELLY: Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco. 
KELLY: Cake. 
KELLY: Call your mom, Michael.   
KELLY: Can I be your bridesmaid? 
KELLY: Can I have a turkey burger? 
KELLY: Can we just take those first two things? 
KELLY: Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is? 
KELLY: Can we speak privately about our relationship? 
KELLY: Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael? 
KELLY: Can't do what? 
KELLY: 'Cause it's next to they baby section, okay? 
KELLY: Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture? 
KELLY: Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where? 
KELLY: Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out?  
KELLY: Come on Scott, please? It's me. Professor 
KELLY: Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews. 
KELLY: Cool. 
KELLY: Cool. 
KELLY: Cool. 
KELLY: Cool. Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos. 
KELLY: Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues? 
KELLY: Could you scoot over? You're on my dress. 
KELLY: Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties? 
KELLY: Damn girl! Your body! 
KELLY: Damn it. 
KELLY: Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that? 
KELLY: Decorating. 
KELLY: Definitely, definitely, Jim. 
KELLY: Depends... how much have you eaten already today? 
KELLY: Did Michael get them for you? 
KELLY: Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself. 
KELLY: Do they still get paid? 
KELLY: Do what? I just asked you a question. 
KELLY: Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby? 
KELLY: Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand? 
KELLY: Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business? Professor 
KELLY: Don't be scared! You're good! You're good! 
KELLY: Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology. 
KELLY: Don't even listen to them. They're so... 
KELLY: Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family! 
KELLY: Don't use your cute baby to make us like you. 
KELLY: Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire--- 
KELLY: Drake is your baby s name? 
KELLY: Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly. 
KELLY: Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head. 
KELLY: Dwight! 
KELLY: Dwight, get out of my nook! 
KELLY: Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition. 
KELLY: Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida? 
KELLY: Enjoy the snow losers. 
KELLY: Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore. 
KELLY: Everybody hates those endings! 
KELLY: Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement. 
KELLY: Eww, what is that? 
KELLY: Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word? 
KELLY: Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds. 
KELLY: Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! 
KELLY: Fine. 
KELLY: Finn. 
KELLY: Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means "Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. 
KELLY: Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me... 
KELLY: For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them. 
KELLY: For you maybe. 
KELLY: For you. I'm with Darryl. 
KELLY: Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place? 
KELLY: Gay ear? Are you 12 years old? 
KELLY: God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake. 
KELLY: God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies! 
KELLY: God I don't even remember what that fight was about. 
KELLY: God, how many number nines did you order? 
KELLY: God, I hate you so much!  
KELLY: Good luck Michael! 
KELLY: Good. 
KELLY: Good. And the dry cleaners? 
KELLY: Good. Let s go. 
KELLY: Guess whose boyfriend it is? 
KELLY: Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue. 
KELLY: Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here. 
KELLY: Have a seat, I'll write it down. 
KELLY: Have we met before? 
KELLY: Hell yeah. 
KELLY: Hello. 
KELLY: Here you go. 
KELLY: Here's the deal. I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time. That came out wrong. It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim. 
KELLY: He's not saying anything! 
KELLY: He's rubbing his neck. 
KELLY: He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, "Kelly, that will be the color of our children." 
KELLY: Hey! Is that his scarf? 
KELLY: Hey, guys. 
KELLY: Hey, Ryan! 
KELLY: Hey. 
KELLY: Hi David!  
KELLY: Hi everyone, I'm Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel. 
KELLY: Hi, Michael. 
KELLY: Hi. 
KELLY: Hi-yah! 
KELLY: How about you Pam? 
KELLY: How can someone so beautiful be so sad? 
KELLY: How is this a pizza party? 
KELLY: How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic? 
KELLY: I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight. 
KELLY: I am so cold. 
KELLY: I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you! 
KELLY: I can t get down. 
KELLY: I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed. 
KELLY: I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, "Hi Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison." 
KELLY: I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be? 
KELLY: I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel? 
KELLY: I can't believe you're back together with Roy! 
KELLY: I can't think of any CEO's, any race. 
KELLY: I could be the Indian Julia Roberts. 
KELLY: I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys. 
KELLY: I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing. Professor 
KELLY: I didn't do anything! 
KELLY: I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking. 
KELLY: I didn't see you. And you were there all along.  Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go. 
KELLY: I do find that offensive, actually. 
KELLY: I do, I do. This isn't right. 
KELLY: I do. 
KELLY: I don t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn t look so good. 
KELLY: I don't care. They can just vote. 
KELLY: I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at! Kelly's 
KELLY: I don't get the reason for this party. 
KELLY: I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends. 
KELLY: I don't have any, assh***. 
KELLY: I don't know how I'm going to live here without you. 
KELLY: I don't know if she was white. 
KELLY: I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever. 
KELLY: I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel. 
KELLY: I don't know. 
KELLY: I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby? 
KELLY: I don't know. Dwight's so weird. 
KELLY: I don't know. I mean, it's well-written and all, I just--- 
KELLY: I don't know. It looks pretty great to me. 
KELLY: I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now. 
KELLY: I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, 
KELLY: I don't think I should be married to you anymore. 
KELLY: I don't understand what the big deal is. 
KELLY: I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us? 
KELLY: I don't want to hit the big rock! 
KELLY: I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office. 
KELLY: I eat beef. 
KELLY: I feel weird. 
KELLY: I get that. I get that. 
KELLY: I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual. 
KELLY: I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs. 
KELLY: I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again. 
KELLY: I guess people have fewer choices as they get older. 
KELLY: I guess. 
KELLY: I hate dieting, I hate it so much. I hate this worm inside of me! 
KELLY: I hate it. 
KELLY: I have a computer question. Hey Oscar? 
KELLY: I have a customer meeting. 
KELLY: I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael. 
KELLY: I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet. 
KELLY: I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat. 
KELLY: I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug? 
KELLY: I invited him. 
KELLY: I just had the longest meeting. 
KELLY: I just told you. 
KELLY: I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be. 
KELLY: I know but there was an emergency. 
KELLY: I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it. 
KELLY: I know, obsessed with me much? 
KELLY: I know, right? Probably a lot. 
KELLY: I know. 
KELLY: I look really good in white. 
KELLY: I love it. 
KELLY: I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C. Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible. 
KELLY: I love your tie, Michael. 
KELLY: I mean that's a baseball term, right? 
KELLY: I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan  for him to know that we have a date tonight? 
KELLY: I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?! 
KELLY: I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs. 
KELLY: I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So... 
KELLY: I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that? 
KELLY: I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's. 
KELLY: I said to Ryan, "I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'" 
KELLY: I said, "I wonder." I didn't say, "I think." 
KELLY: I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico. 
KELLY: I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out. 
KELLY: I thin we're gonna need to here those texts. 
KELLY: I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill. 
KELLY: I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you. 
KELLY: I think I'm gonna stay here. 
KELLY: I think something a little fishy is going on.  
KELLY: I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake. 
KELLY: I thought they were kind of cute. 
KELLY: I thought you read these every week. 
KELLY: I took the tags off already. 
KELLY: I try not to think about it. 
KELLY: I want an SUV... with three rows of seats. 
KELLY: I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring - 
KELLY: I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want. 
KELLY: I was a twelve year old bully. 
KELLY: I was kickin' it. 
KELLY: I was lying. 
KELLY: I was on an IV for two days at the hospital. 
KELLY: I was raped. 
KELLY: I wasn't going to interrupt. 
KELLY: I will steal the iPod. 
KELLY: I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white. 
KELLY: I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't... 
KELLY: I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you. 
KELLY: I... 
KELLY: Ice Cream. 
KELLY: If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one. 
KELLY: If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me. 
KELLY: If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself. 
KELLY: If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody? 
KELLY: If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now. 
KELLY: If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself. 
KELLY: If you take it back, I'll scream. 
KELLY: I'll give you a 
KELLY: I'll never forget everything that you've done for me. 
KELLY: I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan. 
KELLY: I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up. 
KELLY: I'm dying! 
KELLY: I'm going to have some cake. 
KELLY: I'm gonna write something mean on his wall. 
KELLY: I'm not single. I have a man.  
KELLY: I'm okay! 
KELLY: I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now. 
KELLY: I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper? There's gotta be something else we can talk about. 
KELLY: I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be! 
KELLY: I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer. 
KELLY: I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money. I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just can't do it. Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss. Okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years. 
KELLY: I'm throwing out all my mirrors. 
KELLY: I'm too excited to sleep. 
KELLY: Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch. 
KELLY: In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it. 
KELLY: Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King? 
KELLY: Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky. 
KELLY: Is Brad okay? 
KELLY: Is Ryan going? 
KELLY: Is that a blow torch?! 
KELLY: Is that supposed to impress me?   
KELLY: Is the nail place Koreans or whites? 
KELLY: Isn't that like your third soda today? 
KELLY: It has almost no calories. 
KELLY: It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot. 
KELLY: It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. "The Business Bitch", "The Diet Bitch", "The Shopping Bitch", "The Etiquette Bitch." 
KELLY: It was you. 
KELLY: It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve. 
KELLY: It's a small office. 
KELLY: It's about a family. A real-life family. 
KELLY: It's basic discovery. We have the right to review it. 
KELLY: It's Eric and Megan. 
KELLY: It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together. 
KELLY: It's just some of us are taking this really seriously. 
KELLY: It's no bother, you guys are our friends. 
KELLY: It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal. 
KELLY: It's not a dress. It's a kurta. 
KELLY: It's present time, you guys.  Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre. 
KELLY: It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her. 
KELLY: It's so sexy. You look so hot. 
KELLY: It's true! 
KELLY: Jessica, did you just fart?  
KELLY: Jim! 
KELLY: Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam? 
KELLY: Josh Duhamel. 
KELLY: Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam. 
KELLY: Just leave me alone! 
KELLY: Just put it in your pocket. Michael and 
KELLY: Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is so hot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. ...Maybe he did it. 
KELLY: Lame! What else you got, Andy? 
KELLY: Lame? You worked at Anthropology? 
KELLY: Let go of me! 
KELLY: Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that. 
KELLY: Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat? 
KELLY: Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair? 
KELLY: Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.  
KELLY: Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here. 
KELLY: Look, I'm gonna count to 3. 
KELLY: Looks like salmon. 
KELLY: Lulu from The Fifth Element. 
KELLY: Me, too Oscar. 
KELLY: Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant! 
KELLY: Michael get to the good part. 
KELLY: Michael, how do I create a new tab? 
KELLY: Michael, it's time. 
KELLY: Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me. 
KELLY: Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right? 
KELLY: Mmhmm. 
KELLY: Mmhmm. 
KELLY: Mm-hmm. 
KELLY: Mmm hmm. 
KELLY: Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale!   Mmmm... 
KELLY: Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again. 
KELLY: Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed? 
KELLY: Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind, uh, reading the date on that please?  
KELLY: Mr. Scott? 
KELLY: My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl. 
KELLY: My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday! 
KELLY: My god, he's like a black George Clooney. 
KELLY: My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight. 
KELLY: My resolution was to get more attention. 
KELLY: Namaste. 
KELLY: Never marrying. 
KELLY: Never thought of myself as an executive before. 
KELLY: No problem. 
KELLY: No! 
KELLY: No! 
KELLY: No!  How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?! 
KELLY: No, he's a freak. 
KELLY: No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically. Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding. 
KELLY: No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now. 
KELLY: No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar. 
KELLY: No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank!   
KELLY: No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere. 
KELLY: No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel. 
KELLY: No. 
KELLY: No. I'm gonna count to 3. 
KELLY: No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.  
KELLY: Nope. 
KELLY: Not so much anymore. 
KELLY: Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome. 
KELLY: Nothing's going on. 
KELLY: Now he's never gonna come. 
KELLY: Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there. 
KELLY: O.  
KELLY: Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof... 
KELLY: Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me. 
KELLY: Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick. 
KELLY: Oh God.  
KELLY: Oh it was? 
KELLY: Oh my God I love it.  
KELLY: Oh my God what song was that? 
KELLY: Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing? 
KELLY: Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid? 
KELLY: Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama! 
KELLY: Oh my God, he is so cute! Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me? 
KELLY: Oh my God, I'm so worried. 
KELLY: Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed. 
KELLY: Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... .  
KELLY: Oh my God, kill me! 
KELLY: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God... 
KELLY: Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior. 
KELLY: Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela? 
KELLY: Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic. This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale. 
KELLY: Oh my God, what is wrong with you? 
KELLY: Oh my God, when is it? 
KELLY: Oh my God. He's going to kill us. 
KELLY: Oh my God. You're so in love now. 
KELLY: Oh that is so sweet. Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so... 
KELLY: Oh yeah? Screw you too. 
KELLY: Oh! 
KELLY: Oh! He says it's cool.   He said, "It's cool". 
KELLY: Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you! 
KELLY: Oh! You scared me! 
KELLY: Oh, art show! 
KELLY: Oh, baby. 
KELLY: Oh, can I come? 
KELLY: Oh, from the insurance commercials! 
KELLY: Oh, God, please stop! 
KELLY: Oh, god. 
KELLY: Oh, good, that was from me. 
KELLY: Oh, great. 
KELLY: Oh, hello Ryan. You look well. 
KELLY: Oh, hey, I love your earrings. 
KELLY: Oh, hi!  
KELLY: Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City. 
KELLY: Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer? 
KELLY: Oh, like Amanda Bynes. 
KELLY: Oh, me too. 
KELLY: Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news! You must feel so sad. 
KELLY: Oh, my god! 
KELLY: Oh, my God. You scared me. 
KELLY: Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and he had skin cancer too. 
KELLY: Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine! 
KELLY: Oh, please Jim? Please, please, Jim. Please, please, please? He's so cute. I like him so much. And I would do it, but I'm too shy. Please, Jim, please, please, please, please, Jim. Please, please, please... 
KELLY: Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me. 
KELLY: Oh, so I'm crazy now? 
KELLY: Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe. 
KELLY: Oh, that is so good. 
KELLY: Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me. 
KELLY: Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share. 
KELLY: Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think. 
KELLY: Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt. 
KELLY: Oh. 
KELLY: Oh. 
KELLY: Oh. 
KELLY: Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway. 
KELLY: OK Mr. Scott, it's, it's admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you. 
KELLY: OK, all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends. 
KELLY: OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say "Customer Service, this is Kelly!" Except don't say "Kelly," say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones,  and I talked like this for the whole conversation! 
KELLY: OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing sooo good. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing? 
KELLY: OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry. 
KELLY: Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good... 
KELLY: OK, That's cool. I completely understand. 
KELLY: OK. 
KELLY: OK. Bring it on. 
KELLY: OK. Volley for serve, P.  
KELLY: Okay, bye honey. 
KELLY: Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan?  
KELLY: Okay, I see how it is.  Oops. 
KELLY: Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim?  'Cause we missed it! 
KELLY: Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night... 
KELLY: Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories. 
KELLY: Okay.  
KELLY: Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo? 
KELLY: Okay? 
KELLY: On it. 
KELLY: Only three tickets. 
KELLY: Ooooh! 
KELLY: Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you. 
KELLY: Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced.  
KELLY: Pam. She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work. 
KELLY: Pam? 
KELLY: Pitiful. 
KELLY: Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone. Professor 
KELLY: Punch him, Toby! 
KELLY: Rachel. 
KELLY: Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me. 
KELLY: Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go. 
KELLY: Really? 
KELLY: Right, so? 
KELLY: Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys. 
KELLY: Ryan used me an object. 
KELLY: Ryan, I changed my mind. 
KELLY: Ryan, we're doing the dance! 
KELLY: Ryan. 
KELLY: Ryan? 
KELLY: Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, "Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do." 
KELLY: Screw you guys. You're dead to me. 
KELLY: Screw you man. People like my stuff. 
KELLY: Screw you. 
KELLY: Second opinion on what? 
KELLY: See, I told you. You want one Meredith? 
KELLY: See? I wasn't lying. 
KELLY: She could be. 
KELLY: She looks awful. 
KELLY: She's from "What a Girl Wants." 
KELLY: She's such a special person. And she's turning 50 this year. 
KELLY: Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about? 
KELLY: Should I seduce him? 
KELLY: Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!!  Shut it down! Shut it down! 
KELLY: Six. 
KELLY: So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100. 
KELLY: So I said, "Ryan, what took you so long?" And I just said that to him, can you believe that? 
KELLY: So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend. 
KELLY: So that is why I have to leave at 
KELLY: So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress!  One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything.  I mean not everything, Jim.  I promise, I'm not that kind of... 
KELLY: So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, number three becomes number two, etc, etc. And let's just say that I just sent back Love Actually, which was awesome.  And they sent me Uptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see love actually again,  but it's at the bottom of the que! Oh no, what do I do!?  What I do, is this. I go online, I go click, click, click. And I change the order of the que, so that I can see Love Actually  as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works?  
KELLY: So then this means nothing to you.  
KELLY: So unnecessary. 
KELLY: So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag? 
KELLY: So where's the ring? 
KELLY: So you should be heading back to your desk. 
KELLY: So you're dumping me? 
KELLY: So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day. 
KELLY: So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.   Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too. 
KELLY: So, I was looking so hot... 
KELLY: So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar --  How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.  
KELLY: So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could... 
KELLY: Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer. 
KELLY: Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for. 
KELLY: Sometimes my bangs cover it. 
KELLY: Sparkles... 
KELLY: Stop squirming. 
KELLY: Stop telling me how to spend my tickets. 
KELLY: Stop yelling at me! 
KELLY: Sure thing, Mr. Howard. 
KELLY: Take that! Not so pre-violent anymore! 
KELLY: Team U.S.A.! 
KELLY: Thank you so much for saying that. I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate. 
KELLY: Thank you, Dwight. 
KELLY: Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds. 
KELLY: Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know. 
KELLY: Thank you. 
KELLY: Thank you.  
KELLY: Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine? 
KELLY: Thanks, Michael. 
KELLY: Thanks. 
KELLY: That idea sucks. 
KELLY: That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself. 
KELLY: That is an amazing name. I m obsessed with Drake. His last album  it just touched me to pieces. 
KELLY: That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet. 
KELLY: That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you. 
KELLY: That is the bravest thing I have ever heard. 
KELLY: That s a tablecloth. 
KELLY: That was really cool.  
KELLY: That'll work. 
KELLY: That's all he wrote. 
KELLY: That's Buddhist. 
KELLY: That's like my dream job. How did you even get that job? 
KELLY: That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen. 
KELLY: That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday. 
KELLY: That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti--  
KELLY: That's not that bad actually. 
KELLY: The last thing that we want is any kind of drama. 
KELLY: The people person's paper people. 
KELLY: The people person's paper people. 
KELLY: The people person's paper people. 
KELLY: The people person's paper people. 
KELLY: The people person's paper people. 
KELLY: The show's back on, what happened? 
KELLY: There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing? 
KELLY: There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant. 
KELLY: They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny. 
KELLY: Think you can handle this? 
KELLY: This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. This day is bananas! B-A-N-A- 
KELLY: This doesn't look good. 
KELLY: This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic. 
KELLY: This is a bowler- 
KELLY: This is a fast food receipt from April. 
KELLY: This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston. 
KELLY: This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's? 
KELLY: This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver. 
KELLY: This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin. 
KELLY: This point system is really insulting. 
KELLY: This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, "Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?" And I'd be like, "blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah," giving you the exact right answer. 
KELLY: Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme.   
KELLY: To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn. 
KELLY: Try "Jesus." 
KELLY: Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister. 
KELLY: Ugh, no that thing is dead. 
KELLY: Ugh, so jealous of your boobs. 
KELLY: Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl. 
KELLY: Uh,... can it be in private?  Don't worry, it's not about you.  As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho. 
KELLY: Uh... excuse me. I want to get a... Kelly's 
KELLY: Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar. 
KELLY: Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination. 
KELLY: Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now. 
KELLY: Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives. 
KELLY: Um, so you're in the tub with everything? 
KELLY: Um, we're cool.   Bye. 
KELLY: Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um... 
KELLY: Umm, see you later tonight. 
KELLY: Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right. 
KELLY: Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor. 
KELLY: Waaay too tight. 
KELLY: Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you. 
KELLY: Wait, Michael? 
KELLY: Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance.  
KELLY: Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating? 
KELLY: Wait, what are you saying? I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you. 
KELLY: Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton. 
KELLY: We have a date! 
KELLY: We re running off into the sunset. 
KELLY: We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot. 
KELLY: Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies. 
KELLY: Well help me, OK? Just, uh take... 
KELLY: Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Do you guys think she was hot? 
KELLY: Well that blows. 
KELLY: Well then, what's the one true rumor? 
KELLY: Well why don't you invite your friends? 
KELLY: Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it! 
KELLY: Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store. 
KELLY: Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right? 
KELLY: Well, his heart was in the right place. 
KELLY: Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you. 
KELLY: Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant. 
KELLY: Well, I just need to know where this is going. 
KELLY: Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way. 
KELLY: Well, I think I have that persona. 
KELLY: Well, I think I'd look really hot in one. Where'd you get your fedora? 
KELLY: Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power. 
KELLY: Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy. 
KELLY: Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly! 
KELLY: Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right. 
KELLY: Well, Toby and I did, yeah. 
KELLY: Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam. 
KELLY: Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me. 
KELLY: Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids? 
KELLY: Well... this was supposed to be your wedding. 
KELLY: We're back together again baby. 
KELLY: We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk. 
KELLY: We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed. 
KELLY: We're having the best conversation.  
KELLY: We're screwed. 
KELLY: Wha what's Dwight's mothers name. 
KELLY: What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal? 
KELLY: What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat. 
KELLY: What are you referencing? 
KELLY: What are you talking about? 
KELLY: What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman? 
KELLY: What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all. 
KELLY: What did I say? 
KELLY: What did yours say? 
KELLY: What do you mean you have plans tonight? 
KELLY: What drama? 
KELLY: What d'ya think?  
KELLY: What emails are you talking about? 
KELLY: What happened? Is there a ring? 
KELLY: What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong? 
KELLY: What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher? 
KELLY: What keeps your glasses on? 
KELLY: What psycho would send that as a gift?  
KELLY: What the hell is a mallard? 
KELLY: What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?! 
KELLY: What time is it?  
KELLY: What was that? 
KELLY: What!  
KELLY: What? 
KELLY: What? 
KELLY: What? 
KELLY: What? 
KELLY: What? 
KELLY: What? 
KELLY: What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this. 
KELLY: What?! 
KELLY: What?! 
KELLY: What?! 
KELLY: What?! Move!   
KELLY: WHAT?? 
KELLY: What's going on? 
KELLY: What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason? 
KELLY: When Deangelo's around. 
KELLY: When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager. 
KELLY: Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton? 
KELLY: Where? 
KELLY: Which time? 
KELLY: Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch. 
KELLY: Who was that? 
KELLY: Who, what? 
KELLY: Who? 
KELLY: Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this? 
KELLY: Whoo! 
KELLY: Who's Bob Hope? 
KELLY: Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now? 
KELLY: Why are you eating stem first? 
KELLY: Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit? 
KELLY: Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It s so gross. 
KELLY: Why is it so tight? 
KELLY: Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time? If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking. I'll do it. I don't care. 
KELLY: Why is that? 
KELLY: Why not? 
KELLY: Why should I pretend that you are my boss? 
KELLY: Why? 
KELLY: Why? 
KELLY: Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception? 
KELLY: Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me.  Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone! 
KELLY: Will someone please explain what s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it s like my life is buffering. 
KELLY: With the crotch? 
KELLY: Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one!  Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong! 
KELLY: Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in. 
KELLY: Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight. 
KELLY: Wow. 
KELLY: Yeah bitch. 
KELLY: Yeah I don't like talking...   
KELLY: Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you? 
KELLY: Yeah Michael the movie is amazing! 
KELLY: Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white. 
KELLY: Yeah, but everyone else- 
KELLY: Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit. 
KELLY: Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person. 
KELLY: Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually. 
KELLY: Yeah, but why'd you give it to me? 
KELLY: Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie. 
KELLY: Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag. 
KELLY: Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia. 
KELLY: Yeah, he's weird. 
KELLY: Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous. 
KELLY: Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything. 
KELLY: Yeah, it was a great deal. 
KELLY: Yeah, it was. 
KELLY: Yeah, it would be so great if he was. 
KELLY: Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that. 
KELLY: Yeah, shut up Kevin. 
KELLY: Yeah, thanks. 
KELLY: Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it. 
KELLY: Yeah, that s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression. 
KELLY: Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point. 
KELLY: Yeah, uh, this is all of 
KELLY: Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby. 
KELLY: Yeah, well, that s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party. 
KELLY: Yeah, where are your kids? 
KELLY: Yeah, your nephew is so lame. 
KELLY: Yeah. 
KELLY: Yeah. 
KELLY: Yeah. 
KELLY: Yeah. 
KELLY: Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ...  
KELLY: Yeah. It was. 
KELLY: Yep! Yeah. He just loved having people, communicating all the time. He was like 'Come on in!" 
KELLY: Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just... 
KELLY: Yep.  
KELLY: Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me? 
KELLY: Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid. 
KELLY: Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice. 
KELLY: Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing! 
KELLY: Yes, I told everyone. 
KELLY: Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you. 
KELLY: Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage. 
KELLY: Yes? Charles, you wanted me? 
KELLY: Yo. 
KELLY: You always say that, and I almost never know. 
KELLY: You are not leaving without giving me a hug.  Ughh. 
KELLY: You are so mean. 
KELLY: You can take my Helen Fielding collection. 
KELLY: You chose this job over that job? 
KELLY: You did? I wanna see the cake. 
KELLY: You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake? 
KELLY: You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me?  
KELLY: You had carbs? That's awful. 
KELLY: You have to stop. 
KELLY: You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on. 
KELLY: You just asked a girl out on the phone! 
KELLY: You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews. 
KELLY: You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to "Pretty Woman" their asses. 
KELLY: You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap. 
KELLY: You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it.  
KELLY: You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from... 
KELLY: You know, some place romantic and expensive. 
KELLY: You look so handsome. 
KELLY: You look so pretty. 
KELLY: You love ketchup! He loves ketchup. 
KELLY: You make it so hard to love you sometimes. 
KELLY: You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if you'd like to. 
KELLY: You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him. 
KELLY: You met a woman when you were giving blood? That is so romantic. 
KELLY: You really would? 
KELLY: You said "constructive complements"; that doesn't make any sense. 
KELLY: You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo. 
KELLY: You should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories.  Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly. Oh yeah I could totally help you with that. Ok, let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams... 
KELLY: You think you re so pretty! Well you re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time! 
KELLY: You told us we had to. 
KELLY: You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh. 
KELLY: You wanted to do this. Just be brave. 
KELLY: You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael. 
KELLY: You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry. 
KELLY: You're killing him, Michael! 
KELLY: You're so funny. 
KELLY: You're such a ditz. 
KELLY: You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it.  
KENDALL:   Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with.. 
KENDALL: Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it's not something you can handle then that's a different discussion. 
KENDALL: Good. 
KENDALL: I thought it was clear with you, Holly. Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training. 
KENDALL: Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious. 
KENDALL: Really funny. 
KENDALL: Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area. Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that. 
KENDALL: Well, I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action. 
KENNY: All of it. 
KENNY: Damn jet skis! 
KENNY: Get lost! 
KENNY: Hey bro, stop wasting time with this haircut.  He's got a fifty-thousand dollar sports car. Cheers. 
KENNY: Hey Pam. 
KENNY: I knew it! 
KENNY: No, I paid them off. 
KENNY: Oh, she's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda? 
KENNY: Thanks man. 
KENNY: What's up, Pam. 
KENNY: Where? 
KENNY: Yeah get out of here. 
KENNY: YES! 
KENNY: You invited me to go shopping with you. 
KENNY: You're disgusting! 
KEVIN:  
KEVIN:  
KEVIN:  
KEVIN:  
KEVIN:  
KEVIN:  
KEVIN:  
KEVIN:  
KEVIN:  
KEVIN:   
KEVIN:   
KEVIN:   And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right."  You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done. 
KEVIN:   Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely.   
KEVIN:   Dammit Creed! I've been up since four! 
KEVIN:   Five. Five to five. 
KEVIN:   He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order.   
KEVIN:   I can't keep doing this forever. CPR 
KEVIN:   I got it.   
KEVIN:   Is there a cookie? 
KEVIN:   Just... don't answer that call! 
KEVIN:   Like that? 
KEVIN:   No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game. 
KEVIN:   Not at all. 
KEVIN:   Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God... 
KEVIN:   Oh! 
KEVIN:   This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you.   
KEVIN:   Wait, what? 
KEVIN:   What? 
KEVIN:   Yeah! 
KEVIN:   Yes. 
KEVIN:  Ah.  
KEVIN:  And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know. 
KEVIN:  Are you gonna eat with us? 
KEVIN:  At least I got chocolate. 
KEVIN:  Awesome! 
KEVIN:  Awesome! 
KEVIN:  Ben 
KEVIN:  Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here.  Michael, look. Oh, man. 
KEVIN:  Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging... 
KEVIN:  Congratu-ohhh. 
KEVIN:  Damn... 
KEVIN:  Did you see this?  
KEVIN:  Do my hands feel sweaty to you?  
KEVIN:  Do we have to? 
KEVIN:  Do you want to go out on a date with me? We can make out by the horses. 
KEVIN:  Don't you guys get it? Nobody's coming for us. 
KEVIN:  Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an.  And then double it! . 
KEVIN:  Dude, you're on TV! You re the sportscaster on channel seven. 
KEVIN:  Eleven. 
KEVIN:  'ello, mate! 
KEVIN:  Enjoying your nut? 
KEVIN:  Ew! I'll be your foot buddy. 
KEVIN:  Fire! 
KEVIN:  For your feet! 
KEVIN:  Forest. 
KEVIN:  Get lower. 
KEVIN:  Get out.  
KEVIN:  Give me the baby! 
KEVIN:  Go. 
KEVIN:  Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank. 
KEVIN:  Hello. Credit card 
KEVIN:  Help! Hello?! Oh! Help! 
KEVIN:  He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight. 
KEVIN:  Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me. 
KEVIN:  Hey Ryan, you coming? 
KEVIN:  Hey! Hey! 
KEVIN:  Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have-- 
KEVIN:  Hey, buck up, buddy! 
KEVIN:  Hey. 
KEVIN:  Hey... 
KEVIN:  Hi! 
KEVIN:  Hi. I'm Kevin.  Where did you find her? 
KEVIN:  Hurts like hell. 
KEVIN:  I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up. 
KEVIN:  I can't, it's too much!  
KEVIN:  I don't know what you're talking about.  
KEVIN:  I don't think that's vomit. 
KEVIN:  I have to go to the bathroom! 
KEVIN:  I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies. 
KEVIN:  I love this hog mama. 
KEVIN:  I understand. 
KEVIN:  I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but... 
KEVIN:  I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket! 
KEVIN:  I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed. 
KEVIN:  I... am a hero! 
KEVIN:  I... have... things... W.B. 
KEVIN:  I'm calling the meeting anyway. 
KEVIN:  I'm gonna kill you. 
KEVIN:  I'm still enjoying it. 
KEVIN:  It s just that I m so emotional. 
KEVIN:  It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it! 
KEVIN:  Jim--- Roy--- Look out! 
KEVIN:  Jim, you coming? 
KEVIN:  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore. 
KEVIN:  Les Jolies Choses. 
KEVIN:  Like that?  
KEVIN:  Little Kevin. 
KEVIN:  Look at that. She's totally flirting with him. 
KEVIN:  Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you? 
KEVIN:  Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby? 
KEVIN:  Loser. Losers.  
KEVIN:  Mama Bear! 
KEVIN:  Mean but good! 
KEVIN:  Michael, are you OK? Did you throw up in there? 
KEVIN:  Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here. I can't hold my breath that long. 
KEVIN:  My night was just like that.  Meaning normal. 
KEVIN:  No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight! 
KEVIN:  No, it does not! 
KEVIN:  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay. 
KEVIN:  Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart!  
KEVIN:  Not so fast... Fire Guy. 
KEVIN:  Oh boy! What's happening? 
KEVIN:  Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh!  I have to go to the bathroom! 
KEVIN:  Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste! 
KEVIN:  Oh, awesome!  
KEVIN:  Oh, I bet you like it. 
KEVIN:  Oh, just put these on the group tab. 
KEVIN:  Oh, that was fantastic. 
KEVIN:  Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth. 
KEVIN:  Oh, yeah! Can I spin first? 
KEVIN:  Oh... my... God. 
KEVIN:  Oh... where'd you get that hat? 
KEVIN:  OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back. 
KEVIN:  OK. 
KEVIN:  Okay, that s what I m talking about! Big money, big money!  Mug duty? 
KEVIN:  Okay. 
KEVIN:  One... 
KEVIN:  Ooh. 
KEVIN:  Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck. 
KEVIN:  Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level... 
KEVIN:  People actually dance to this. It s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though. 
KEVIN:  Riboflavin? Stonewall 
KEVIN:  Satchel! 
KEVIN:  Se or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim. 
KEVIN:  Shhh... 
KEVIN:  Shhhh... 
KEVIN:  Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I am so sorry. 
KEVIN:  Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad? 
KEVIN:  Ta-da! 
KEVIN:  Tea. 
KEVIN:  Ten. 
KEVIN:  Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets. 
KEVIN:  This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often. 
KEVIN:  This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me. 
KEVIN:  Trees. 
KEVIN:  Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person. 
KEVIN:  Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big? 
KEVIN:  What is maw?!  
KEVIN:  What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie? 
KEVIN:  What the  is that?  Oh, my... 
KEVIN:  What was that stuff? 
KEVIN:  What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song? 
KEVIN:  Whoo! 
KEVIN:  Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!? 
KEVIN:  Woah! Cool! A bouncy house! 
KEVIN:  Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion? 
KEVIN:  Yeah, people hate you. 
KEVIN:  Yeah. I'm going in. 
KEVIN:  Yeah. Low blow, puppet. 
KEVIN:  Yeahhh. 
KEVIN:  Yep. Acidic, all right. 
KEVIN:  Yes! 
KEVIN:  You guys know how to get out?  
KEVIN:  You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE. 
KEVIN:  you, Gabe! 
KEVIN: "C" is for suspension. 
KEVIN: "Ciao" Right? "Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee." 
KEVIN: "now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho." 
KEVIN: ... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal. 
KEVIN: ...unbelievable. 
KEVIN: ...What? 
KEVIN: ...when I thought I had skin cancer. 
KEVIN: 200. 
KEVIN: 314 pies. 
KEVIN: 45. 
KEVIN: A lightbul-- 
KEVIN: A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up. 
KEVIN: A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says "I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City."   
KEVIN: A wheel is supposed to spin. 
KEVIN: Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check. 
KEVIN: About what? 
KEVIN: Account...? Michael, what is going on? 
KEVIN: After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see...  It's just nice to win one. 
KEVIN: All of us? 
KEVIN: All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done? 
KEVIN: All right. 
KEVIN: All right. 
KEVIN: All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses. 
KEVIN: All-in. 
KEVIN: Already sent it to you my friend. 
KEVIN: Alright everybody, who s in?  Angela?  Don t make us come over there. 
KEVIN: Alright, let s go.  
KEVIN: An antacid that you only take once a week. 
KEVIN: An Escalade. 
KEVIN: And day. Andy and 
KEVIN: And he can get any girl that he wants. 
KEVIN: And John Wayne? 
KEVIN: And that is Dallas.  
KEVIN: Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk. 
KEVIN: Andy, are there documentary groupies? 
KEVIN: Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam. 
KEVIN: Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker. 
KEVIN: Andy, you're up, let's go! 
KEVIN: Andy. 
KEVIN: Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California. 
KEVIN: Angela s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can t eat cats. You can t eat cats, Kevin. 
KEVIN: Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party. 
KEVIN: Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping...  8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation... 
KEVIN: Angela, it is a million degrees. 
KEVIN: Angela, this is inappropriate. 
KEVIN: Angela. 
KEVIN: Another one? Darryl and 
KEVIN: Any cat, you mean. 
KEVIN: Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made. 
KEVIN: Are those the lyrics? 
KEVIN: Are you going to try it? 
KEVIN: Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight? 
KEVIN: Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right?  
KEVIN: Are you kidding me? 
KEVIN: Are you on email? 
KEVIN: Are you seeing anyone right now? 
KEVIN: Are you serious? From Star Trek? 
KEVIN: Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture. 
KEVIN: Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts. 
KEVIN: Are you sure? It is a big deal. 
KEVIN: As has Kevin! 
KEVIN: As would I. 
KEVIN: At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare. 
KEVIN: At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili. The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot. I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes. I toast my own Ancho chilies. It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations. It's probably the thing I do best. 
KEVIN: At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies. It's really cool. 
KEVIN: Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation.  Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light. 
KEVIN: Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true. 
KEVIN: Awesome! 
KEVIN: Awesome. 
KEVIN: Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay? 
KEVIN: Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis. 
KEVIN: Back off me. 
KEVIN: Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess. 
KEVIN: Bearded man boy. 
KEVIN: because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now. 
KEVIN: Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something... 
KEVIN: Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form...   What? 
KEVIN: Because of how much Angela hates it. 
KEVIN: Because of sex? 
KEVIN: Because you're gay. 
KEVIN: Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump. 
KEVIN: Because... You would love it. 
KEVIN: Better luck next time, pal. 
KEVIN: Better... 
KEVIN: Big Boobs. 
KEVIN: Big mistake. 
KEVIN: Boi-oi-oi-ing 
KEVIN: Booby honking. 
KEVIN: Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them. 
KEVIN: But I do like her just the way she is. 
KEVIN: But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan. 
KEVIN: But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers. 
KEVIN: But Phyllis, it's not his baby. 
KEVIN: But save time. More success. 
KEVIN: But that was my only pair of shoes. Hotel 
KEVIN: But the coffee in Peru is much hotter.  
KEVIN: But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple. 
KEVIN: But what are we going to do with this hacked off part? 
KEVIN: But you didn't want to start with us? 
KEVIN: But, I don't want to go to DJ's. 
KEVIN: But... 
KEVIN: Butt honking. 
KEVIN: Bye, Phillip. High five. 
KEVIN: Bye. 
KEVIN: Bye. 
KEVIN: Call it. CPR 
KEVIN: Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny. 
KEVIN: Can I get some candy, or something? 
KEVIN: Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise? 
KEVIN: Can I have your pencils? 
KEVIN: Can I join too? 
KEVIN: Can t hear you. I m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored? 
KEVIN: Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list. 
KEVIN: Can you hop? 
KEVIN: 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock. 
KEVIN: Cause that's my name. 
KEVIN: 'Cause, you're the boss! 
KEVIN: Chicken piccata, side salad. 
KEVIN: Come here  
KEVIN: Come on Jim, you're killing her! 
KEVIN: Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support.  Senator 
KEVIN: Come on, Dwight. 
KEVIN: Come on, the Three Amigos. 
KEVIN: Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it. 
KEVIN: Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero. 
KEVIN: Congrats Phil! 
KEVIN: Cookies, eh? 
KEVIN: Cool. 
KEVIN: Cool. 
KEVIN: Cool. 
KEVIN: Cool. Bye. 
KEVIN: Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, "To love's eternal glory." 
KEVIN: Cool. Okay.  Bye. 
KEVIN: Cool. Superhero. 
KEVIN: Cool. Thank God they found her, too. 
KEVIN: Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don t know. You know who s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can t fly right. I d pay to see him. But I don t have to cause the park is free! 
KEVIN: Could you just say, "these are due back Thursday"? 
KEVIN: Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy! 
KEVIN: Croak! 
KEVIN: Dammit. 
KEVIN: Damn it! 
KEVIN: Damn it!  
KEVIN: Damn it. 
KEVIN: Damn it. 
KEVIN: Damn!  
KEVIN: Did you bring us anything from Nashua? 
KEVIN: Didn't drop a single ball! 
KEVIN: Didn't you two used to do it? 
KEVIN: Different stuff. 
KEVIN: Ditto. 
KEVIN: Do we have one? 
KEVIN: Do you have any savings? 
KEVIN: Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts? 
KEVIN: Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure? 
KEVIN: Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York? 
KEVIN: Do you think we should go ? 
KEVIN: Do you want a M&M? 
KEVIN: Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says  bold front  instead of  cold front ? It s insane. 
KEVIN: Does and email count? 
KEVIN: Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it. 
KEVIN: Don t talk to me!  
KEVIN: Don t tell me what to do! Angela & 
KEVIN: Don t! oh, you must think I m not. I m using the fax, this isn t, no wait. I m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There s usually an Erin here. 
KEVIN: Don't eat it. 
KEVIN: Don't push it. 
KEVIN: Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool?  
KEVIN: Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five! 
KEVIN: Dude, you gotta believe. 
KEVIN: Dude, you should know. 
KEVIN: Dude, you will not be sorry. 
KEVIN: Dunh-duh-na-dah! 
KEVIN: Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie? 
KEVIN: Dwight s the new manager. He freaking did it. 
KEVIN: Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go. 
KEVIN: Erin, would you have lunch with me? 
KEVIN: Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you. 
KEVIN: Even I know that's weird. 
KEVIN: Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored. 
KEVIN: Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands. 
KEVIN: Exactly. 
KEVIN: Exactly. 
KEVIN: Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it. 
KEVIN: Federal and State. 
KEVIN: Finally! That old shredder sucked. 
KEVIN: Fine, fine. I ll talk normally. 
KEVIN: Fine.  
KEVIN: Fine.   
KEVIN: Fire girl.   Too soon? 
KEVIN: Firrrrre-duh guy!   
KEVIN: Five bucks says it's over 50. 
KEVIN: For birthdays! 
KEVIN: For sure.  
KEVIN: For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast! 
KEVIN: Four! 
KEVIN: Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher.  
KEVIN: Go ahead 
KEVIN: Go ahead. 
KEVIN: Go. 
KEVIN: God, I hate it. 
KEVIN: Good cookie. 
KEVIN: Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job. 
KEVIN: Good pizza. 
KEVIN: Good thing you didn't listen to me. 
KEVIN: Good thinking. 
KEVIN: Good Valentine's. 
KEVIN: Got that, bimbo? 
KEVIN: Guys come on. I'm right here. 
KEVIN: Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh. 
KEVIN: Guys, I've got some instruments right here.  
KEVIN: Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now. 
KEVIN: Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left. At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it. 
KEVIN: Guys. 
KEVIN: Guys. 
KEVIN: Guys. Angela & 
KEVIN: He got scented candles! 
KEVIN: He is black... right? And... 
KEVIN: He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right? 
KEVIN: He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass. 
KEVIN: He s not that smart. He doesn t know where I hid his duck. 
KEVIN: Hello. 
KEVIN: Hello? Hey. 
KEVIN: Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks.  It was negative. 
KEVIN: Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt. 
KEVIN: Here man.  You need that more than me. 
KEVIN: Here they come.  Boom! 
KEVIN: Here you go.  
KEVIN: Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog. 
KEVIN: Here... 
KEVIN: He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom. 
KEVIN: He's like a better-looking Andy. 
KEVIN: He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing. 
KEVIN: Hey guys it's my turn. 
KEVIN: Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912? 
KEVIN: Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me? 
KEVIN: Hey Pam, I really like your glasses. 
KEVIN: Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots. 
KEVIN: Hey Pam. 
KEVIN: Hey! 
KEVIN: Hey! 
KEVIN: Hey! 
KEVIN: Hey!  Right back atcha, bitch! 
KEVIN: Hey! I can make that error. 
KEVIN: Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage. 
KEVIN: Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird. 
KEVIN: Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more. I get very nervous talking to pretty girls. Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is. 
KEVIN: Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom? 
KEVIN: Hey, Jo! 
KEVIN: Hey, man. 
KEVIN: Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where. 
KEVIN: Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you.  Ooh!  
KEVIN: Hey, Ryan. 
KEVIN: Hey, Ryan.  
KEVIN: Hey, screw you! 
KEVIN: Hey, so how was it? I mean  the sex with Jan. 
KEVIN: Hey, this is better.  
KEVIN: Hey, we're gonna do this... 
KEVIN: Hey, you going tonight? 
KEVIN: Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book! 
KEVIN: Hey. 
KEVIN: Hey. 
KEVIN: Hey. 
KEVIN: Hey.  
KEVIN: Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you? 
KEVIN: Hi Jan, you look... tan. 
KEVIN: Hi Jan. 
KEVIN: Hi Pam, is Jim there? 
KEVIN: Hi! 
KEVIN: Hi! 
KEVIN: Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes. 
KEVIN: Hi, Toby. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
KEVIN: Hmm. 
KEVIN: Hmm. Martin? 
KEVIN: Hmm... 
KEVIN: Hold it. 
KEVIN: Hooters? 
KEVIN: Hot tamales. 
KEVIN: Hot tub party? 
KEVIN: Hot! 
KEVIN: How about Cugino's? 
KEVIN: How about, "I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?" 
KEVIN: How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about? 
KEVIN: How 'bout Cooper's then? 
KEVIN: How can we do that? She's simply wonderful. 
KEVIN: How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you? 
KEVIN: How's the candle game? 
KEVIN: How's your fart project coming? 
KEVIN: Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting. 
KEVIN: Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys? 
KEVIN: Huh? 
KEVIN: Hungrier. 
KEVIN: Hungrier. 
KEVIN: I accept your decision! 
KEVIN: I almost died. 
KEVIN: I almost died. I... I went into this skid--- 
KEVIN: I always set it at 69.  
KEVIN: I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy. And he's super funny. Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes. He's all the way over there. 
KEVIN: I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle! 
KEVIN: I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way. 
KEVIN: I am Oscar Martinez. 
KEVIN: I am so sorry. 
KEVIN: I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you? 
KEVIN: I bet you were. 
KEVIN: I brought them from home! Do you have a red? 
KEVIN: I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this? 
KEVIN: I can't believe we're missing that! 
KEVIN: I can't decide what to get. 
KEVIN: I can't even imagine. 
KEVIN: I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good.  Oh yeah! 
KEVIN: I can't relax about it, you know? 
KEVIN: I can't wait. 
KEVIN: I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder. 
KEVIN: I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken. 
KEVIN: I could sing it. 
KEVIN: I didn't eat lunch.   I didn't eat all my lunch. 
KEVIN: I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted! 
KEVIN: I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before. 
KEVIN: I didn't see where it was. 
KEVIN: I do gamble Michael. 
KEVIN: I do know how to read though! 
KEVIN: I do not want to talk about it. 
KEVIN: I do the numbers. 
KEVIN: I do. 
KEVIN: I do.  Come on everyone... 
KEVIN: I don t get it. 
KEVIN: I don t know. 
KEVIN: I don t think so. 
KEVIN: I don't feel anything. 
KEVIN: I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because... 
KEVIN: I don't know. 
KEVIN: I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that. 
KEVIN: I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael. 
KEVIN: I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny. 
KEVIN: I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk. 
KEVIN: I don't want people making fun of my weight. 
KEVIN: I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right. 
KEVIN: I feel scared a little. 
KEVIN: I got a gift for Pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one? 
KEVIN: I got a lot of numbers here to put together. 
KEVIN: I got Little Kevin Call of Duty. 
KEVIN: I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't . 
KEVIN: I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff. 
KEVIN: I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out. 
KEVIN: I guess I could be nicer. 
KEVIN: I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day. 
KEVIN: I have a hoop in my driveway. 
KEVIN: I have a tambourine. 
KEVIN: I have to go to the bathroom!  
KEVIN: I have very little patience for stupidity. 
KEVIN: I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela  Hmmm... 
KEVIN: I heard they made out and had sex. 
KEVIN: I insult you! To your face! 
KEVIN: I insult you, Oscar. 
KEVIN: I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes. 
KEVIN: I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it. 
KEVIN: I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say,  Look, a balloon.  
KEVIN: I just thought- 
KEVIN: I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted. 
KEVIN: I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man.  
KEVIN: I knew it! 
KEVIN: I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought "Oh, she has a new bra with padding." But then I thought "Pam doesn't need padding." It just didn't add up, Jim. 
KEVIN: I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone. 
KEVIN: I know how you got it.  
KEVIN: I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night. 
KEVIN: I know! It s alphabetical. 
KEVIN: I know. But sometimes you still get a little something. 
KEVIN: I know... 
KEVIN: I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet. Hotel 
KEVIN: I ll take him. 
KEVIN: I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers. 
KEVIN: I m good. 
KEVIN: I m losing my balance. 
KEVIN: I m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that don t exist like ghosts or mummies. 
KEVIN: I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome. 
KEVIN: I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat. 
KEVIN: I miss Stacy. 
KEVIN: I missed you! 
KEVIN: I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls? 
KEVIN: I never seen herpes on you. 
KEVIN: I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that. 
KEVIN: I remember. Mr. 
KEVIN: I said see you later building. 
KEVIN: I suck. 
KEVIN: I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake. 
KEVIN: I think he's singing. 
KEVIN: I think I blew it. It all happened so fast. So... fast. 
KEVIN: I think I should call her. 
KEVIN: I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know. 
KEVIN: I think it should be a surprise. 
KEVIN: I think it's over, man. 
KEVIN: I think Karen has a prettier face. 
KEVIN: I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash. 
KEVIN: I think that's from Big. 
KEVIN: I think this thing is broken. 
KEVIN: I think we're out. 
KEVIN: I think we're ready to give thi-  Jim? 
KEVIN: I think you do, mon. 
KEVIN: I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie. 
KEVIN: I think you kids have a lot to catch up on. 
KEVIN: I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name? 
KEVIN: I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast. 
KEVIN: I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot. 
KEVIN: I totally forgot about the affair for a minute.  Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know.  Her life is a complete sham! 
KEVIN: I used to go there with my fiance  . Before she left me  . No, I mean, before I left her  . She left me.   
KEVIN: I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone. 
KEVIN: I ve never met anyone like that. 
KEVIN: I want the foot bath. 
KEVIN: I wanted a cookie. 
KEVIN: I was looking at pictures of food on my computer. 
KEVIN: I was looking for patterns. 
KEVIN: I wish my car had a bathroom. 
KEVIN: I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what? 
KEVIN: I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker. 
KEVIN: I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time.  
KEVIN: I wonder what he did. 
KEVIN: I would so rather be in prison. 
KEVIN: I would want to live with no legs. 
KEVIN: I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party. 
KEVIN: I... did not. 
KEVIN: I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not? 
KEVIN: I'd like a magazine. 
KEVIN: I'd still like one. 
KEVIN: If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy. 
KEVIN: If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself. 
KEVIN: If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that. 
KEVIN: If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a very rich dude. 
KEVIN: If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it s that if you film anybody long enough, they re going to do something stupid. It s only human natural. 
KEVIN: I'll go to the diner with you. 
KEVIN: I'm almost done. 
KEVIN: I'm from here! 
KEVIN: I'm going to call him Little Kevin. 
KEVIN: I'm going to enjoy this. 
KEVIN: I'm going to help you. 
KEVIN: I'm going to! 
KEVIN: I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent. 
KEVIN: I'm guessing not. 
KEVIN: I'm Kevin. 
KEVIN: I'm not crying. 
KEVIN: I'm not gay. I'm Kevin. 
KEVIN: I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher. 
KEVIN: I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut. 
KEVIN: I'm not taking Rogaine. 
KEVIN: I'm on it. 
KEVIN: I'm petrified. 
KEVIN: I'm right here!  Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath. 
KEVIN: I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best. 
KEVIN: I'm sorry. 
KEVIN: I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me. 
KEVIN: I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee. 
KEVIN: In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later. 
KEVIN: In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need. 
KEVIN: Interesting. 
KEVIN: Is everything ok, Michael? 
KEVIN: Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious. 
KEVIN: Is that all it was? 
KEVIN: Is that what I think it is?   
KEVIN: Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party? 
KEVIN: Isn't it supposed to be, "Drive safely"? 
KEVIN: It feels amazing! 
KEVIN: It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here. 
KEVIN: It feels unbelievable! 
KEVIN: It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery  
KEVIN: It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it. 
KEVIN: It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A! 
KEVIN: It s a answer. 
KEVIN: It s not a kid on a bike. It s a man in a car. 
KEVIN: It smelled terrible. Pam and 
KEVIN: It smells like cookies. 
KEVIN: It smells like throw up in here. 
KEVIN: It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates  Monster Mash.  I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid! 
KEVIN: It was great to see you, Jan. 
KEVIN: It was kind of hard to hear. 
KEVIN: It was me. 
KEVIN: It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again. 
KEVIN: It... yeah. 
KEVIN: Italian. 
KEVIN: It's a bitter situation. 
KEVIN: It's a good idea. 
KEVIN: It's a trap. 
KEVIN: It's been out for ages, man. 
KEVIN: It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this. 
KEVIN: It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week. 
KEVIN: It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here.  Pam?  
KEVIN: It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F... 
KEVIN: It's like Club Med, but everything is naked. 
KEVIN: It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. 
KEVIN: It's out in the hall. 
KEVIN: It's six to six. It's a nail-biter.   
KEVIN: It's too big of a pill to swallow. 
KEVIN: I've dumped better than Erin. 
KEVIN: I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes.  
KEVIN: I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it. 
KEVIN: I've never, ever seen you take a sick day. 
KEVIN: James Bond was a spy. 
KEVIN: Jan. 
KEVIN: Jim has got it bad for Pam. 
KEVIN: Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen. 
KEVIN: Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, Ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  Which doesn't exist. 
KEVIN: Jim said that? 
KEVIN: Jim said that? 
KEVIN: Jim, put it on. 
KEVIN: Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks. 
KEVIN: Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap. 
KEVIN: Jo, I think that I know what happened. 
KEVIN: Jo, there's books in my chair. 
KEVIN: Just admit that your baby was a mistake. 
KEVIN: Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous. 
KEVIN: Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast. 
KEVIN: Just hurry.  
KEVIN: Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman? 
KEVIN: Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits. 
KEVIN: 'Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that...  like, forget it. 
KEVIN: Kelly, that is mine! This is mine!  
KEVIN: Kevin Malone. Bob 
KEVIN: Kevin. 
KEVIN: Knead it. Knead it like a pizza. 
KEVIN: Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy. 
KEVIN: Later Jim. 
KEVIN: Later, Jim. 
KEVIN: Later, man. 
KEVIN: Later. 
KEVIN: Let s get this over with, Pam. 
KEVIN: Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home. Stonewall 
KEVIN: Like librarians. 
KEVIN: Like money? Like you-- you want my money? 
KEVIN: Listen, it s important. You ve gotta hear this. 
KEVIN: Little old man boy. 
KEVIN: Long johns? A shaw? 
KEVIN: Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge?  Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge. 
KEVIN: Look who it is!  
KEVIN: Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of 
KEVIN: Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael. 
KEVIN: Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking. 
KEVIN: Make it go taller. 
KEVIN: Man, Darryl, I'm sorry.  Happy Birthday. 
KEVIN: Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight. 
KEVIN: Man, that thing's bigger than I am. Delivery 
KEVIN: Many small time make big time. 
KEVIN: Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film. 
KEVIN: Maybe some spagh-etti. 
KEVIN: Maybe we should warm up with some scales? 
KEVIN: Maybe you could just change the U into an A. 
KEVIN: Me and Pete are building a tower. 
KEVIN: Me do it now. Go. Stop worry. 
KEVIN: Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night. 
KEVIN: Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say  car no go , and we best friends. So me 
KEVIN: Me too. 
KEVIN: Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that. 
KEVIN: Me, me, me, me, me me.  Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so... 
KEVIN: Me. 
KEVIN: Me? 
KEVIN: Meredith, I tell you all the time. 
KEVIN: Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar.  
KEVIN: Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes. 
KEVIN: Michael could win. 
KEVIN: Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis. 
KEVIN: Michael is that a wig? 
KEVIN: Michael is that scotch? 
KEVIN: Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap. 
KEVIN: Michael Scarn! 
KEVIN: Michael you could put your initials in it. 
KEVIN: Michael! 
KEVIN: Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks. 
KEVIN: Michael, did you tell your mom yet? 
KEVIN: Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you. 
KEVIN: Michael, how did it go?  
KEVIN: Michael, I didn't get a gift bag. 
KEVIN: Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay. 
KEVIN: Michael, I hated the twirl. 
KEVIN: Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out. 
KEVIN: Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him. 
KEVIN: Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now. 
KEVIN: Michael, isn't that Holly? 
KEVIN: Michael, please he-- 
KEVIN: Michael, should I call the...  What? 
KEVIN: Michael, that was fun. 
KEVIN: Michael, the baby's already been born. 
KEVIN: Michael, what does a bean mean? 
KEVIN: Michael, why don't we get outdoors time? 
KEVIN: Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith? 
KEVIN: Michael, you might lose your condo. 
KEVIN: Michael, you're at least forty six! 
KEVIN: Michael. 
KEVIN: Michael.  
KEVIN: Michael? 
KEVIN: Michael? 
KEVIN: Michael's a genius. 
KEVIN: Michael's movie? Two thumbs down.  Heh. 
KEVIN: MILF! 
KEVIN: Mine. 
KEVIN: Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people? 
KEVIN: Mm-hmm. 
KEVIN: My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it. 
KEVIN: My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien- 
KEVIN: My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill. 
KEVIN: My money's on Pam. 
KEVIN: My name is Kevin. 
KEVIN: My tire blew out on the way here, Michael. 
KEVIN: My worst breakup was with Stacy. It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said "Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!" and she said that we're done. 
KEVIN: Never trust a cookie with a woman s name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. They ll just break your heart. 
KEVIN: Next stop pies! 
KEVIN: Ni- 
KEVIN: Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit! 
KEVIN: Nice outfit. 
KEVIN: Nice! 
KEVIN: Nice! 
KEVIN: Nice! 
KEVIN: Nice!  
KEVIN: Nice! We got burned! 
KEVIN: Nice! Yeah. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
KEVIN: Nice.   Boobs.   
KEVIN: Nice. Nice. 
KEVIN: Nice. Pretty soon, we re gonna be at the ceiling. 
KEVIN: Nice... she is so hot. 
KEVIN: Nicely done! 
KEVIN: Night, Oscar. 
KEVIN: Night, Pam. 
KEVIN: Niiice. 
KEVIN: No- 
KEVIN: No but that's not fair. 
KEVIN: No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything.  I'm even gonna kiss Meredith.  That is... hmph... that's ah... so good.  
KEVIN: No he's not the boss. 
KEVIN: No Jim, tell 'em what a name is. 
KEVIN: No me fault. 
KEVIN: no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life. 
KEVIN: No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding. 
KEVIN: No way! 
KEVIN: No way. 
KEVIN: No way. 
KEVIN: No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace. 
KEVIN: No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn. 
KEVIN: No! 
KEVIN: No! 
KEVIN: No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone! 
KEVIN: No! It was my idea to not be raped! 
KEVIN: No! This is not fair! This is my idea. He s trying to steal it because he s jealous of me. 
KEVIN: No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this. 
KEVIN: No, but maybe the reason  
KEVIN: No, constantly. Like, for years. 
KEVIN: No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen. 
KEVIN: No, I- 
KEVIN: No, I don t need this! And you obviously don t need me. 
KEVIN: No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath. 
KEVIN: No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see. 
KEVIN: No, it is definitely under one of these hands.  
KEVIN: No, it is here. 
KEVIN: No, it's just... that old shredder sucks.  Just get one that'll shred magazines. 
KEVIN: No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year. 
KEVIN: No, it's not. 
KEVIN: No, no, that makes total sense. 
KEVIN: No, no. 
KEVIN: No, not taller this way, taller this way.  
KEVIN: No, not yet. 
KEVIN: No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner. 
KEVIN: No, thirty. 
KEVIN: No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants. 
KEVIN: No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye.  It was just Stacy. 
KEVIN: No, under the jacket. 
KEVIN: No, watching TV at work is really cool. 
KEVIN: No. 
KEVIN: No. 
KEVIN: No. 
KEVIN: No. 
KEVIN: No. 
KEVIN: No. 
KEVIN: No. 
KEVIN: No. 
KEVIN: No. I won't say it. 
KEVIN: No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner.  . Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way!  
KEVIN: No. I'm still waiting. 
KEVIN: No. No he's not. 
KEVIN: No. That... I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer. 
KEVIN: No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed. 
KEVIN: No. Yes! 
KEVIN: None taken. 
KEVIN: Nooo! 
KEVIN: Nope.  
KEVIN: Nope. I did not see you either. 
KEVIN: Nope. Stacy broke up with me. 
KEVIN: Not anymore. 
KEVIN: Not food and stuff. 
KEVIN: Now, Jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign. 
KEVIN: Obviously. He s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he s not the sharpest guy in the drawer. 
KEVIN: Of course. 
KEVIN: Of course. 
KEVIN: Oh come on! He's right there.   He was hired.   Oh check it out, "Hired Guy." 
KEVIN: Oh come on, man! Believe in something. 
KEVIN: Oh God. 
KEVIN: Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you. 
KEVIN: Oh hey guys. 
KEVIN: Oh I'm in. 
KEVIN: Oh man, do you think it was stolen? 
KEVIN: Oh man, this is weird! 
KEVIN: Oh no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage. 
KEVIN: Oh no, that's, that's not happening. 
KEVIN: Oh really?  Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award!  
KEVIN: Oh that is nice. Classy move.  
KEVIN: Oh yeah! 
KEVIN: Oh yeah! 
KEVIN: Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits.  Again.  
KEVIN: Oh yeah. 
KEVIN: Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome. 
KEVIN: Oh yes. 
KEVIN: Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail. 
KEVIN: Oh zip it. 
KEVIN: Oh! 
KEVIN: Oh!  
KEVIN: Oh! Can I be  Australian, mate? 
KEVIN: Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning? 
KEVIN: Oh, but you still said "I'm sorry." 
KEVIN: Oh, did I win the pool? 
KEVIN: Oh, geeze. 
KEVIN: Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation? 
KEVIN: Oh, I bet Jim goes too. 
KEVIN: Oh, I bet you ask? 
KEVIN: Oh, I definitely do. 
KEVIN: Oh, I don t know. 
KEVIN: Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'. 
KEVIN: Oh, I hit three. I hit three. 
KEVIN: Oh, I missed you so much. 
KEVIN: Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny. 
KEVIN: Oh, I think it's 18 hundo. 
KEVIN: Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit. 
KEVIN: Oh, I'll take 'em. 
KEVIN: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away. 
KEVIN: Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now? 
KEVIN: Oh, man! 
KEVIN: Oh, my God! 
KEVIN: Oh, nice! 
KEVIN: Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us! 
KEVIN: Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs? 
KEVIN: Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde? 
KEVIN: Oh, right. Thanks.   Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you.   Oscar, your mom! 
KEVIN: Oh, right. The state senator. 
KEVIN: Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me. 
KEVIN: Oh, that would be impressive... if anyone knew what a comptroller was. 
KEVIN: Oh, that's ridiculous. 
KEVIN: Oh, the Nets are super tough.  
KEVIN: Oh, the other one's watching. 
KEVIN: Oh, then pick TV. 
KEVIN: Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I m not that good at puzzles. 
KEVIN: Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now? 
KEVIN: Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, "Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--" 
KEVIN: Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff. 
KEVIN: Oh, yes I can. 
KEVIN: Oh, Yes! 
KEVIN: Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking.  
KEVIN: Oh. 
KEVIN: Oh... 
KEVIN: Ohh. 
KEVIN: Ohhh... 
KEVIN: OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them. 
KEVIN: Ok guys,  we all drink them all . 
KEVIN: Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again. 
KEVIN: OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip. 
KEVIN: Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island. 
KEVIN: Ok. 
KEVIN: Ok. Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year... 
KEVIN: OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money. 
KEVIN: OK... Who wants to guess when the baby will be born? 
KEVIN: Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot. 
KEVIN: Okay, bye. 
KEVIN: Okay, I got this one. 
KEVIN: Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds. 
KEVIN: Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty. 
KEVIN: Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life. 
KEVIN: Okay, Michael. 
KEVIN: Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony? 
KEVIN: Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi. 
KEVIN: Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that s the guy that Erin s flirting with? Dance 
KEVIN: Okay, well then, uh, I mean, maybe we could do it like... next Halloween. 
KEVIN: Okay. 
KEVIN: Okay. 
KEVIN: Okay. 
KEVIN: Okay.  
KEVIN: Okay. Andy, get ready.   Transfer. Extension. Transfer. 
KEVIN: Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway. 
KEVIN: Okay. The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild. 
KEVIN: Okay. Watch my toes.  
KEVIN: Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see.  what do 'I' want?... 
KEVIN: Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first. 
KEVIN: On what? 
KEVIN: One order. 
KEVIN: One order. 
KEVIN: One!  
KEVIN: One, two, three.  
KEVIN: Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each? 
KEVIN: Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy! 
KEVIN: Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together. 
KEVIN: Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions. 
KEVIN: Ooh, I haven t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato? 
KEVIN: Ooh, it s when you get a free sandwich after you ve already eaten ten sandwiches. 
KEVIN: Ooh, ooh! 
KEVIN: Ooh, there s a great play about a salesman. 
KEVIN: Ooh, there s Angela! I work with her! 
KEVIN: Ooh. 
KEVIN: oooh 
KEVIN: Oooh yeah...  Jim and Pam! 
KEVIN: Oooh!  
KEVIN: Oooh. 
KEVIN: Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going? 
KEVIN: Oooo, now do the Swedish chef. 
KEVIN: Oooo. 
KEVIN: Open QuickTime. 
KEVIN: Or carnivals! 
KEVIN: Or the me that stinks. 
KEVIN: Or when we're bored. 
KEVIN: Or you're dead. 
KEVIN: Oscar, I would be proud to date you. 
KEVIN: Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges. 
KEVIN: Oscar, talk to him. 
KEVIN: Oscar, we're in the middle of talking. 
KEVIN: Oscar. Angela. 
KEVIN: Oscar. Angela. 
KEVIN: Oscar. Oscar.  I think I m gay. 
KEVIN: Our question is it seems dumb. 
KEVIN: Our ultra feast menu's 
KEVIN: Packer said it. 
KEVIN: Packer, we accept.  Todd 
KEVIN: Pam is taller. 
KEVIN: Pam! Pam, look out! Erin s gunning for your job! 
KEVIN: Pam, look out! 
KEVIN: Pam, you weigh 226 pounds? 
KEVIN: Pam. 
KEVIN: Pam. Can you vote for other people? 
KEVIN: Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen. 
KEVIN: Pam? 
KEVIN: Pam's back on the market again. 
KEVIN: People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair.  It's the hair--  Ok. Ok. I'm going.  God. 
KEVIN: People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right!  Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks! 
KEVIN: Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day. 
KEVIN: Pete what? 
KEVIN: Pete... 
KEVIN: Phillip got this for me? 
KEVIN: Phillip is so fat. 
KEVIN: Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip. 
KEVIN: Phones? 
KEVIN: Phyllis? 
KEVIN: Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with. 
KEVIN: Please hold.   Andy! Phone call. 
KEVIN: Please Michael, just make the Glee happen! 
KEVIN: Please, stop. 
KEVIN: Please, stop. 
KEVIN: Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass? 
KEVIN: Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner. 
KEVIN: Present company excluded? 
KEVIN: Push harder, Dwight. 
KEVIN: Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit. 
KEVIN: Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit. 
KEVIN: Q. 
KEVIN: Really, really fun. 
KEVIN: Red gloves. 
KEVIN: Reeeeally. 
KEVIN: Right. 
KEVIN: Right. 
KEVIN: Right. 
KEVIN: Right. 
KEVIN: Right. My mom- 
KEVIN: Right. Now. 
KEVIN: Riiight. The gym.  
KEVIN: Romances? 
KEVIN: Ron Artest, Kelly. 
KEVIN: Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said "awesome" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies. 
KEVIN: See world. 
KEVIN: See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China. 
KEVIN: Set! 
KEVIN: She goes to another school. 
KEVIN: She looks like a monster. 
KEVIN: She looks like Pam from the neck down. 
KEVIN: She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin. 
KEVIN: She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown. 
KEVIN: She thought I was your boyfriend. 
KEVIN: She touched my shoulder. 
KEVIN: She wasn't that hot. 
KEVIN: She's prettier than you though. 
KEVIN: Shh, here she comes! 
KEVIN: Shh. 
KEVIN: Shoot. 
KEVIN: Should we just keep opening up the presents? 
KEVIN: Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places. 
KEVIN: Six-six-five-zero. 
KEVIN: So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around? 
KEVIN: So DARRYL! A GIRL! 
KEVIN: So did you hear? 
KEVIN: So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back? 
KEVIN: So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one! 
KEVIN: So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea. 
KEVIN: So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time. 
KEVIN: So if you need anything, I'm right over there. 
KEVIN: So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen? 
KEVIN: So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in? 
KEVIN: So long, noise! 
KEVIN: So now anyone gets to talk at any times? 
KEVIN: So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them. 
KEVIN: So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us? 
KEVIN: So what do we do now? 
KEVIN: So, like, a disco cafe? 
KEVIN: So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we re gonna be best friends. He s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you. 
KEVIN: So, there was talk of oatmeal. 
KEVIN: So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet? 
KEVIN: So... you're going to provide them, then? 
KEVIN: Someone has it. 
KEVIN: Something with animals. Or people. 
KEVIN: Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times! 
KEVIN: Sometimes we play "Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?" 
KEVIN: Sometimes. 
KEVIN: Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks. 
KEVIN: Sounds beautiful! 
KEVIN: Stacy. 
KEVIN: Staples. 
KEVIN: Stay away from my mom. 
KEVIN: Stay. 
KEVIN: Stick spicy food up her butt. 
KEVIN: Still said it. 
KEVIN: Still scary. 
KEVIN: Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you. 
KEVIN: Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you. 
KEVIN: Sweep the leg. 
KEVIN: T minus... 
KEVIN: T. 
KEVIN: Taste test? I m in! 
KEVIN: Thank God. 
KEVIN: Thank you, Holly. 
KEVIN: Thank you, Michael. 
KEVIN: Thank you. 
KEVIN: Thank you. 
KEVIN: Thank you. 
KEVIN: Thank you. 
KEVIN: Thank you. 
KEVIN: Thank you.  It really makes me self-conscious about my voice. 
KEVIN: Thank you. Hotel 
KEVIN: Thank. 
KEVIN: Thanks for the party, Michael. 
KEVIN: That could be a good sign. 
KEVIN: That he's wasted 15 years of your life? 
KEVIN: That is a dangerous game, friendo. 
KEVIN: That is hilarious.  
KEVIN: That is lame. 
KEVIN: That is my name. 
KEVIN: That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you. Hours and hours. 
KEVIN: That is not the question. 
KEVIN: That is so good, Michael 
KEVIN: That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady! 
KEVIN: That s a flush. 
KEVIN: That s not  
KEVIN: That s the winter season., three months. 
KEVIN: That s totally uncool. 
KEVIN: That sounds epic. Can we bring anything? 
KEVIN: That sounds like Pam. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  Kevin... 
KEVIN: That sucks so much. 
KEVIN: That was a really cool move. 
KEVIN: That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them? 
KEVIN: That was awesome! 
KEVIN: That was so awesome. 
KEVIN: That's a real thing. 
KEVIN: That's awesome! 
KEVIN: That's beautiful. No, I totally get that. 
KEVIN: That's hilarious. 
KEVIN: That's me.  
KEVIN: That's not fair. 
KEVIN: That's pretty young. 
KEVIN: That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim. 
KEVIN: That's really comfortable.  
KEVIN: That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it. 
KEVIN: That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it.  Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot. 
KEVIN: That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model. 
KEVIN: The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you? 
KEVIN: The beef is poisoned? 
KEVIN: The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize. 
KEVIN: The branch closed. Forever. 
KEVIN: The debate is whether she is hot. 
KEVIN: The fire pit is a no-brainer. 
KEVIN: The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him "Cool Guy Paul." W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean. 
KEVIN: The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life. 
KEVIN: The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible. 
KEVIN: The Mark 47 is ready for launch.  Less paste. 
KEVIN: The mob. 
KEVIN: The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked? 
KEVIN: The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on. 
KEVIN: The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore. 
KEVIN: The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling. 
KEVIN: The thing you just said? 
KEVIN: The tires look pretty worn. 
KEVIN: Their bread's really good. 
KEVIN: Then I won't let you down. 
KEVIN: Then see you later building. 
KEVIN: Then why are there two flyers? 
KEVIN: Then why don't you do something about it? 
KEVIN: There are no wrong answers. 
KEVIN: There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type. 
KEVIN: They call me Kevin. 
KEVIN: They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day. 
KEVIN: They have no idea what happened. 
KEVIN: They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion. 
KEVIN: They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out. 
KEVIN: They were stolen? Hotel 
KEVIN: They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me. 
KEVIN: They're really upset about the whole Danny situation. 
KEVIN: This all sounds great to me.  But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think. 
KEVIN: This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo. 
KEVIN: This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it? 
KEVIN: This is awesome. Thanks, you guys. 
KEVIN: This is flatter. 
KEVIN: This is getting weird. 
KEVIN: This is ridiculous. 
KEVIN: This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money? 
KEVIN: This is the best meeting we've ever had. 
KEVIN: This is where we go 
KEVIN: This isn't funny. I don't talk like that.  
KEVIN: This sucks. 
KEVIN: This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh!  Shoot. 
KEVIN: This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's. 
KEVIN: Three  
KEVIN: Three hundred pounds! 
KEVIN: Three queens. 
KEVIN: Tip-top shape. 
KEVIN: To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops. 
KEVIN: Totally! 
KEVIN: Totally. George Clooney. 
KEVIN: True, it's best to hide our money problems from women. 
KEVIN: Try it in another sentence. 
KEVIN: Tuna Tuna Tuna. 
KEVIN: Tuna. Check you later. 
KEVIN: Turn the trash. Turn the trash. 
KEVIN: Two   
KEVIN: Uh huh. 
KEVIN: Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar? 
KEVIN: Uh oh. 
KEVIN: Uh oh. She's doing it again. 
KEVIN: Uh, the man tree puts its penis- 
KEVIN: Um, I might have skin cancer. 
KEVIN: Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday. 
KEVIN: Um, yes.  Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA 
KEVIN: Um... Business! 
KEVIN: Uno! Dos! Tres!  
KEVIN: W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and--- Bill 
KEVIN: Waaaah!  Waaaaah! Mommy! 
KEVIN: Waaah!  
KEVIN: Wag. 
KEVIN: Wait a minute. Yes I am. 
KEVIN: Wait til' Monday. 
KEVIN: Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe? Or Pizza by Alfredo? 
KEVIN: Wait, all of them? 
KEVIN: Wait, are they searching all our computers? 
KEVIN: Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded? 
KEVIN: Wait, C-R-A-Z... 
KEVIN: Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?  
KEVIN: Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream? 
KEVIN: Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself. 
KEVIN: Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird. 
KEVIN: Wait, why am I a racist? 
KEVIN: Wait, you didn't give it back? 
KEVIN: Warning! Warning! Warning! 
KEVIN: WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! 
KEVIN: Was he in to you in like a gay way? 
KEVIN: Was it worth it? 
KEVIN: Way to go, man. 
KEVIN: Wayne Johnson? The Rock? 
KEVIN: We all got to go sometime. 
KEVIN: We call it Hate Ball. 
KEVIN: We did it. 
KEVIN: We do. 
KEVIN: We don't tell her. 
KEVIN: We got our spaces back. 
KEVIN: We have to. 
KEVIN: We need a warning signal. 
KEVIN: We need to assemble the five families. 
KEVIN: We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band. 
KEVIN: We think it's a straight forward kidnapping. 
KEVIN: We want our parking spaces back! Paul 
KEVIN: Welcome home. 
KEVIN: Well I can t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me. 
KEVIN: Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips. 
KEVIN: Well I m just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don t know the woman. 
KEVIN: Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call. 
KEVIN: Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty! 
KEVIN: Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott. 
KEVIN: Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back. 
KEVIN: Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information. 
KEVIN: Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding? 
KEVIN: We'll stay late. 
KEVIN: Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine. 
KEVIN: Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You re too character-y to be a lead and you re not fat enough to be a great character actor. 
KEVIN: Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol- 
KEVIN: Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape. 
KEVIN: Well, I am.  
KEVIN: Well, I heard they made out and had sex. 
KEVIN: Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none. 
KEVIN: Well, I think that the real question 
KEVIN: Well, I wish for a million wishes. 
KEVIN: Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work. 
KEVIN: Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show. 
KEVIN: Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me. And that was really cool. 
KEVIN: Well, now I think I might not. 
KEVIN: Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut. 
KEVIN: Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever. 
KEVIN: Well, w  
KEVIN: Well, well, well, well, well, well. That s six  wells.  Did I get that number right, Dwight? 
KEVIN: Well, what if you're cold? 
KEVIN: Well, why don't you shut up! 
KEVIN: Well, you are the one in charge of it. 
KEVIN: Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So... 
KEVIN: Well... well damn-it. Hotel 
KEVIN: We're bored a lot. 
KEVIN: We're called Kevin and the Zits. 
KEVIN: We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end. 
KEVIN: We're here for the show, Michael. 
KEVIN: We're not listening. 
KEVIN: Wh... 
KEVIN: Wha-- wh-- 
KEVIN: What 
KEVIN: What - 
KEVIN: What a chubbers. Whoa. 
KEVIN: What about if I tell you the things I don't want? 
KEVIN: What am I going to do?  I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art.  
KEVIN: What an awesome party. The best wedding I've ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic. My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  Whoo. My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold. What a lovely hotel. 
KEVIN: What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What? 
KEVIN: What are you doing? 
KEVIN: What are you guys talking about? 
KEVIN: What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who...  Everyone is listening to me.  
KEVIN: What do you mean? 
KEVIN: What do you think that was about? 
KEVIN: What does a bean mean? 
KEVIN: What does a bean mean? 
KEVIN: What does a bean mean?! 
KEVIN: What does that mean? 
KEVIN: What does that mean? 
KEVIN: What does that mean? 
KEVIN: What does this mean? What does it mean! 
KEVIN: What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means. 
KEVIN: What else you got? 
KEVIN: What happened? 
KEVIN: What if he dies in the fire? And that's the last thing you ever said to him. 
KEVIN: What is he doing? 
KEVIN: What is it? 
KEVIN: What is your type? 
KEVIN: What s happening in three months? 
KEVIN: What the hell? 
KEVIN: What was that word they said when they showed me  Skrald mand ? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy?  
KEVIN: What, no candy? 
KEVIN: What? 
KEVIN: What? 
KEVIN: What? 
KEVIN: What? Hotel 
KEVIN: What? I m moving the ink down in my pen, for work. 
KEVIN: What?!? No! 
KEVIN: What're you doing? You never have plans. 
KEVIN: What's different about you? You look worse. 
KEVIN: What's goin' on? 
KEVIN: What's going on? 
KEVIN: What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie? 
KEVIN: When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny. 
KEVIN: When can I sit on your lap? 
KEVIN: When do we leave? 
KEVIN: When he started the fire. 
KEVIN: When me President, they see.  They see. 
KEVIN: When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel. 
KEVIN: When will the new copier be ready? 
KEVIN: Where are we going? 
KEVIN: Where s the, uh, basket for gifts? 
KEVIN: Whether it s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity. 
KEVIN: Whhh... What are you guys doing? 
KEVIN: Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces. 
KEVIN: Who makes it? 
KEVIN: Who would want it? 
KEVIN: Whoa! 
KEVIN: Whoa! 
KEVIN: Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand. 
KEVIN: Whoa, I'll try it. 
KEVIN: Whoa. 
KEVIN: Whoa.

KEVIN: Yeah, I agree. This is nasty. 
KEVIN: Yeah, I don t think that you understand wheels.

KEVIN: Yeah, I say we just go for it! 
KEVIN: Yeah, I think she's full of it. 
KEVIN: Yeah, I think this day could get worse. 
KEVIN: Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break. 
KEVIN: Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it. 
KEVIN: Yeah, it won't shred magazines. 
KEVIN: Yeah, it'll be you. 
KEVIN: Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually... 
KEVIN: Yeah, later dude. 
KEVIN: Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone. 
KEVIN: Yeah, me too. 
KEVIN: Yeah, me too. 
KEVIN: Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo... 
KEVIN: Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you. 
KEVIN: Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says "no," then she is not interested. 
KEVIN: Yeah, Michael, I just uh... 
KEVIN: Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here. 
KEVIN: Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day. 
KEVIN: Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this. 
KEVIN: Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble. 
KEVIN: Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom. 
KEVIN: Yeah, thank you Phyllis. 
KEVIN: Yeah, that you're being really mean, Andy. 
KEVIN: Yeah, we all need a drink.  What the there s only dandelion tea and raisins in here. 
KEVIN: Yeah, we can go eat pie.

KEVIN: Yeah. 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
KEVIN: Yeah.  
KEVIN: Yeah.  
KEVIN: Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it. 
KEVIN: Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.' 
KEVIN: Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice. 
KEVIN: Yeah. Every single day. 
KEVIN: Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake. Todd 
KEVIN: Yeah. How was it? 
KEVIN: Yeah. I heard you might need it. So... 
KEVIN: Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them. 
KEVIN: Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board. 
KEVIN: Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package. 
KEVIN: Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand. 
KEVIN: Yeah. Oh. 
KEVIN: Yeah. Respect the lei. 
KEVIN: Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck. 
KEVIN: Yeah. That's pretty bad. 
KEVIN: Yeah. This place is great. 
KEVIN: Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell. 
KEVIN: Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know. 
KEVIN: Yeah... what do you mean exactly? 
KEVIN: Yeah? 
KEVIN: Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left. 
KEVIN: Yeah? Okay, this is awesome. 
KEVIN: Yep, yep, yep. 
KEVIN: Yep. 
KEVIN: Yes!

KEVIN: Yes!  
KEVIN: Yes!  
KEVIN: Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn t know, you didn t know, and you didn t freaking know. But I knew!  
KEVIN: Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter. 
KEVIN: Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it. 
KEVIN: Yes! Okay.  
KEVIN: Yes! That's what I'm talking about. 
KEVIN: Yes! Wait, why? 
KEVIN: Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo! 
KEVIN: Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me. 
KEVIN: Yes, we did it! 
KEVIN: Yes, well done! 
KEVIN: Yes, you are right. Forgive me. 
KEVIN: Yes. 
KEVIN: Yes.

KEVIN: Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist. 
KEVIN: Yes. Me do. 
KEVIN: Yes. She has bigger breasts, too. 
KEVIN: You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good.  
KEVIN: You are never going to find them. 
KEVIN: You aren't curious? 
KEVIN: You cannot make me run. 
KEVIN: You could put a banana in it. 
KEVIN: You did it, man.   Day one. Congrats. 
KEVIN: You did it. 
KEVIN: You didn't run for me... 
KEVIN: You do that on TV! 
KEVIN: You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face!  Yes! 
KEVIN: You don't know that. 
KEVIN: You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike! 
KEVIN: You got outdoors time? 
KEVIN: You guys are throwing a lot at me. 
KEVIN: You had me at "Sex." 
KEVIN: You have a penis? 
KEVIN: You keep think that. 
KEVIN: You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank... 
KEVIN: You know what Angela? I- Oh my god.  
KEVIN: You know. 
KEVIN: You love your mom. 
KEVIN: You mean where my desk is? 
KEVIN: You never call back. 
KEVIN: You own a bar? 
KEVIN: You re just saying that to make me feel better. 
KEVIN: You re not getting this, Peter. Make it go wider... up! 
KEVIN: You said it would be ready by today. And it is today. 
KEVIN: You said she liked me. 
KEVIN: You should go to Hedonism. 
KEVIN: You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth? 
KEVIN: You too. 
KEVIN: You wanna get high? 
KEVIN: You wanna go to the beach? 
KEVIN: You wanna play with the cactus? 
KEVIN: You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby. 
KEVIN: You were super mean. 
KEVIN: You weren't here for that. 
KEVIN: You would. 
KEVIN: Your call is very important to us. Ple-  
KEVIN: Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis. 
KEVIN: Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog. 
KEVIN: You're eating eight year old tomatoes? 
KEVIN: You're in here. 
KEVIN: You're wearing a woman's suit? 
KEVIN: You're welcome! 
KEVIN: You've got to be kidding! 
KEVIN: Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car? 
KEVIN:: That sounds great. 
KID: A fairy princess. 
KID: He seems bad at this. 
KID: I wanna go on it again. 
KID: I'm a bumble bee. 
KID: I'm a lion. 
KID: Thanks.  
KID: What is this company? 
KIDS:  I do, I do! 
KIDS: Ewwww! 
KIDS: Ewwww! 
KIDS: No way. 
KIDS: YAY! 
KIDS: Yeah! 
KIDS: Yeah!  
LADY:  Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away. 
LADY: Apologize. 
LADY: Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice? 
LADY: God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye. 
LADY: Good morning. 
LADY: How much for the slip and slide? 
LADY: It s okay. I ll go to the Costco and search for handsome men. 
LADY: Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat? 
LADY: Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking. 
LADY: Ohh... 
LADY: Okay.  
LADY: Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him! 
LADY: Well... 
LADY: What about the lady you hit with the pine cone? 
LADY: You know what? Tiffy s going to college. 
LAUREN:  Andy! Hey, what are you doing here? 
LAUREN:  Suck it!  
LAUREN: And we come to Matthew. The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together.  
LAUREN: Aww!  
LAUREN: Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me?  Yeah, run away! 
LAUREN: I can't believe you're not gay!  
LAUREN: Nice to meet you.  Well, Jess went out for a run but she'll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy's here! 
LAUREN: Oh, Jess!  Look who stopped by after his business trip! 
LAUREN: Oh. God. 
LAUREN: Well, I know. Look at me. 
LAUREN: You're done! 
LAURIE: After you, Mr. Scott. 
LAURIE: I'm Laurie. 
LAURIE: Mr. Scott? 
LAURIE: Ok. If you just want to follow me I'll take you up to the lounge. 
LAURIE: Thank you for joining us. Come with me. 
LAWYER: Are we talking about your grandchildren? 
LAWYER: Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix-- 
LAWYER: Did you shout, "Fire!", causing a panic? 
LAWYER: Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor. 
LAWYER: Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button. 
LAWYER: I don't follow this exactly. Uh, "The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have..." Dwight and 
LAWYER: Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else. 
LAWYER: Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution. 
LAWYER: Look, I don't think that's actually legal. 
LAWYER: So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000. 
LAWYER: This is essentially... 
LAWYER: Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract. 
LAWYER: Wh--what? 
LEFEVRE: Hey, Mr. Scott. 
LEFEVRE: It's about $1,000. 
LEFEVRE: No, $1,000 each year. 
LEFEVRE: Okay. Okay. Make it out to my mom, Rosa. 
LEFEVRE: That was messed up what you did. 
LEFEVRE: There were a lot of times over the years where I was pressured to get into the drug game. But I always thought back to my guardian angel, and the gift that you gave me. So I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to go to college, educate myself, and become the next President Obama. 
LEFEVRE: They're expensive. 
LEFEVRE: Who does something like that? Who promises that to a bunch of kids and then just doesn't come through like that? 
LEFEVRE: You came into our lives and made a promise, made us honest, made us realize, we don't need to compromise, cause we can have it all! Cause you made it possible, for us to achieve the improbable! 
LEFEVRE: You can pay for my college. 
LEFEVRE: You owe this to us! 
LEO: Walk away. Vance Refrigeration 
LEO: What makes you think we'd have weed? 
LEO: Why would you even say that? Vance Refrigeration 
LESTER: 
LESTER: A good start. And I think it's busload. 
LESTER: And you were directly under her the entire time? 
LESTER: Aren't we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not Michael and this Ryan person. 
LESTER: Can you be more specific? Who are the twins? 
LESTER: Can you go back to where this digression began? Deposition 
LESTER: Could we take a short break? 
LESTER: Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired? 
LESTER: Excuse me? 
LESTER: How long have you known Ms. Levinson? 
LESTER: How long have you known the plaintiff? 
LESTER: I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees? 
LESTER: Interesting. How so? 
LESTER: Irie, sorry. "More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael." It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct? Diane 
LESTER: Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination? 
LESTER: Ms. Levinson told you she was your direct superior? 
LESTER: Oh, are you sure? 
LESTER: Oh. Very good. Well put. 
LESTER: She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery? 
LESTER: Starting at paragraph 6. 
LESTER: This is plaintiff's exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year. "Just got back from Jamaica. Tan almost everywhere. Jan almost everywhere. Hehe. Oh diary, what a week. I had sex with my boss. I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere, that it was a one time mistake. But we had sex six times so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie." 
LESTER: Wait, we'd like to enter to the record a page from Michael Scott's personal journal. 
LESTER: What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination? 
LESTER: With all due respect, I'm in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position. 
LESTER: You can respond, just remember it's all going into the record. 
LESTER: You don't need to go any further. Her breasts. 
LEVEL: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.

LILY:   I'm in here. 
LILY:   Sam, Sam Sam. It's not that you dumped my granddaughter, and its not that you want children. It, it's that you lied to me. Can't you see that? Can't you see? Oh, I can never trust you.   
LILY: Get that done already. 
LILY: I want you to stay. 
LILY: Mmmhmm... Jessica

LIPTON: God, it s just so good to see you. 
LIPTON: Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody. 
LIPTON: Hey. 
LIPTON: Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op. 
LIPTON: I guess we're okay with the fingernails. 
LIPTON: I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second. 
LIPTON: Mmm. 
LIPTON: Nice to see you Oscar. 
LIPTON: No, no, no, he's nine pounds, seven ounces.

LIPTON: So Oscar, you re a dinosaur. 
LIPTON: Still. Still. 
LIPTON: Sure. 
LIPTON: Thanks. 
LIPTON: Well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you hit it out of the park. 
LIPTON: Well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton. 
LIPTON: Yes, he's substantial. 
LIPTON: You didn't call. 
LIPTON: You know what this is about.  Call.
LIPTON: You're stinky. 
LIPTOP: I just had a little intuition that someone I loved needed a little bit of attention today. Oscar, you're looking very healthy. Getting lots of vigorous exercise?  
LIPTOP: Well, thanks everybody. 
LIPTOP: What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't mean any offense. I was just trying to be friendly. 
LISTEN: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt.

LONNY: What the hell is wrong with this man? 
LONNY: What's up? 
LONNY: Yeah, but ours was real, Michael. 
LONNY: Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires. 
LONNY: Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it? 
LONNY: Yeah, yeah. That's, that's fat butt disease. That's what you suffer from? 
LONNY: Yeah? I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you? 
LONNY: You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us? 
LONNY: You're not allowed to drive the forklift.

LUKE: So you just want me to move it? You're being totally unclear here. I'm just gonna go ahead and move it.  
LUKE: Uh, if you asked me to do it, I'm sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe.

MAGICIAN: Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh? 
MAGICIAN: But I never could seem to figure out those knots. 
MAGICIAN: Huh! 
MAGICIAN: Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory. 
MAGICIAN: Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck?  You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya? 
MAGICIAN: Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for... birds.  All right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is... I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is. 
MAGICIAN: So we've established-

MAN: I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions? 
MAN: If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second.

MARGARET: I'm gonna head out. 
MARGARET: Michael? 
MARGARET: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm supposed to be meeting someone named Michael. 
MARGARET: She's beautiful. 
MARGARET: That's incredibly rude. 
MARGARET: You're asking what I do with the checks that people write to me?

MARIE: I am so tired. 
MARIE: Mmm-hmmm... 
MARIE: Oscar. 
MARIE: Thank you. 
MARIE: Thank you? 
MARIE: Uh...A stro cleaners on St. Johns place is the only place open on that day. 
MARK:  What if Bob Dylan was your boss? I'm gonna do Dylan!  Pam Halpert is my name, and I've been at Dunder Mifflin for seven years? Eight years? Eight years, man. Got the Dunder Mifflin blues. Got the Pam Halpert blues. Got the pra- went to the Pratt Institute...You have children? 
MARK: ... talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting...Is that her? Hey guys! Say something. 
MARK: But we already know each other's names. 
MARK: Don't be afraid, it's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone- 
MARK: Hey, I love the Birkenstocks. 
MARK: Hey, you must be Dwight! 
MARK: Hi, I'm Mark. 
MARK: I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant. 
MARK: I'm the horrible boss around here, but please don't hire Jamie Foxx to kill me. D'Jango! I don't agree with the use of the  N  word in that movie. It's, it's too soon. 
MARK: It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again. 
MARK: My aunt Joan. Oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before I did, so there's no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you I'm probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Ah, cute. Not work on this...work on this months. Ok Nana? Uh, when I say  Chillax  people chillax. Watch this. Hey Roger, chillax! Must not have heard me. 
MARK: Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don't- not allowed to ask. So... 
MARK: Oh, hi. They call me Marky Mark around here, because here at Simon Realty, we are one funky bunch! Come on you guys, raise the roof when I say that! I- what are you all temps again today? Let's go, Gangnam style.  He's heard Gangnam style, he knows it. Right? That's cause he's American. This is Carl. Uh, he's from here. Our neck of the woods. But Gangnam style is great, isn't it? 
MARK: Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition!  Kids in the Hall. Just, it's not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers. 
MARK: This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom.  From The Smurfs movie. 
MARK: This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok? 
MARK: Unlike some of these people around here. 
MARK: Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted. 
MARK: What does this say here? To ti te per tat... what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it. 
MARK: Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show? 
MARK: Yeah, we don't have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume and here's why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah. You don't jump ship easily. Like a lot of these people. I mean they worship me you know? But do they like me? I mean...you think they like me, Pam? 
MARK: Yes. 
MARK: You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that's just being Pam. Well I'm kinda cute and I'm- but I'm married so...leave that be. 
MARK: You're a good audience.  
MARK: You're not. 
MARTIN:  What's up with this guy? 
MARTIN: ...which is why they need a passing game. 
MARTIN: Actually, our TV was bigger than that one. 
MARTIN: Good. Getting settled, you know? 
MARTIN: Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire? 
MARTIN: Is he always like this? 
MARTIN: Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michael's office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time's our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes. 
MARTIN: Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time. 
MARTIN: Oh! Thanks. 
MARTIN: So... you all wanna know what I was in for? 
MARTIN: They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business. 
MARTIN: Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games... 
MARTIN: Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink. 
MARTIN: Yeah, in the rec room. 
MARTIN: Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison. 
MARTIN: Yeap. Yeah. 
MARY-BETH: Great.  La la la la la laaa... 
MARY-BETH: How do I get to Bernie's Tavern from here? 
MARY-BETH: I am-

MATT: I don't think so. 
MATT: I had some. 
MATT: It's Matt. 
MATT: Let's do it. 
MATT: Nice to meet you Oscar. 
MAURIE:  I learned that a company can describe their internship as "full of exciting experiences," even if that's a lie. There's no regulation. 
MAURIE: At Tink's? 
MAURIE: Did Stanley tell you? 
MAURIE: He was with somebody. 
MAURIE: How'd you know about that? 
MAURIE: I learned that if you look even the tiniest bit like Jet Li, Michael will call you "Jet Li" all summer. 
MAURIE: No, Stanley was with his wife. I waved at him, but he didn't wave back. 
MAURIE: No. 
MAURIE: What are you talking about?

MEGAN: I thought it was 500. 
MEGAN: No, really.  Where's my Andy? 
MEGAN: Oh. Hello. Hey everybody, look who's here. 
MEGAN: That's not like you. That's not like you. Come on, sing! Sing! 
MEGAN: Why the hell did you come back here? 
MEGAN: You are one of the good ones, nard dog. 
MELISSA: Come on!  You have an email address?

MELVINA: Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I ve been double-parked for five hours. I m wondering if I should move my car. 
MELVINA: Well, the joke s on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas. 
MELVINA: You went to X-Men school too?  
MEMA: I don't know what happened to it. 
MEMA: I should have known. The hotels television set had a movie on called "Bruno" last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, I couldn't turn it off. So I had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, 'How could they pick such a hotel?' Hmmm. Now I know. 
MEMA: I want to go to bed but I can't. I can't turn that television off. 
MEMA: I wasn't sure about your branch of the family. After I heard about your parent's divorce. But you and Jim are just perfect. God bless you. 
MEMA: It was that horrible Charlie Rose. 
MEMA: Oh. Thank you. 
MEMA: Oh. You're that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse. 
MEMA: People are like cats and dogs these days. 
MEMA: They were living together? 
MEMA: This used to be such a great country.

MEREDITH: How does one get a point? 
MEREDITH: How much? 
MEREDITH: Hurry up already.

MEREDITH: I am fine. 
MEREDITH: I am not an alcoholic! 
MEREDITH: I am not going in there! NO!! 
MEREDITH: I am so pissed at this company! 
MEREDITH: I am... 
MEREDITH: I ask... everyone in the room, "Are you in a relationship?". 
MEREDITH: I call loser! 
MEREDITH: I can't believe he has a second job. 
MEREDITH: I can't eat dairy. 
MEREDITH: I d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn t for the cameras, I would ve done some truly vulgar crap. 
MEREDITH: I didn't want you it! 
MEREDITH: I don't care what everyone thinks. I know I am not an alcoholic. 
MEREDITH: I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight or something-- 
MEREDITH: I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction. I do. To porn. 
MEREDITH: I don't remember doing that. 
MEREDITH: I don't remember. 
MEREDITH: I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing. 
MEREDITH: I don't want to say it out loud. 
MEREDITH: I don't want to! 
MEREDITH: I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college. Woman 
MEREDITH: I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter. 
MEREDITH: I got some in my minivan somewhere. 
MEREDITH: I gotta go. 
MEREDITH: I gotta see that little bitch. 
MEREDITH: I have a lot of work to do. 
MEREDITH: I have a shirt like that in my car. 
MEREDITH: I have no idea. 
MEREDITH: I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You re not alone sister. Let s get a beer sometime. 
MEREDITH: I just like the way it feels. 
MEREDITH: I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties. 
MEREDITH: I knew something bad was gonna happen today. 
MEREDITH: I know I drink. I like to party 
MEREDITH: I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop. 
MEREDITH: I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is. 
MEREDITH: I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing. 
MEREDITH: I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. 
MEREDITH: I like her fingernails. 
MEREDITH: I like her nails. 
MEREDITH: I love camping.  Anything can happen. 
MEREDITH: I never thanked you for coming to the hospital. 
MEREDITH: I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do?  
MEREDITH: I really prefer devils food cake. 
MEREDITH: I really want the iPod. 
MEREDITH: I really want to come out! 
MEREDITH: I think it looks good. 
MEREDITH: I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding. 
MEREDITH: I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front. 
MEREDITH: If I ever get that bad, you d tell me, right? 
MEREDITH: I'll go. Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill? 
MEREDITH: I'll help.   Now it's just a stupid baby. 
MEREDITH: I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs. I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you. 
MEREDITH: I'll smoke with you. I got a bag of cigars in my purse. 
MEREDITH: I'll take the oven mitt. 
MEREDITH: I'll take the teapot. 
MEREDITH: I'll take them for my kid. 
MEREDITH: I'm a hobo. 
MEREDITH: I'm all right. I'm all right. 
MEREDITH: I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around. 
MEREDITH: I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore. 
MEREDITH: I'm not an alcoholic. 
MEREDITH: I'm not gonna grow a third arm! 
MEREDITH: I'm not sorry about it. Todd 
MEREDITH: I'm so busted! Walk of shame! 
MEREDITH: I'm sorry.  You're here to sell me some paper. 
MEREDITH: In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober. 
MEREDITH: Is that a threat? 
MEREDITH: Is there anybody else. 
MEREDITH: Is there still something there? 
MEREDITH: It didn't get torn off? 
MEREDITH: It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot. 
MEREDITH: It's casual day. Happy?   
MEREDITH: It's coming off anyway. 
MEREDITH: It's just a van. 
MEREDITH: It's my valuables! 
MEREDITH: It's no problem. You live right near me. 
MEREDITH: It's not a big deal. 
MEREDITH: It's stupid. 
MEREDITH: I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder. 
MEREDITH: Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you. 
MEREDITH: Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that. 
MEREDITH: Jim.  
MEREDITH: Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish. 
MEREDITH: Just relax. Okay. 
MEREDITH: Just? Just what? Just forgot? 
MEREDITH: Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body. 
MEREDITH: Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County... 
MEREDITH: Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer. 
MEREDITH: Let me out! 
MEREDITH: Liaisons, you mean meet-ups? I don't know, once a month for six years. Something like that. 
MEREDITH: Like Clooney. 
MEREDITH: Little Ms. Thing wants attention. 
MEREDITH: Look, I know my way around a van. That is just a van. 
MEREDITH: Looks good. 
MEREDITH: Lose weight. 
MEREDITH: Make them kiss me.   
MEREDITH: Man, he s really in twinkle town now. 
MEREDITH: Maybe it wasn't. 
MEREDITH: Maybe we re s posed to do it with people in our group. 
MEREDITH: Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances. 
MEREDITH: Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans. 
MEREDITH: Me. Captain 
MEREDITH: Me. Please. 
MEREDITH: Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover? 
MEREDITH: Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you. 
MEREDITH: Michael, I'm not gonna do that. 
MEREDITH: Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget. 
MEREDITH: Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo? 
MEREDITH: Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said "Gross"... 
MEREDITH: More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories. 
MEREDITH: My car, my rules. 
MEREDITH: My kid didn t have a face tattoo. 
MEREDITH: My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?! 
MEREDITH: Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl. 
MEREDITH: Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper. There's not a lot of fruit in those looms. 
MEREDITH: Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier. 
MEREDITH: Niagara Falls in October? Pfft, hells yeah. 
MEREDITH: Nice accent. You sound like Forrest Gump. 
MEREDITH: Nice job. 
MEREDITH: No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in. 
MEREDITH: No duh. Let's go. You're buying. 
MEREDITH: No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful. 
MEREDITH: No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her. 
MEREDITH: No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins.  Let me fix you breakfast! 
MEREDITH: No thanks. They're too sweet. 
MEREDITH: No way! No way! There is no way!

MEREDITH: No, I get it. 
MEREDITH: No, I... I get it. It's funny.

MEREDITH: No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read. 
MEREDITH: Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today! 
MEREDITH: Not yet! 
MEREDITH: Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say,  Talk classy, act nasty . 
MEREDITH: Nothing. 
MEREDITH: Obviously. 
MEREDITH: Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt  Oh, yeah... I packed it in my purse. 
MEREDITH: Oh my! 
MEREDITH: Oh OOOH!

MEREDITH: Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying? 
MEREDITH: Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding. 
MEREDITH: Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl. 
MEREDITH: Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English. 
MEREDITH: Oh, that's part of my dream too. 
MEREDITH: Oh, that's what they call it.

MEREDITH: We can drink? 
MEREDITH: We have. 
MEREDITH: We just missed Poor Richards. 
MEREDITH: Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine? 
MEREDITH: Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates. 
MEREDITH: Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet. 
MEREDITH: Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer! 
MEREDITH: Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office. 
MEREDITH: Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut. 
MEREDITH: Well, it must have just opened up. 
MEREDITH: Well... I'm not quitting. 
MEREDITH: We're both girls. Who cares? 
MEREDITH: We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing. 
MEREDITH: What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? 
MEREDITH: What do we get if we do 'em? 
MEREDITH: What do you mean? 
MEREDITH: What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.

MEREDITH: When are you gonna boom me? 
MEREDITH: Where are we? This ain't my street.

MEREDITH: Where'd you get that salad? 
MEREDITH: Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour. 
MEREDITH: Who was messing with my van? 
MEREDITH: Whoa! 
MEREDITH: Whoa! My stuff! 
MEREDITH: Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What is the etiquette on taking the gifts? Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing? 
MEREDITH: Whoo-hoo. Let s get this party started! 
MEREDITH: Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam. 
MEREDITH: Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours. 
MEREDITH: Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it? 
MEREDITH: Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it. 
MEREDITH: Why? 
MEREDITH: Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood? 
MEREDITH: Wow! 
MEREDITH: Wow! 
MEREDITH: Wow, so this building can get uglier. 
MEREDITH: Wow. 
MEREDITH: Wow.

MEREDITH: Yeah! Man in! 
MEREDITH: Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83. 
MEREDITH: Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat. 
MEREDITH: Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed. 
MEREDITH: Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink? 
MEREDITH: Yeah, it makes me sick. 
MEREDITH: Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences. 
MEREDITH: Yeah, my neighbor got murdered. 
MEREDITH: Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage? 
MEREDITH: Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.

MEREDITH: Yes. 
MEREDITH: Yes. 
MEREDITH: Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head. 
MEREDITH: You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three. 
MEREDITH: You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts. 
MEREDITH: You can take my van! 
MEREDITH: You comin'? 
MEREDITH: You cracked my pelvis

MEREDITH: You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot. 
MEREDITH: You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice. 
MEREDITH: You have to go, Toby. 
MEREDITH: You have to!  
MEREDITH: You hit me with your car! 
MEREDITH: You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home. 
MEREDITH: You know it. I am never getting married. 
MEREDITH: You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said. 
MEREDITH: You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like.  
MEREDITH: You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life.  
MEREDITH: You smell like a Scorpio.  This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro. 
MEREDITH: You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn t fart on a butterfly. 
MEREDITH: You're not forgiven. 
MEREDITH: You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct... 
MEREDITH: You're right. You're right. Yes. 
MEREDITH: You're the closest one to it. 
MEREDITH: You're welcome. 
MEREDITH: Yup, just a cold sore. 
MERIDITH: Drama Queen? 
MERIDITH: Hey, back off. It's Solitare. 
MERV:  I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really.  You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there.  
MERV:  Wait. 
MERV:  Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... I'm gonna die here. 
MERV: Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today. 
MERV: I'm having a bad time.  
MERV: Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met. 
MERV: Place must be horrible. I don't know if I want this job.  
MERV: Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office. 
MERV: What do you mean? 
MERV: You guys pay for relocation, though, right?

MICHAEL:   Don't do that. 
MICHAEL:   Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know. 
MICHAEL:   Dwight, are you talking about us? 
MICHAEL:   Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott. Good to see you again. 
MICHAEL:   Hahaha!... well... 
MICHAEL:   Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so-- 
MICHAEL:   Hello, good morning. 
MICHAEL:   Hello, I am here for the small business seminar. 
MICHAEL:   Hello, may I help you? 
MICHAEL:   Help!! Help!! 
MICHAEL:   Hey! 
MICHAEL:   Hey, hey!   Pam, Pam! Hey! 
MICHAEL:   Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them. 
MICHAEL:   Hey, is that healthy food? 
MICHAEL:   Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them-   
MICHAEL:   Hey, what say we order up some pasta? 
MICHAEL:   Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies. 
MICHAEL:   Hi. 
MICHAEL:   Hmm? 
MICHAEL:   How can he still not know? 
MICHAEL:   I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse. 
MICHAEL:   I guess not. 
MICHAEL:   I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened.  This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the "Don't Go in There After Me" award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So... 
MICHAEL:   I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin. 
MICHAEL:   I quit. 
MICHAEL:   I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged. 
MICHAEL:   I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt. 
MICHAEL:   I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it? 
MICHAEL:   I... was just learning... to... love. 
MICHAEL:   I'll be down in a minute.   Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned? 
MICHAEL:   I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester. 
MICHAEL:   I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in. 
MICHAEL:   I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat! 
MICHAEL:   Is Mr. Schofield there? Automated phone 
MICHAEL:   Is this good? 
MICHAEL:   It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance. 
MICHAEL:   It is going to be the happiest day of my life.   
MICHAEL:   It's a pretty lame party. 
MICHAEL:   It's Michael Scott.   Hold it up. Conference room, five minutes. 
MICHAEL:   It's not ready yet. 
MICHAEL:   Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it. 
MICHAEL:   Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day. 
MICHAEL:   Kelly. 
MICHAEL:   Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the 
MICHAEL:   Lauren,   enough with the pencils. 
MICHAEL:   Lets do this! 
MICHAEL:   Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you? 
MICHAEL:   Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid... tan. No. 
MICHAEL:   Look what he's doing. 
MICHAEL:   Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks. 
MICHAEL:   Mmm--- mmm... Um... 
MICHAEL:   Mpfh. 
MICHAEL:   My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera. 
MICHAEL:   NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY.   
MICHAEL:   NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you...   This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't.   Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump? 
MICHAEL:   No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands. 
MICHAEL:   No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight. 
MICHAEL:   No, what I'm saying is... 
MICHAEL:   No. 
MICHAEL:   Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn. Mr. 
MICHAEL:   Oh my God, how long was I out?   
MICHAEL:   Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do?   What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight?   Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation. 
MICHAEL:   Oh my God. Is that Jim's? 
MICHAEL:   Oh, is somebody making fun of me? 
MICHAEL:   Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso. 
MICHAEL:   Oh, oh! 
MICHAEL:   Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India. 
MICHAEL:   Oh, thank you. 
MICHAEL:   Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at? 
MICHAEL:   Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody! 
MICHAEL:   Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me.   Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm... 
MICHAEL:   OK. 
MICHAEL:   Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy. 
MICHAEL:   Okay. 
MICHAEL:   Okay. 
MICHAEL:   Okay. 
MICHAEL:   Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so... 
MICHAEL:   See how it's done?   Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it.   See what I did? 
MICHAEL:   Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself. 
MICHAEL:   So how you holding up? 
MICHAEL:   So is this the meeting you've been in all day? 
MICHAEL:   So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.   Where you from? 
MICHAEL:   Stanley? 
MICHAEL:   --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party. 
MICHAEL:   There you are, my friend. 
MICHAEL:   This is nice. This is nice. Move in here. Very sweet... ah. 
MICHAEL:   This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration.   I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me.   Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it. 
MICHAEL:   Time to make the donuts.   Come on. Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again. Come on.   De-nied! 
MICHAEL:   To be married? 
MICHAEL:   Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets   because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine. 
MICHAEL:   Uh oh. What's so funny? 
MICHAEL:   Uh, it's a sketch now. 
MICHAEL:   Uh, yeah. 
MICHAEL:   Uh... Yes. 
MICHAEL:   Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa. 
MICHAEL:   We'll have to talk-- 
MICHAEL:   Well here we are... I would just like to... 
MICHAEL:   Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go.   Lion King! 
MICHAEL:   Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes.   Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV? 
MICHAEL:   What am I gong to do? Uh...  . 
MICHAEL:   What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I gonna stay up all day. Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO! And I'm going to stop worrying about calories. 
MICHAEL:   What are you doing? 
MICHAEL:   What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three,   you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory. 
MICHAEL:   What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it-- 
MICHAEL:   What was that? 
MICHAEL:   What? 
MICHAEL:   What's going on? 
MICHAEL:   Whoo. 
MICHAEL:   Who's there? 
MICHAEL:   Why? 
MICHAEL:   Wow. 
MICHAEL:   Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis! 
MICHAEL:   Yeah. 
MICHAEL:   Yes, you did. 
MICHAEL:   Yes. 
MICHAEL:   Yes? 
MICHAEL:   You have to agree with me.   That's insane. 
MICHAEL:   You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership. 
MICHAEL:   You think it's easy? 
MICHAEL:   You wanna go out? 
MICHAEL:   Your life.   Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue.   Oh, wow.   Ooh, okay. 
MICHAEL:  "Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'." 
MICHAEL:  "Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!"  
MICHAEL:  "I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs." Diane 
MICHAEL:  "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business." 
MICHAEL:  "I guess I missed you." I guess I missed you. So, she misses me? 
MICHAEL:  "In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute." 
MICHAEL:  "This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer."  "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone." 
MICHAEL:  "You have won a tiny Dundie." Guy at 
MICHAEL:  ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of... 
MICHAEL:  ...okay. 
MICHAEL:  ...since the world was turning. 
MICHAEL:  ...You can take a five, if you want. 
MICHAEL:  A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...  
MICHAEL:  A little over the top, don't you think? 
MICHAEL:  A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style. 
MICHAEL:  A statue. 
MICHAEL:  A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour. 
MICHAEL:  Acting! 
MICHAEL:  Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have... 
MICHAEL:  Ahhhhhhhhh.  I'm hungry. 
MICHAEL:  All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority. 
MICHAEL:  All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW! 
MICHAEL:  All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales! 
MICHAEL:  All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go. 
MICHAEL:  All right. 
MICHAEL:  All right.  
MICHAEL:  All right. Okay.  
MICHAEL:  Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on. 
MICHAEL:  Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip.  
MICHAEL:  Alright let's go!  This way, this way!  
MICHAEL:  Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band.  You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh? 
MICHAEL:  Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year. 
MICHAEL:  Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like? 
MICHAEL:  Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted. 
MICHAEL:  Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead. 
MICHAEL:  And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home.  
MICHAEL:  And if you want love, we'll make it. Swim in a big sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break 'em. This is bound to take awhile. Your body is a wonderland.  Your body is a wonderland. 
MICHAEL:  And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs. 
MICHAEL:  And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form. 
MICHAEL: - and to King Meredith!  
MICHAEL:  And you, why are you still here. 
MICHAEL:  Andy had Erin. 
MICHAEL:  Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. "Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all. 
MICHAEL:  Anybody want any coffee or... 
MICHAEL:  Are these numbers correct? 
MICHAEL:  Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police. 
MICHAEL:  Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the murderer is.  Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do? 
MICHAEL:  Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis. 
MICHAEL:  Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those.  Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go. 
MICHAEL:  Back to work.  Still waitin' on that coffee. 
MICHAEL:  Be my eyes. 
MICHAEL:  Beer me Billy. 
MICHAEL:  Beow! 
MICHAEL:  Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated. 
MICHAEL:  Bingo. 
MICHAEL:  Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera. 
MICHAEL:  Boo! Boo! 
MICHAEL:  Boom! Detective Michael Scarn. I'm with the FBI. 
MICHAEL:  Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek. 
MICHAEL:  Bummer. 
MICHAEL:  But it just may be a lunatic...  No. 
MICHAEL:  But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? 
MICHAEL:  Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off  and die? 
MICHAEL:  Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We're proud of you.  Bye. Okay. 
MICHAEL:  Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride. Man on 
MICHAEL:  Can I have a ride home? 
MICHAEL:  Can I sit here? 
MICHAEL:  Can I speak to you a minute? 
MICHAEL:  Can you get her? She's right there.  That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day.  Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers." Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael."  
MICHAEL:  Can you hear me, they talk about us... 
MICHAEL:  Can you hold down the fort?  Hey boo! 
MICHAEL:  Can't you? That's so nice. 
MICHAEL:  Catch you guys-  Catch you guys on the filippity flip.  Flippity flip!  Flippity flip!  Really?  Okay, see ya guys!  
MICHAEL:  Cherokee Jack. Cherokee 
MICHAEL:  Chili's baby back ribs... 
MICHAEL:  Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game. 
MICHAEL:  Clean up on aisle five.  
MICHAEL:  Come on. 
MICHAEL:  Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by! 
MICHAEL:  Con-- you look like a nerd. 
MICHAEL:  Congratulations! 
MICHAEL:  Congratulations. 
MICHAEL:  Could you...? 
MICHAEL:  Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you.   All, you have to close right now. 
MICHAEL:  Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please? Wendy's phone 
MICHAEL:  Damn it. 
MICHAEL:  Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving. Warehouse 
MICHAEL:  Darryl! 
MICHAEL:  David! 
MICHAEL:  Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about  2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources.  OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here... 
MICHAEL:  DeAngelo is expressing himself.  So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well... 
MICHAEL:  DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there! 
MICHAEL:  Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors? 
MICHAEL:  Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la.  'Tis the ... ack.  Hey!  I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint... 
MICHAEL:  Diane 
MICHAEL:  Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch. 
MICHAEL:  Did you hear Pam is pregnant? 
MICHAEL:  Did you hear Stanley's having an affair? 
MICHAEL:  Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred? 
MICHAEL:  Does anybody else know about this? 
MICHAEL:  D'oh! 
MICHAEL:  Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up? 
MICHAEL:  Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow. 
MICHAEL:  Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker. Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way. 
MICHAEL:  Don't know, don't care. 
MICHAEL:  Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter... 
MICHAEL:  Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities. 
MICHAEL:  Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel.  
MICHAEL:  Dwight. 
MICHAEL:  Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground.  
MICHAEL:  E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone? 
MICHAEL:  Eat it. 
MICHAEL:  Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin' back. 
MICHAEL:  ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.

MICHAEL:  Expenses. 
MICHAEL:  Fat Halpert.  Jim Halpert. 
MICHAEL:  Feels good. 
MICHAEL:  Fine. 
MICHAEL:  First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like - 
MICHAEL: - follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two.  
MICHAEL:  From the mall. That... 
MICHAEL:  Get out.  Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby. 
MICHAEL:  Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat! 
MICHAEL:  Go away. 
MICHAEL:  Go go go go go go! 
MICHAEL:  Go. 
MICHAEL:  God, yeah... Ah! This...

MICHAEL:  Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter. 
MICHAEL:  Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go. 
MICHAEL:  Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna... 
MICHAEL:  Happy Birthday! 
MICHAEL:  Happy Birthday! 
MICHAEL:  Happy Birthday! 
MICHAEL:  Have you ever seen this woman? 
MICHAEL:  Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?

MICHAEL:  Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven.  Heads.  Tails. ...Heads...Tails...Heads...Tails.  Well, it looks like there's going to be a clean-up on aisle five. 
MICHAEL:  Hello there.

MICHAEL:  Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland. 
MICHAEL:  Hey Toby! You suck!  
MICHAEL:  Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute? 
MICHAEL:  Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute.  Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess.  You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk.  Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?  I'm being serious. Seriously. 
MICHAEL:  Hey! 
MICHAEL:  Hey, David? 
MICHAEL:  Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.

MICHAEL:  Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you.  OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later. 
MICHAEL:  Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?

MICHAEL:  Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning.  I am going to be... kind of a daddy. 
MICHAEL:  Hi. 
MICHAEL:  Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North." And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace. 
MICHAEL:  Hmm... Jim?  I am downloading some N3P... 
MICHAEL:  Hmm... no. 
MICHAEL:  Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt! 
MICHAEL:  Holly Flax. 
MICHAEL:  How are you guys doing? Need anything? 
MICHAEL:  How are you? Good morning. Good morning. 
MICHAEL:  How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you. 
MICHAEL:  How are your sales doin'? 
MICHAEL:  How can you eat like that? 
MICHAEL:  How did she die? 
MICHAEL:  How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud.  Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision.  At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former. 
MICHAEL:  How do you know this? 
MICHAEL:  How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either. 
MICHAEL:  How long have you known about the pregnancy? Jim & 
MICHAEL:  How you doing? 
MICHAEL:  Huh! Thanks, downer. 
MICHAEL:  Hurry, please. 
MICHAEL:  I already have my European girlfriend. 
MICHAEL:  I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape. Um...  I can't stand it , I can't stay in here another second. No! 
MICHAEL:  I am declining to speak first. 
MICHAEL:  I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp. 
MICHAEL:  I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke. 
MICHAEL:  I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it.  
MICHAEL:  I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house. 
MICHAEL:  I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food. 
MICHAEL:  I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not...  Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls. 
MICHAEL:  I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this.  I still need something to drink out of though. 
MICHAEL:  I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there! 
MICHAEL:  I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk! 
MICHAEL:  I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote.  I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come.  
MICHAEL:  I can't help but feel partially responsible. 
MICHAEL:  I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up. 
MICHAEL:  I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case. 
MICHAEL:  I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again. 
MICHAEL:  I don't deserve this, guys. 
MICHAEL:  I don't get it! 
MICHAEL:  I don't know about that. 
MICHAEL:  I don't know what he's doing. 
MICHAEL:  I don't know. 
MICHAEL:  I don't know.  Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale.  Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile. 
MICHAEL:  I don't think I can sign this. Mr. 
MICHAEL: -- I don't think it is. 
MICHAEL:  I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it -  
MICHAEL:  I don't understand why you keep picking on me. 
MICHAEL:  I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day. 
MICHAEL:  I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids... 
MICHAEL:  I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It s every parent s dream. 
MICHAEL:  I hate you! 
MICHAEL:  I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful. 
MICHAEL:  I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection. 
MICHAEL:  I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it. 
MICHAEL:  I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home". 
MICHAEL:  I love you!  
MICHAEL:  I present the orientation video. 
MICHAEL:  I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron? 
MICHAEL:  I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom? 
MICHAEL:  I vouched for you. 
MICHAEL:  I want my baby back, baby back, baby back  Michael and 
MICHAEL:  I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator. 
MICHAEL:  I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you? 
MICHAEL:  I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here. 
MICHAEL:  I work with a bunch of nerds. 
MICHAEL:  If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family. 
MICHAEL:  If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos? 
MICHAEL:  I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack! 
MICHAEL:  I'll be over there. 
MICHAEL:  I'll get it! Man I love being retired! Scarn here! 
MICHAEL:  I'll have what she's having! 
MICHAEL:  I'll kill you. 
MICHAEL:  I'll take a shirt. 
MICHAEL:  I'm Facebook. 
MICHAEL:  I'm just worried about my friend. 
MICHAEL:  I'm not saying... a damn thing. 
MICHAEL:  I'm not the godfather. 
MICHAEL:  I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face. 
MICHAEL:  I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy. 
MICHAEL:  I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it. 
MICHAEL:  I'm up. 
MICHAEL:  I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here. 
MICHAEL:  Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly. 
MICHAEL:  It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper. 
MICHAEL:  It is done! 
MICHAEL:  It is? 
MICHAEL:  It looks like a  It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it!  He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody! 
MICHAEL:  It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on. 
MICHAEL:  It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream. 
MICHAEL:  It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye.  I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called "Curves." I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it! 
MICHAEL:  It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do.  Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go. 
MICHAEL:  I've never seen this place in the daylight. 
MICHAEL:  Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good. 
MICHAEL:  Jim where is Pam? 
MICHAEL:  Jim! Jim! Right here!  Ow! God! Hold it! 
MICHAEL:  Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby. 
MICHAEL:  Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.  ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different.  Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow. 
MICHAEL:  Just pretend we're not here. 
MICHAEL:  Just-in time. 
MICHAEL:  Kelly! Kelly? Kelly. 
MICHAEL:  Kelly, how are you? 
MICHAEL:  Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now. 
MICHAEL:  Lampshade on head! It's happening! 
MICHAEL:  Let's call him and get the website. 
MICHAEL:  Let's go. The men's room was disgusting. 
MICHAEL:  Let's look at this. 
MICHAEL:  Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger.  Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go.  
MICHAEL:  Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on. 
MICHAEL:  Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up? 
MICHAEL:  Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down. 
MICHAEL:  Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison. But we zoom back further--- Ad guy 
MICHAEL:  Little pick me up?  Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush. 
MICHAEL:  Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals. 
MICHAEL:  Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug. 
MICHAEL:  Look,  It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive. 
MICHAEL:  Makin' progress.  Yes? 
MICHAEL:  Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said "The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle." 
MICHAEL:  Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath. 
MICHAEL:  Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor. 
MICHAEL:  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho,  pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting? 
MICHAEL:  Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not. 
MICHAEL:  Mmhmm, China. China. 
MICHAEL:  Mmm, mm mm mm.  
MICHAEL:  Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on. 
MICHAEL:  Mmm... whoa. 
MICHAEL:  Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent. 
MICHAEL:  Morning everyone. 
MICHAEL:  Much advice you seek.  Do you know who that is? 
MICHAEL:  My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet. 
MICHAEL:  My girls. There they are.  
MICHAEL:  My life! Oh, my life... 
MICHAEL:  Narc! 
MICHAEL:  Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me. 
MICHAEL:  Nice! Come here!  
MICHAEL:  Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round. 
MICHAEL:  Night everyone. Night Pam, thanks again for the rum. 
MICHAEL:  No one wants to pick me up!? 
MICHAEL:  No way. 
MICHAEL:  No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man. 
MICHAEL:  No! 
MICHAEL:  No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me! 
MICHAEL:  No, damn it! 
MICHAEL:  No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me? 
MICHAEL:  No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle. 
MICHAEL:  No, no, no. 
MICHAEL:  No, not the five families. 
MICHAEL:  No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known. 
MICHAEL:  Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that. 
MICHAEL:  Not Michael, E.T. 
MICHAEL:  Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay porn, straight porn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful. 
MICHAEL:  Nothing. 
MICHAEL:  Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know. 
MICHAEL:  Nyeh, I work here.  Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day. 
MICHAEL:  Off the backboard! 
MICHAEL:  Officers. Thank you. 
MICHAEL:  Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man! 
MICHAEL:  Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch.  
MICHAEL:  Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm... 
MICHAEL:  Oh man, you should order milk. Get it? 
MICHAEL:  Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God. 
MICHAEL:  Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding? 
MICHAEL:  Oh shoot! That's my cab. 
MICHAEL:  Oh that feels better. 
MICHAEL:  Oh the rotating um, steam wand.  What? What's the matter? 
MICHAEL:  Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep. 
MICHAEL:  OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski? 
MICHAEL:  Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, Christ.

MICHAEL:  Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? "Oscar. I am the Count." Nailed him. Nailed him.  Good work Cookie Monster. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, shhh... Come on. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, that smells good. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, these do not taste like oysters. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, wow, that is adorable! 
MICHAEL:  Oh, wow. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, you startled me. My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest. What can I do you for? 
MICHAEL:  Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay. 
MICHAEL:  Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el! 
MICHAEL:  Ohh, I miss you. 
MICHAEL:  Ohh... 
MICHAEL:  Ohhh, God. 
MICHAEL:  OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul.

MICHAEL:  Ok, I'll just have the pudding. 
MICHAEL:  Ok, so I'm the guy at the station. 
MICHAEL:  OK. 
MICHAEL:  Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--

MICHAEL:  Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys... 
MICHAEL:  Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements. 
MICHAEL:  Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.

MICHAEL:  Right!  And I take that as a compliment. 
MICHAEL:  Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back. 
MICHAEL:  Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good. 
MICHAEL:  Ryan started the fire! It was always burning--- 
MICHAEL:  Ryan started the fire! It was always burning...

MICHAEL:  Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ...  ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we? 
MICHAEL:  Shave me.  This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies! 
MICHAEL:  She was once my girl, and she is your girl now. 
MICHAEL:  Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek!  I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry. 
MICHAEL:  Shut it.  Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight. 
MICHAEL:  Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please?  Uh, it's equal. 
MICHAEL: - since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right? 
MICHAEL:  Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect. 
MICHAEL:  Sit on floor and put together chair we will.  Yo-da. Um... 
MICHAEL:  Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'. 
MICHAEL:  Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour! 
MICHAEL:  So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles. 
MICHAEL:  So stupid! 
MICHAEL:  So who is the godfather? 
MICHAEL:  So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good, nice doing business with you. Thank you.  Yes!  Oh, yeah! Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that!  Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale!  
MICHAEL:  So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this... 
MICHAEL:  Some breakfast for me  and some breakfast for you.  
MICHAEL:  Something with a "K". 
MICHAEL:  Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now. 
MICHAEL:  Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well!  And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind.  
MICHAEL:  Sounds great. 
MICHAEL:  Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What? 
MICHAEL:  Stanley is having an affir. 
MICHAEL:  Stanley was on your group date? 
MICHAEL:  Stop it. Stop! What is that? 
MICHAEL:  Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real.  Stanley, are you having an affair? 
MICHAEL:  Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that. 
MICHAEL:  Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit. 
MICHAEL:  Take it back. 
MICHAEL:  Take that thing off the table! Please! 
MICHAEL:  Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping. 
MICHAEL:  Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf? 
MICHAEL:  Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette . Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady.  
MICHAEL:  Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok. 
MICHAEL:  Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts? 
MICHAEL:  That-- 
MICHAEL:  That and that are the same letter. 
MICHAEL:  That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are? 
MICHAEL:  That is awesome. 
MICHAEL:  That is me. Come on in.  Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?  
MICHAEL:  That should not be there. 
MICHAEL:  That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay. 
MICHAEL:  That was a very good point. 
MICHAEL:  That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up? 
MICHAEL:  That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet. 
MICHAEL:  That's ok.  
MICHAEL:  That's terrible. 
MICHAEL:  That's true. 
MICHAEL:  THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!  THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!  
MICHAEL:  That's what she said. 
MICHAEL:  That's what she said.  
MICHAEL:  The Dundie award for "Longest Engagement" goes to Pam Beesley. 
MICHAEL:  The Dundies! 
MICHAEL:  The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman... 
MICHAEL:  The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame. 
MICHAEL:  The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that... 
MICHAEL:  There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else. 
MICHAEL:  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick... 
MICHAEL:  There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed.  Michael Scott, as seen on TV. Todd 
MICHAEL:  There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it!  
MICHAEL:  There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!

MICHAEL:  There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny. 
MICHAEL:  There you go. 
MICHAEL:  There you go. 
MICHAEL:  There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day? 
MICHAEL:  They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do! Mr. 
MICHAEL:  They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving. 
MICHAEL:  They want how many spiral pads? 
MICHAEL:  This had better be terrible. 
MICHAEL:  This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist. 
MICHAEL:  This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points... 
MICHAEL:  This is Mike Tyson. 
MICHAEL:  This is not as much fun as I thought it would be. 
MICHAEL:  This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons. 
MICHAEL:  This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with..  Holly Flax, marrying me will you be? 
MICHAEL:  This one's for you Cherokee Jack.  
MICHAEL:  Those girls really wailed on you bad. 
MICHAEL:  To Oscar Martinez it's the "Show Me the Money" award! Yeah! 
MICHAEL:  Toby, just do it! God! 
MICHAEL:  Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow. 
MICHAEL:  Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it.  Let's try this. Put these on.  I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't-  That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this,  and make it sound perfect. 
MICHAEL:  Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar. 
MICHAEL:  T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert.  You started with this company, as a fine young man... 
MICHAEL:  Ugh. 
MICHAEL:  Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now. I will... I love you too. Bye. 
MICHAEL:  Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit? 
MICHAEL:  Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little "Good Will Hunting" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind. 
MICHAEL:  Uhm... 
MICHAEL:  Um, Pam. 
MICHAEL:  Um, um, um... 
MICHAEL:  Um... kay. Uh, alright. 
MICHAEL:  Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart. 
MICHAEL:  Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again. 
MICHAEL:  Ummm... Hm... No.  No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in.  Oh hi everybody, it's Ping!  And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful!  I ruv you all! I ruv you very much! 
MICHAEL:  Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it. 
MICHAEL:  Watch the long passes, you guys! 
MICHAEL:  We are in a stairwell. 
MICHAEL:  We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions? 
MICHAEL:  Well I will turn up the volume. 
MICHAEL:  Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way.  You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!  You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! Todd 
MICHAEL:  Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it! 
MICHAEL:  Well that's a... pretty good reaction.  Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that? 
MICHAEL:  Well then... I am glad you're ok. 
MICHAEL:  Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything.  
MICHAEL:  Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap. 
MICHAEL:  Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh!  This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest.  That's what she said!  
MICHAEL:  Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard. 
MICHAEL:  Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude. 
MICHAEL:  Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody! 
MICHAEL:  Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest! 
MICHAEL:  Well, thank you... thank you a lot. And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops. 
MICHAEL:  Well, well, well. What is this contraption, I do declare? 
MICHAEL:  Well... 
MICHAEL:  We're going bankrupt, you think?  They are really angry. 
MICHAEL:  Were they in the missionary position?  
MICHAEL:  What are you wearing? Who's Pat? 
MICHAEL:  What do you mean hmm-um? Pizza 
MICHAEL:  What do you think? I spent all morning on it. 
MICHAEL:  What do you want to do for dinner? 
MICHAEL:  What do you want? 
MICHAEL:  What does that look like to you? 
MICHAEL:  What happened? 
MICHAEL:  What is she so upset about? 
MICHAEL:  What is wrong with me today?! 
MICHAEL:  What the hell are they talking about? 
MICHAEL:  What you want a cookie? Mr. 
MICHAEL:  What? 
MICHAEL:  What? 
MICHAEL:  What? 
MICHAEL:  What? 
MICHAEL:  What? Oh my God!  There has been a murder. There's been a murder in Savannah.  
MICHAEL:  What? There was someone left off that list? Who? 
MICHAEL:  What? Was I not supposed to say it?  What? Turn it back on. 
MICHAEL:  What's it... why are you crying? 
MICHAEL:  What's the dealio? 
MICHAEL:  When have you ever done that? 
MICHAEL:  When I let him come to my pick-up game... 
MICHAEL:  Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there. 
MICHAEL:  Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay. 
MICHAEL:  Which one is that again? 
MICHAEL:  Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah. 
MICHAEL:  Who's getting married? 
MICHAEL:  Who's playing with the button? 
MICHAEL:  Why don't you just leave? Okay? 
MICHAEL:  Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. God. Can't I get a little privacy? Hotel 
MICHAEL:  Why hello! 
MICHAEL:  Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh? 
MICHAEL:  Why? 
MICHAEL:  Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton? 
MICHAEL:  Word.  There we go. Let's see it. 
MICHAEL:  Would you excuse us... 
MICHAEL:  Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire. 
MICHAEL:  Wow, this is tough. 
MICHAEL:  Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps? Larry 
MICHAEL:  Wow. Oh, wow, that was close. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah ... 
MICHAEL:  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score? 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get? 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good.  
MICHAEL:  Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God! 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, okay.  Well this is gonna hurt like a mother. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, Randy Newman's the best. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see? 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, well, at least he was married. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers.  I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them - Fourth 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah. That would be perfect. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah... 
MICHAEL:  Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya? 
MICHAEL:  Yeah? 
MICHAEL:  Yeah? 
MICHAEL:  Yeah? 
MICHAEL:  Yeah? 
MICHAEL:  Yes 
MICHAEL:  Yes! 
MICHAEL:  Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms. 
MICHAEL:  Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look? 
MICHAEL:  Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you. 
MICHAEL:  Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive... 
MICHAEL:  Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger.  All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake.  That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so...  So that's the way it's done. 
MICHAEL:  Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair. 
MICHAEL:  Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four.  And I have said goodbye to half of them. 
MICHAEL:  Yes.  Yes my hero! 
MICHAEL:  Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting? 
MICHAEL:  Yes. Todd 
MICHAEL:  Yes. Well... we can...  uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright.  Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name? 
MICHAEL:  You ahh. 
MICHAEL:  You ahh. 
MICHAEL:  You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke! 
MICHAEL:  You been X'd punk!  Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you. 
MICHAEL:  You can count on me. 
MICHAEL:  You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right? 
MICHAEL:  You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread? 
MICHAEL:  You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it. 
MICHAEL:  You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word. 
MICHAEL:  You just press the button. 
MICHAEL:  You just twist your hand until something breaks. 
MICHAEL:  You know your I.D. says you're a security threat? 
MICHAEL:  You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well. 
MICHAEL:  You make a very compelling argument. 
MICHAEL:  You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up. 
MICHAEL:  You sure you're OK? 
MICHAEL:  You were laughing right? 
MICHAEL:  You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by...  and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well... 
MICHAEL:  You'll never guess what I know. 
MICHAEL:  You're a good, good guy. 
MICHAEL:  You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, 
MICHAEL:  You're welcome, baby. 
MICHAEL:  You've changed, man. 
MICHAEL:  Yum! Yum yum yum!  That's delicious! I love it! 
MICHAEL: "Bend It Like Beckham." 
MICHAEL: "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." 
MICHAEL: "Don't sl-", ok, that's blank  Don't, just put it- 
MICHAEL: "Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that." 
MICHAEL: "He's up there." 
MICHAEL: "I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, "Mr. Brown," he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears. 
MICHAEL: "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." Open-mindedness, is that even a word? "...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck."  He's going to lose it when he reads that. 
MICHAEL: "It's fun to stay at the -" 
MICHAEL: "It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!" 
MICHAEL: "Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special. 
MICHAEL: "She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her." 
MICHAEL: "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello."  Card! 
MICHAEL: "Why are you helping her? You're not even dating." She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh... 
MICHAEL: "You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"  
MICHAEL: $645. 
MICHAEL: ...   It's a million-dollar sale. 
MICHAEL: ... and I feel free! 
MICHAEL: ... and... we had sex, too. 
MICHAEL: ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us . 
MICHAEL: ... he cried at the end of it. He did. 
MICHAEL: ... I asked for trick candles. 
MICHAEL: ... Oh, God is that today? 
MICHAEL: ... Okay. 
MICHAEL: ... proud. 
MICHAEL: ... with coffee but without the haunted. 
MICHAEL: ...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere... 
MICHAEL: ...Absolutely not. 
MICHAEL: ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me! 
MICHAEL: ...And products! 
MICHAEL: ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that. 
MICHAEL: ...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival. 
MICHAEL: ...awesome. 
MICHAEL: ...between us. 
MICHAEL: ...business meeting -- 
MICHAEL: ...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok. 
MICHAEL: ...calendar. 
MICHAEL: ...Chunky. Do you want half? 
MICHAEL: ...come on, Jan!  
MICHAEL: ...Danny Glover.  Yeah. 
MICHAEL: ...empathy, respect...  Jim! Jim! 
MICHAEL: ...for Phone. What? 
MICHAEL: ...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water. 
MICHAEL: ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye. 
MICHAEL: ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back. Business Student 
MICHAEL: ...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.  
MICHAEL: ...in order to feed the bears. 
MICHAEL: ...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging. 
MICHAEL: ...it happens once every billion years. 
MICHAEL: ...Jan. Kay. 
MICHAEL: ...Jim. 
MICHAEL: ...kind of   Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something. 
MICHAEL: ...know if you showed me this same unit or not. 
MICHAEL: ...Like a tip?   $645?! 
MICHAEL: ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession? 
MICHAEL: ...Or biologically. 
MICHAEL: ...poop my pants. 
MICHAEL: ...R-P-E-E-S 
MICHAEL: ...Stanley? 
MICHAEL: ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas. 
MICHAEL: ...the "Busiest Beaver" award goes to Phyllis Lapin.  
MICHAEL: ...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right? 
MICHAEL: ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan. 
MICHAEL: ...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life. 
MICHAEL: ...uh, no. 
MICHAEL: ...Wait, Ryan said that? 
MICHAEL: ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot. 
MICHAEL: ...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid. Business Student 
MICHAEL: ...what? 
MICHAEL: ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork- 
MICHAEL: ...Where did you get that information. 
MICHAEL: ...who works at our hotel. You look, how do you say, radiant tonight. 
MICHAEL: ...would I go near--- 
MICHAEL: ...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that? 
MICHAEL: ...you just gots to get your freak on. 
MICHAEL: ...you were at the dentist? 
MICHAEL: : Hey, you ready? 
MICHAEL: 1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar.   Nicely done. 
MICHAEL: 100 dollars, great. 
MICHAEL: 13 hot dogs, everybody! 
MICHAEL: 160. 
MICHAEL: 300 and one penny, 300 and one penny. 
MICHAEL: 300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice. 
MICHAEL: 325, 325. David 
MICHAEL: 350 and one penny. 
MICHAEL: 350. 
MICHAEL: 4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we? 
MICHAEL: 400 and one penny. 
MICHAEL: 400, 400 hey batter batter. 
MICHAEL: 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam. 
MICHAEL: 500 and one penny. One million dollar! 
MICHAEL: 500. 
MICHAEL: 500. 
MICHAEL: 700. 
MICHAEL: A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us. 
MICHAEL: A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that. 
MICHAEL: A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores?  
MICHAEL: A check for the kids, and for the team. 
MICHAEL: A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered. 
MICHAEL: A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens. 
MICHAEL: A DSi? 
MICHAEL: A fairy princess. You're very... . 
MICHAEL: A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business. 
MICHAEL: A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success. 
MICHAEL: A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is what's at stake. 
MICHAEL: A hat. Blood 
MICHAEL: A horse. 
MICHAEL: A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies! 
MICHAEL: A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people. 
MICHAEL: A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year!  Six seconds, MacGruber!  Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned!  Uh, two seconds MacGruber!  Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION!  MACGRUBERRRR! 
MICHAEL: A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school. 
MICHAEL: A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air. 
MICHAEL: A murder, you say? I do declare. 
MICHAEL: A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful. 
MICHAEL: A one-on-one lunch with Erin? 
MICHAEL: A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen? 
MICHAEL: A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess." 
MICHAEL: A siesta! 
MICHAEL: A surveillance room next to this one. 
MICHAEL: A week? A month? A year? 
MICHAEL: A what? 
MICHAEL: A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that. 
MICHAEL: A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year. 
MICHAEL: A.J. 
MICHAEL: A.J. What kind of name is A.J.? 
MICHAEL: Aaaaaaaa! 
MICHAEL: Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go!   Oh! God! Wow! What was on that? 
MICHAEL: Aaaaaand, go! 
MICHAEL: Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself! 
MICHAEL: Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do? 
MICHAEL: Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it. 
MICHAEL: About talking to the press? 
MICHAEL: About what? 
MICHAEL: About what? 
MICHAEL: About what? 
MICHAEL: About what? 
MICHAEL: Above and beyond. 
MICHAEL: Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night. 
MICHAEL: Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company. 
MICHAEL: Abso-fruit-ly. 
MICHAEL: Absolutely but not really. 
MICHAEL: Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business. 
MICHAEL: Absolutely. 
MICHAEL: Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand. 
MICHAEL: Ach! Wuh--- 
MICHAEL: Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so... Ad guy 
MICHAEL: Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah!  There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord! 
MICHAEL: Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good.  Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok. 
MICHAEL: Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years. 
MICHAEL: Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money. 
MICHAEL: Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys. 
MICHAEL: Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night. 
MICHAEL: Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend. 
MICHAEL: Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
MICHAEL: Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two. 
MICHAEL: Affirmative. 
MICHAEL: Afro wig, do you want the afro wig? 
MICHAEL: After breakfast. 
MICHAEL: After breakfast. 
MICHAEL: After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat 
MICHAEL: After work you guys... 
MICHAEL: After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong. 
MICHAEL: Against who? 
MICHAEL: Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse? 
MICHAEL: Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis.  Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too. 
MICHAEL: Agreed? 
MICHAEL: Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late. Todd 
MICHAEL: Ah ha   Yup. 
MICHAEL: Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!   Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare. 
MICHAEL: Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr. 
MICHAEL: AH! Guh-oood. 
MICHAEL: Ah! Ha ha ha! 
MICHAEL: Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything. 
MICHAEL: Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save? Captain 
MICHAEL: Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name? 
MICHAEL: Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome! 
MICHAEL: Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one. 
MICHAEL: Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive   Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
MICHAEL: Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah... 
MICHAEL: Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me. 
MICHAEL: Ah, fine. 
MICHAEL: Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth. 
MICHAEL: Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night? 
MICHAEL: Ah, great. No further questions. 
MICHAEL: Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?  
MICHAEL: Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters. 
MICHAEL: Ah, just the stupid leads. 
MICHAEL: Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.  
MICHAEL: Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound... The air-conditioning leaking or something? 
MICHAEL: Ah, no. Don't worry about it. 
MICHAEL: Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan. 
MICHAEL: Ah, so when did you set up shop? Prince 
MICHAEL: Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise. 
MICHAEL: Ah, still early. 
MICHAEL: Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you. 
MICHAEL: Ah, thank you sir. 
MICHAEL: Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working. 
MICHAEL: Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check? 
MICHAEL: Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing? 
MICHAEL: Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious!  David Wallace's 
MICHAEL: Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people? 
MICHAEL: Ah, what? Which memo? 
MICHAEL: Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that? 
MICHAEL: Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be..  No, no, meeting's not over. 
MICHAEL: Ah, you are quite the gentleman. 
MICHAEL: Ah, you do. So... 
MICHAEL: Ah. 
MICHAEL: Ah. 
MICHAEL: Ah. 
MICHAEL: Ah.  Your eminence. 
MICHAEL: Ah. A ten inch black and white? 
MICHAEL: Ah. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, you're going to make me say it. All right, I am so proud of all of you. Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name? 
MICHAEL: Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust. 
MICHAEL: Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that. Mr. 
MICHAEL: Ah. Well. That's not true. 
MICHAEL: Ah... 
MICHAEL: Ah... .is that all you have to say? 
MICHAEL: Aha!  
MICHAEL: Ahaha, Yep!   
MICHAEL: A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you. 
MICHAEL: Ahem. What's up? 
MICHAEL: Ahh come on! 
MICHAEL: Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is 
MICHAEL: Ahh, come on. 
MICHAEL: Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef.  Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak.  I see steak. 
MICHAEL: Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! 
MICHAEL: Ahh, thank you. Like a butler. 
MICHAEL: Ahh, that's mine. 
MICHAEL: Ahh, wow. That's dangerous. 
MICHAEL: Ahh. 
MICHAEL: Ahh...  
MICHAEL: Ahhh! Excellent. 
MICHAEL: Ahhh. 
MICHAEL: Ahhh... Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here! 
MICHAEL: AHHHH! 
MICHAEL: Ahhhh... 
MICHAEL: Ahhhhhh!  Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh? 
MICHAEL: Ahoy, matey. 
MICHAEL: Ahoy. So, how you doin'? 
MICHAEL: AIDS. 
MICHAEL: Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild. 
MICHAEL: Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.   Yes, Kevin. 
MICHAEL: All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga!  
MICHAEL: All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such? 
MICHAEL: All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are. 
MICHAEL: All of them. 
MICHAEL: All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck. 
MICHAEL: All of us? 
MICHAEL: All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?! 
MICHAEL: All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge. 
MICHAEL: All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse. 
MICHAEL: All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom- 
MICHAEL: All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library? 
MICHAEL: All right! 
MICHAEL: All right! 
MICHAEL: All right! 
MICHAEL: All right! Cool! 
MICHAEL: All right! Thank you! 
MICHAEL: All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn. 
MICHAEL: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item.   All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around? 
MICHAEL: All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'. 
MICHAEL: All right, all right, I'm on a roll. 
MICHAEL: All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan.  Very good. Excellent, excellent. 
MICHAEL: All right, all right, shh! 
MICHAEL: All right, all right... 
MICHAEL: All right, Andy, please. 
MICHAEL: All right, attention everyone. 
MICHAEL: All right, call--   
MICHAEL: All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch? 
MICHAEL: All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on. 
MICHAEL: All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up.   
MICHAEL: All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction... 
MICHAEL: All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse. 
MICHAEL: All right, get out. Get out. 
MICHAEL: All right, good, well this is what we have to work with. 
MICHAEL: All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there. 
MICHAEL: All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents.   I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes. 
MICHAEL: All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr! 
MICHAEL: All right, I'll be right back.  
MICHAEL: All right, I'm sorry. God. 
MICHAEL: All right, just say "some toys" please. 
MICHAEL: All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. 
MICHAEL: All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet. 
MICHAEL: All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department. 
MICHAEL: All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready? 
MICHAEL: All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands! 
MICHAEL: All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there.  Let's go. 
MICHAEL: All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right. 
MICHAEL: All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered? Liquor Store 
MICHAEL: All right, OK.   Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go! 
MICHAEL: All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE. 
MICHAEL: All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next. 
MICHAEL: All right, see you at one. 
MICHAEL: All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up. 
MICHAEL: All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on. 
MICHAEL: All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store. 
MICHAEL: All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on! 
MICHAEL: All right, um... sorry. 
MICHAEL: All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate! 
MICHAEL: All right, we're starting over. 
MICHAEL: All right, yes. 
MICHAEL: All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right.  
MICHAEL: All right.  And she won't say, "I love you." 
MICHAEL: All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving. 
MICHAEL: All right. All right. Bye. 
MICHAEL: All right. Are we good?  You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment. 
MICHAEL: All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please? 
MICHAEL: All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it. 
MICHAEL: All right. Girl in 2nd 
MICHAEL: All right. Good night. 
MICHAEL: All right. Hope nobody's on a diet. 
MICHAEL: All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone. 
MICHAEL: All right. Mmhmm.   Hey. 
MICHAEL: All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway. 
MICHAEL: All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup- 
MICHAEL: All right. See you around. 
MICHAEL: All right. See you later.   Ahh. 
MICHAEL: All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings. 
MICHAEL: All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no. 
MICHAEL: All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager. 
MICHAEL: All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks. 
MICHAEL: All right. Well, let me show you how it's done. 
MICHAEL: All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell? Hot Dog 
MICHAEL: All right. What's the scoop, how far? 
MICHAEL: All right. Wow. Um, I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives? Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "A" gym and "B" gym, that sort of thing? Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay. Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share. Ummm.  Should we go? 
MICHAEL: All right. You have to pick up after them. 
MICHAEL: All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you.  All right! 
MICHAEL: All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right. 
MICHAEL: All right... 
MICHAEL: All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good. 
MICHAEL: All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding! 
MICHAEL: All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been? 
MICHAEL: All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk?  Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City. 
MICHAEL: Allergies? 
MICHAEL: All-in.  
MICHAEL: Almost quittin' time. 
MICHAEL: Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet. 
MICHAEL: Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner. 
MICHAEL: Alright . 
MICHAEL: Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice. 
MICHAEL: Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today.  Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO. 
MICHAEL: Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse. 
MICHAEL: Alright who wants to party? 
MICHAEL: Alright who's next? Where's Andy? 
MICHAEL: Alright! 
MICHAEL: Alright! 
MICHAEL: Alright! 
MICHAEL: Alright! Here we go! 
MICHAEL: Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise?  Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do. 
MICHAEL: Alright! Who to pick?  Who to pick? 
MICHAEL: Alright, after you. 
MICHAEL: Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards.  I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink! 
MICHAEL: Alright, alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright, alright.  
MICHAEL: Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful. Diane 
MICHAEL: Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense. 
MICHAEL: Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair. 
MICHAEL: Alright, bye. 
MICHAEL: Alright, do you mind if it sit this out? I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out. 
MICHAEL: Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man. Pizza 
MICHAEL: Alright, everybody here? Yes. 
MICHAEL: Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  OK, everybody up! Circle 'round.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor. 
MICHAEL: Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl! 
MICHAEL: Alright, have fun. 
MICHAEL: Alright, here we go. 
MICHAEL: Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready? 
MICHAEL: Alright, I am a local business owner.   I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies 
MICHAEL: Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please. Hotel 
MICHAEL: Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs. 
MICHAEL: Alright, in my defense... 
MICHAEL: Alright, let me explain. Again.  Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's...  ... I have to go make a call. 
MICHAEL: Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this? 
MICHAEL: Alright, okay. Deal! Okay, well... Jim? 
MICHAEL: Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please.  
MICHAEL: Alright, so, teams forming. 
MICHAEL: Alright, that's the way you want it. 
MICHAEL: Alright, that's... 
MICHAEL: Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so - 
MICHAEL: Alright, very good. Ahh, OK.  
MICHAEL: Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary. 
MICHAEL: Alright, well, cool.  Still deciding? 
MICHAEL: Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off. 
MICHAEL: Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we?   
MICHAEL: Alright, you drive. 
MICHAEL: Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit? 
MICHAEL: Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright.  Well, Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Alright!   Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so... 
MICHAEL: Alright. Bye. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Excuse me.  If you will - 
MICHAEL: Alright. Hi. Any messages? 
MICHAEL: Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets... 
MICHAEL: Alright. Larry 
MICHAEL: Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word. 
MICHAEL: Alright. No more meetings this week. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay.  The mind has to wrap around the foot.  Okay. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Oscar, got big plans tonight with- 
MICHAEL: Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you.  
MICHAEL: Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook? The 
MICHAEL: Alright. We need some tunes, I think. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy? 
MICHAEL: Alright... 
MICHAEL: Alright... One more time around the block. 
MICHAEL: Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did. 
MICHAEL: Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler. 
MICHAEL: Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here? 
MICHAEL: Always the bridesmaids, right ladies? 
MICHAEL: Am I a small number person or a severance package person? 
MICHAEL: Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer. 
MICHAEL: Am I scared of getting hit in the face? No. Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege. I'm scared I'm gonna love it.  Let's do this. 
MICHAEL: Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was? 
MICHAEL: Am I the princess? 
MICHAEL: Am I too short? 
MICHAEL: Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me? No, because we are the Three Amigos. And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.  
MICHAEL: AM or PM? 
MICHAEL: An age or month? 
MICHAEL: An electric car dealership.  
MICHAEL: An intervention. It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions. And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves. And then they stop. 
MICHAEL: An office... is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say. But, yes. 
MICHAEL: An oven mitt? Okay.  
MICHAEL: An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley... 
MICHAEL: And -  Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves.  
MICHAEL: And "I... love you." 
MICHAEL: And a woman- 
MICHAEL: And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again. 
MICHAEL: And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before? 
MICHAEL: And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew. 
MICHAEL: And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce. David 
MICHAEL: And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time. David 
MICHAEL: And Cinco de Mayo. 
MICHAEL: And classy, yeah. 
MICHAEL: And dental this time. 
MICHAEL: And distributed things which should not have been distributed. 
MICHAEL: ---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do? What do you do? Come on! What do you do? 
MICHAEL: And fries! 
MICHAEL: And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there? 
MICHAEL: And have a good elevator ride. 
MICHAEL: And he was laughing. 
MICHAEL: And here we have "Mister Roger's Neighborhood." Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs. 
MICHAEL: And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling. 
MICHAEL: And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands. 
MICHAEL: And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager. 
MICHAEL: And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome! Captain 
MICHAEL: And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die. 
MICHAEL: And I nevah got caught, neither. 
MICHAEL: And I offer same day, free delivery. 
MICHAEL: And I really really need to talk to David. 
MICHAEL: And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny. 
MICHAEL: And I want Charles gone. 
MICHAEL: And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there. 
MICHAEL: And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.  "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon." First impressions? 
MICHAEL: And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax. 
MICHAEL: And I was about to take her bra off... 
MICHAEL: And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight?  
MICHAEL: And I will be taking questions. 
MICHAEL: And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch. 
MICHAEL: And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well. 
MICHAEL: And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody... 
MICHAEL: And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels. 
MICHAEL: And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance. 
MICHAEL: And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys? 
MICHAEL: And I'm really looking forward to working with you. 
MICHAEL: And I'm very angry, and I want... 
MICHAEL: And it also helps if you've had five shots. 
MICHAEL: And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night--- 
MICHAEL: And it's all inclusive. 
MICHAEL: And I've dated four women in the last-- 
MICHAEL: And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington. 
MICHAEL: And laughter... also. 
MICHAEL: And many more! 
MICHAEL: And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly. 
MICHAEL: And next to your kids. What? 
MICHAEL: And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to? 
MICHAEL: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?  
MICHAEL: And now, presenting... 
MICHAEL: And now, the chains. 
MICHAEL: And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts... 
MICHAEL: And oh, Jim... 
MICHAEL: And over here.. 
MICHAEL: And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office. 
MICHAEL: And remember no matter what, I will always love you. 
MICHAEL: And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong. 
MICHAEL: And Ryan. 
MICHAEL: And scene. 
MICHAEL: And shake! What? Go ahead. 
MICHAEL: And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.  Jan, I defend your honor.  Is that all? 
MICHAEL: And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. 
MICHAEL: And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first. 
MICHAEL: And sometimes I can hardly handle that! 
MICHAEL: And that her butt refuses to quit! 
MICHAEL: And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear? 
MICHAEL: And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage 
MICHAEL: And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof! 
MICHAEL: And that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black. 
MICHAEL: And that. Is why. I need a smart intern. 
MICHAEL: And that's it. That's me. That's who I am. 
MICHAEL: And the "Tight Ass" award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose. So...come on down. 
MICHAEL: And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes. 
MICHAEL: And the last guy says "No, hairy body". 
MICHAEL: And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin. Mr. 
MICHAEL: And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar?  Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination. 
MICHAEL: And the seats go all the way down. All the way down. 
MICHAEL: And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you,  how you sit like that. 
MICHAEL: And then another-- 
MICHAEL: And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions. 
MICHAEL: And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die. 
MICHAEL: And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business. 
MICHAEL: And there's our smudgeness. 
MICHAEL: And they are having problems, so sh... 
MICHAEL: And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so... 
MICHAEL: And they had no yams? 
MICHAEL: And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.  
MICHAEL: And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man. 
MICHAEL: And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs. 
MICHAEL: And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there? 
MICHAEL: And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...  
MICHAEL: And to King Angela!  Because today we are all kings. And queens . 
MICHAEL: And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms. 
MICHAEL: And we are going to straighten this out. 
MICHAEL: And we are prepared to reject that offer. 
MICHAEL: And we did this whole stupid party for you. 
MICHAEL: And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like. 
MICHAEL: And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time! 
MICHAEL: And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys?  See? They love me. 
MICHAEL: And what is that? 
MICHAEL: And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow. 
MICHAEL: And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O. 
MICHAEL: And you guys are okay with this? 
MICHAEL: And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now. 
MICHAEL: And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.  
MICHAEL: And you sent that out to everyone? 
MICHAEL: And you think that'd be sexy? 
MICHAEL: And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out. 
MICHAEL: And you're okay with that? 
MICHAEL: And, ditto. 
MICHAEL: And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara. 
MICHAEL: And, um, one down. Next 
MICHAEL: And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him. 
MICHAEL: And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else. Pam's 
MICHAEL: And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail. 
MICHAEL: And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches. 
MICHAEL: And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh. 
MICHAEL: And? 
MICHAEL: Andrew, what about you? 
MICHAEL: Andy Bernard. 
MICHAEL: Andy Bernard. 
MICHAEL: Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis? 
MICHAEL: Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted.   Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe.   
MICHAEL: Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap. 
MICHAEL: Andy, what time's the show? 
MICHAEL: Andy, what's the problem? 
MICHAEL: Andy. 
MICHAEL: Andy. 
MICHAEL: Andy? 
MICHAEL: Andy's afwaid? 
MICHAEL: Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone. 
MICHAEL: Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance? 
MICHAEL: Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost. 
MICHAEL: Anorexia. She's an anorexatic. 
MICHAEL: Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations. 
MICHAEL: Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired. 
MICHAEL: Answer the door. 
MICHAEL: Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny? 
MICHAEL: Any emails today? 
MICHAEL: Any good headhunter knows I am available. 
MICHAEL: Any messages for 308? All right. 
MICHAEL: Any messages? 
MICHAEL: Any nuns? 
MICHAEL: Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the "P" situation? 
MICHAEL: Anybody else? Who else has an idea? 
MICHAEL: Anybody making out in here?  Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink.  Okay, how's it going in here?  
MICHAEL: Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on. 
MICHAEL: Anything can happen at the Dundies!  They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time! 
MICHAEL: Anything goes. 
MICHAEL: Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese. 
MICHAEL: Anything? 
MICHAEL: Anything's possible. 
MICHAEL: Apollo Creed. 
MICHAEL: Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough. 
MICHAEL: Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month. 
MICHAEL: Are people watching? 
MICHAEL: Are these facts scaring you, or are they not? 
MICHAEL: Are those all the other complains? 
MICHAEL: Are we all set? 
MICHAEL: Are we both at the right place? 
MICHAEL: Are we over budget? 
MICHAEL: Are we ready for the game? 
MICHAEL: Are you all afwaid? 
MICHAEL: Are you calling Karen? 
MICHAEL: Are you done? ...Good. Okay. 
MICHAEL: Are you going to kill me? 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast? 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're... you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face. 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? Oh! 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? Stop it. 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was. 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? That's my salad. 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding? 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding? 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him. 
MICHAEL: Are you making a-- 
MICHAEL: Are you mental? 
MICHAEL: Are you okay? 
MICHAEL: Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition? 
MICHAEL: Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room? 
MICHAEL: Are you sure? 
MICHAEL: Are you talking to me? 
MICHAEL: Are you wearing a new perfume today? 
MICHAEL: Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out. 
MICHAEL: Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity. 
MICHAEL: Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me. 
MICHAEL: Argh, why are you all... 
MICHAEL: Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me. 
MICHAEL: Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O." 
MICHAEL: As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here. 
MICHAEL: As I was saying it. 
MICHAEL: As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me. 
MICHAEL: As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. Um... I think I can do it. I did it with Jan. 
MICHAEL: As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say. 
MICHAEL: As my associate. 
MICHAEL: As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here. 
MICHAEL: As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice.  You saw the plaque, right?  All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking. 
MICHAEL: Assemble a sales team. A dream team. 
MICHAEL: Assistant to the managed him - 
MICHAEL: Assistant to the regional manager Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
MICHAEL: Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything. 
MICHAEL: At a gas station? 
MICHAEL: At all! 
MICHAEL: At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people. 
MICHAEL: At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are. 
MICHAEL: At home? And I told everybody everything about it. 
MICHAEL: At least. 
MICHAEL: Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars! 
MICHAEL: Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird. 
MICHAEL: Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say. 
MICHAEL: Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died. 
MICHAEL: Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things. 
MICHAEL: Aw, come on Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Aw, it's alright. 
MICHAEL: Aw, my car. 
MICHAEL: Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here. 
MICHAEL: Awesome blossom. 
MICHAEL: Awesome! 
MICHAEL: Awesome. 
MICHAEL: Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever. 
MICHAEL: Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too. 
MICHAEL: Aww, none of your business. 
MICHAEL: Aww, really? 
MICHAEL: Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it. 
MICHAEL: Ayyyy! 
MICHAEL: Ayyyy! 
MICHAEL: Babe alert!   Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig. 
MICHAEL: Baby carrots.  
MICHAEL: Back to the Future?  Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course. Girl in 
MICHAEL: Back to work. 
MICHAEL: Bagel bites or something. 
MICHAEL: Bail'er? I hardly know her. 
MICHAEL: Banana fana fo fanley. 
MICHAEL: Bathroom. 
MICHAEL: Be careful. Oh no!!  Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me!  
MICHAEL: Be my mo manley. 
MICHAEL: Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers. 
MICHAEL: Be respectful, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it. 
MICHAEL: Beard. 
MICHAEL: Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin. 
MICHAEL: Beat it! 
MICHAEL: Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names. 
MICHAEL: Beauty. Thank you sir! 
MICHAEL: Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit. 
MICHAEL: Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate. 
MICHAEL: Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here.  
MICHAEL: Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you. 
MICHAEL: Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay? 
MICHAEL: Because he's afraid to fly. 
MICHAEL: Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill. 
MICHAEL: Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy. 
MICHAEL: Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us. 
MICHAEL: Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update. 
MICHAEL: Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me. 
MICHAEL: Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown. 
MICHAEL: Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay? 
MICHAEL: Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "Well, it's in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is. 
MICHAEL: Because I would kick his ass. 
MICHAEL: Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust. 
MICHAEL: Because it's better. Because it's more special. 
MICHAEL: Because it's very scary stuff. 
MICHAEL: Because of all the good work you've done. 
MICHAEL: Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old. 
MICHAEL: Because that is how my mind works. 
MICHAEL: Because that's all it takes. 
MICHAEL: Because this is the recreation of a crime scene. 
MICHAEL: Because we work together. 
MICHAEL: Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut. 
MICHAEL: Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to Mount Pocono," you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI. 
MICHAEL: Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie. 
MICHAEL: Because you think he's black. 
MICHAEL: Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very... 
MICHAEL: Because, Dwight... never lies. 
MICHAEL: Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing. 
MICHAEL: Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films.  No, slide--- slide it, yes. 
MICHAEL: Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of 
MICHAEL: Been thinking about you. 
MICHAEL: Beep! Bop! 
MICHAEL: Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that? 
MICHAEL: Behold!  Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas.  Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget. 
MICHAEL: Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. "Outside Hire." 
MICHAEL: Believe me its nothing. I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched. 
MICHAEL: Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them. 
MICHAEL: Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here. 
MICHAEL: Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so... 
MICHAEL: Best day ever. Best day ever! 
MICHAEL: Best friends. 
MICHAEL: Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
MICHAEL: Best night ever. 
MICHAEL: BFD. Engaged ain't married. 
MICHAEL: BFD. I'm a screenwriter. 
MICHAEL: Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back? 
MICHAEL: Big... 
MICHAEL: Billy, your nurse is hot. 
MICHAEL: BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess. 
MICHAEL: Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your "Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I don't really see them together". So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food. 
MICHAEL: Birthday party subs! My gift to you. 
MICHAEL: Black tie optional. 
MICHAEL: Blackula! 
MICHAEL: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax. 
MICHAEL: Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up. 
MICHAEL: Blah-di-blah! 
MICHAEL: Blech. 
MICHAEL: Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him.  
MICHAEL: Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small. 
MICHAEL: Blowing up balloons I thought. 
MICHAEL: Blue's not a flavor. 
MICHAEL: Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me? 
MICHAEL: Bluh. 
MICHAEL: Bob, how old are you? Robert 
MICHAEL: Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society. 
MICHAEL: Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  Oil can. Oil can. 
MICHAEL: Bond. 
MICHAEL: Boom! Boom! Improv 
MICHAEL: Boom! Boom! Improv 
MICHAEL: Boom! Freeze! Michael Scoon, FBI. You know what you did. Boom! Boom! Boom!  Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you? Didn't ya!? Well, you didn't, because I know where ya hid the diamonds. I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.  Boom! Boom! Boom! 
MICHAEL: Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go. 
MICHAEL: Boooooo. Thank you. . That's right. 
MICHAEL: Booty call. 
MICHAEL: Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop. 
MICHAEL: Boring. Improv 
MICHAEL: Both sad. 
MICHAEL: Boundaries, Dwight. Come on! 
MICHAEL: Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot.  
MICHAEL: Brain food. Thank you very much. 
MICHAEL: Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea- Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello? 
MICHAEL: Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy... 
MICHAEL: Bring it in. Morning cheer.   Michael, Pam & 
MICHAEL: Bringing home the bacon. 
MICHAEL: Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'. 
MICHAEL: Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go.  Tie these up, cheer up your tubes...  Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake! 
MICHAEL: Bruuuuuuuuuce. 
MICHAEL: Buddha. 
MICHAEL: Buenos dias, Erin. 
MICHAEL: Buenos dias, Jaime. 
MICHAEL: Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model. 
MICHAEL: Burger with cheese! 
MICHAEL: Burned my foot, Pam. 
MICHAEL: Business has been pretty crazy around the office. 
MICHAEL: Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things. 
MICHAEL: Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology. 
MICHAEL: Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people. 
MICHAEL: Busted. 
MICHAEL: Busted. So what can I do for you Holly. 
MICHAEL: But before that, I have to do my presentation. Captain 
MICHAEL: But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two. 
MICHAEL: But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight. Captain 
MICHAEL: But Ed truck can't because he is--- 
MICHAEL: But Grotti acts like he's mafia though. 
MICHAEL: But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model. 
MICHAEL: But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company. 
MICHAEL: But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you. 
MICHAEL: But I got all the foot off of it. 
MICHAEL: But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later. 
MICHAEL: But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy. 
MICHAEL: But I'm the Godfather. 
MICHAEL: But it is already three o'clock!  
MICHAEL: But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say? 
MICHAEL: But it's cool, and it's- 
MICHAEL: But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair. Billy 
MICHAEL: But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do! 
MICHAEL: But thank you, that was really nice of you to say. 
MICHAEL: But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: But the branch is still mine? 
MICHAEL: But then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words. 
MICHAEL: But there's no downsizing, so just don't... 
MICHAEL: But we're bonding down there! 
MICHAEL: But you did still love him. 
MICHAEL: But you just said 15. 
MICHAEL: But you said you liked it. You've always admired it. 
MICHAEL: But you're the best salesman, on the inside. 
MICHAEL: But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems. 
MICHAEL: But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits. 
MICHAEL: But, you will not tell anyone. 
MICHAEL: By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story. 
MICHAEL: By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position. 
MICHAEL: By the bushes? 
MICHAEL: By wanting it more. By working hard- 
MICHAEL: Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just... 
MICHAEL: Bye now. 
MICHAEL: Bye. 
MICHAEL: Bye. 
MICHAEL: Bye. 
MICHAEL: Bye. 
MICHAEL: Bye. 
MICHAEL: Bye-bye. What a nice guy. 
MICHAEL: Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head. 
MICHAEL: Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage. 
MICHAEL: Cake? Who suggested cake?   
MICHAEL: Calling from...  
MICHAEL: Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class?  Whoo! College 
MICHAEL: Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it. Edward R. 
MICHAEL: Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters. 
MICHAEL: Can I have a word with you, Jim? 
MICHAEL: Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar? 
MICHAEL: Can I hold her? 
MICHAEL: Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend. 
MICHAEL: Can I just stay here and never go back? 
MICHAEL: Can I kiss you? 
MICHAEL: Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind. 
MICHAEL: Can I sit down for a second? 
MICHAEL: Can I use it?   
MICHAEL: Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth 
MICHAEL: Can we have a moment?   Can I talk to you for a sec? Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic. 
MICHAEL: Can we have the room please? 
MICHAEL: Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me. 
MICHAEL: Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so 
MICHAEL: Can you believe... cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know about paper. 
MICHAEL: Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two? 
MICHAEL: Can you confirm that the straps are tight? 
MICHAEL: Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something? 
MICHAEL: Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple. 
MICHAEL: Can you stop this? 
MICHAEL: Can you tell who's gay and who's not? 
MICHAEL: Canada. 
MICHAEL: Cancel it! Are you still here?  
MICHAEL: Cancel. We're canceling it.  
MICHAEL: Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned. 
MICHAEL: Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape? 
MICHAEL: Can't talk, saving the planet. 
MICHAEL: Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now. Come on. Come on. 
MICHAEL: Captain Jack has a problem with authority. 
MICHAEL: Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication. 
MICHAEL: Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim. 
MICHAEL: Car starting.  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone. 
MICHAEL: Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much! 
MICHAEL: Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. 
MICHAEL: Carol used to drink lattes. 
MICHAEL: Carol? 
MICHAEL: Carroll, how are you? 
MICHAEL: Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on. 
MICHAEL: Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell? 
MICHAEL: Cause that's... 
MICHAEL: Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness. 
MICHAEL: Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right? Mr. 
MICHAEL: Charles is going to tell you. 
MICHAEL: Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like   Dave died or something. 
MICHAEL: Charley horse! 
MICHAEL: Charley horse! 
MICHAEL: Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable. 
MICHAEL: Check it again. Hit refresh. 
MICHAEL: Check it out. 
MICHAEL: Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee. 
MICHAEL: Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: Check please. 
MICHAEL: Check that out.  Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here? 
MICHAEL: Check this out! Look at that! Look at that  bwup-bwa!  Hello! How are...  Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff. 
MICHAEL: Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook. 
MICHAEL: Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool.  
MICHAEL: Chili's is great. 
MICHAEL: Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is. 
MICHAEL: China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us. 
MICHAEL: Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam. 
MICHAEL: Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time. 
MICHAEL: Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese. 
MICHAEL: Clearly that's what you wanted. 
MICHAEL: Close the door. This is your fault. 
MICHAEL: Close them. 
MICHAEL: Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you. 
MICHAEL: Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight. 
MICHAEL: C'mon Jim, let's go. 
MICHAEL: Coat!  
MICHAEL: Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper! 
MICHAEL: Coffee Jim. 
MICHAEL: Coffee? 
MICHAEL: Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this? 
MICHAEL: Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about. 
MICHAEL: Come here please. 
MICHAEL: Come here.  Don't cash that till Friday, OK? 
MICHAEL: Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist. 
MICHAEL: Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage. 
MICHAEL: Come in. 
MICHAEL: Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough. 
MICHAEL: Come on in. Good to see you. 
MICHAEL: Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign?  "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem." This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem. 
MICHAEL: Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00. 
MICHAEL: Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight! 
MICHAEL: Come on out! 
MICHAEL: Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards! Mr. 
MICHAEL: Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it! 
MICHAEL: Come on! 
MICHAEL: Come on! 
MICHAEL: Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight! 
MICHAEL: Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets. 
MICHAEL: Come on! Phyllis! 
MICHAEL: Come on, Andy, seriously. 
MICHAEL: Come on, come on. 
MICHAEL: Come on, egghead. Let's do it. 
MICHAEL: Come on, everybody. 
MICHAEL: Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest. 
MICHAEL: Come on, let's go back to the party. 
MICHAEL: Come on, man! 
MICHAEL: Come on, seriously, that? 
MICHAEL: Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now! 
MICHAEL: Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize. 
MICHAEL: Come on. 
MICHAEL: Come on. 
MICHAEL: Come on. 
MICHAEL: Come on.  
MICHAEL: Come on.   
MICHAEL: Come on. A little bit. 
MICHAEL: Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend. 
MICHAEL: Come on. Okay, um...  That's as clear as I can make it. 
MICHAEL: Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise. 
MICHAEL: Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up. 
MICHAEL: Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here? 
MICHAEL: Come... Come on! 
MICHAEL: Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people. 
MICHAEL: Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy? 
MICHAEL: Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there. 
MICHAEL: Confidence, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you. Bob 
MICHAEL: Congratulations. 
MICHAEL: Congratulations. 
MICHAEL: Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow. David 
MICHAEL: Cons. Wears too much makeup. 
MICHAEL: Cookie. Kevin, cookie. 
MICHAEL: Cool! 
MICHAEL: Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride?  All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat? 
MICHAEL: Cool, cool. Box it up. 
MICHAEL: Cool.   My horn can pierce the sky. 
MICHAEL: Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now! 
MICHAEL: Cool. For who? 
MICHAEL: Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and...  
MICHAEL: Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later. 
MICHAEL: Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Cool. What next?  
MICHAEL: Cooper's. 
MICHAEL: Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch. 
MICHAEL: Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month. 
MICHAEL: Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould.  Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say. 
MICHAEL: Could have gone better I guess. 
MICHAEL: Could he help us with some parking tickets? 
MICHAEL: Could I be a part of the meeting also? 
MICHAEL: Could I stick it with a pin? 
MICHAEL: Could I talk to you for a second? 
MICHAEL: Could we get a Delorean? 
MICHAEL: Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good. 
MICHAEL: Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them? Blood 
MICHAEL: Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in? 
MICHAEL: Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?   My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much. 
MICHAEL: Could you send her in? 
MICHAEL: Coulda sworn there was... 
MICHAEL: Count the last one. 
MICHAEL: Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one. 
MICHAEL: Crazy world. Lotta smells. 
MICHAEL: Crazy. 
MICHAEL: Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy. 
MICHAEL: Crisis Management Squad. 
MICHAEL: Cruise control. 
MICHAEL: Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing? 
MICHAEL: Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts? 
MICHAEL: Da na na na na!! 
MICHAEL: Da na na na na. 
MICHAEL: Da na na na na. 
MICHAEL: Da na na na na. 
MICHAEL: Da na na na na. 
MICHAEL: Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun. 
MICHAEL: Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you. 
MICHAEL: Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk. 
MICHAEL: Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right. 
MICHAEL: Dammit, Oscar! 
MICHAEL: Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: Damn it Kevin, come on. 
MICHAEL: Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK! 
MICHAEL: Damn it. 
MICHAEL: Damn it. 
MICHAEL: Damn it. 
MICHAEL: Damn it.  Ah, Angelo. 
MICHAEL: Damn it. Come on. 
MICHAEL: Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry.   Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments? 
MICHAEL: Dancing babies! I love it! I love it! 
MICHAEL: Dar de dar. 
MICHAEL: Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing. 
MICHAEL: Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I... "Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today." ... This is one example. 
MICHAEL: Darryl,  have you ever been in a gang? 
MICHAEL: Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I--- 
MICHAEL: Darryl, would you do the honors? 
MICHAEL: Darryl. Noble Darryl.  
MICHAEL: Darryl. There you go.  You earned it. 
MICHAEL: Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl? 
MICHAEL: Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse... 
MICHAEL: Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes. 
MICHAEL: David told me on the phone. David told me. 
MICHAEL: David Wallace told me!! Woman from 
MICHAEL: David will always beat Goliath. Business Student 
MICHAEL: David! 
MICHAEL: David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as. 
MICHAEL: David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever. 
MICHAEL: David, how much did this house cost? 
MICHAEL: David, I did not tell her. 
MICHAEL: David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned. 
MICHAEL: David, wait. 
MICHAEL: David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse. 
MICHAEL: David? 
MICHAEL: David? David? 
MICHAEL: David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone. 
MICHAEL: DEAD. 
MICHAEL: Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy. Darryl's 
MICHAEL: Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together. 
MICHAEL: Definitely. 
MICHAEL: Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed. 
MICHAEL: Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery? 
MICHAEL: Detective Wallace? 
MICHAEL: Devon, could I talk to you for a sec? 
MICHAEL: Devon, wait, please. 
MICHAEL: Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground? 
MICHAEL: Did Darryl touch you? 
MICHAEL: Did everybody know about this but me? 
MICHAEL: Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously? 
MICHAEL: Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died? 
MICHAEL: Did I make more of what we had then what was really there? 
MICHAEL: Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself 
MICHAEL: Did it work? 
MICHAEL: Did she say what it's about? 
MICHAEL: Did somebody order a hooker over here? 
MICHAEL: Did somebody say "baby back ribs"? Hmmm? Hmmmmm? 
MICHAEL: Did we get any mail? 
MICHAEL: Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon. 
MICHAEL: Did you ever have intercourse in this office?   
MICHAEL: Did you explain why? 
MICHAEL: Did you get lucky? Oh! Boink! 
MICHAEL: Did you get the yams? 
MICHAEL: Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg? 
MICHAEL: Did you have a good weekend going there? 
MICHAEL: Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird. 
MICHAEL: Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men. 
MICHAEL: Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite. 
MICHAEL: Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast? 
MICHAEL: Did you pee on a stick? 
MICHAEL: Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it? 
MICHAEL: Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy. Billy 
MICHAEL: Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara. 
MICHAEL: Did you see Holly's butt? 
MICHAEL: Did you see Oprah yesterday? 
MICHAEL: Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it!  Vance Refrigeration 
MICHAEL: Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire? 
MICHAEL: Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton? 
MICHAEL: Did you? 
MICHAEL: Did you? What did you love about it? 
MICHAEL: Didn't move my lips. 
MICHAEL: Dinkin' flicka. 
MICHAEL: Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop. 
MICHAEL: Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor. 
MICHAEL: Disruptive. 
MICHAEL: Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go! 
MICHAEL: Ditto.  How are you Jan? 
MICHAEL: Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..." 
MICHAEL: Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on. 
MICHAEL: Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
MICHAEL: Do I have any messages? 
MICHAEL: Do I have your permission to invite Carol? 
MICHAEL: Do I know a Carol Stills? 
MICHAEL: Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him. 
MICHAEL: Do I know what? 
MICHAEL: Do I look like I am joking? 
MICHAEL: Do I look okay? 
MICHAEL: Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised. 
MICHAEL: Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to. 
MICHAEL: Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing. 
MICHAEL: Do I? 
MICHAEL: Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out. 
MICHAEL: Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this... call waiting.  Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes. 
MICHAEL: Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want? 
MICHAEL: Do not talk like that, Stanley. 
MICHAEL: Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out. 
MICHAEL: Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday. 
MICHAEL: Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may. 
MICHAEL: Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them. 
MICHAEL: Do some... do some work.   People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan. 
MICHAEL: Do that. Do it. 
MICHAEL: Do the monkey face. 
MICHAEL: Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how? 
MICHAEL: Do what? 
MICHAEL: Do you agree about what?  Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute. Other 
MICHAEL: Do you and Pam ever get frisky? 
MICHAEL: Do you fast food? 
MICHAEL: Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan? 
MICHAEL: Do you have everything, guys? 
MICHAEL: Do you know anybody in the mob? 
MICHAEL: Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon. 
MICHAEL: Do you like TCBY? 
MICHAEL: Do you love him now? 
MICHAEL: Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?  
MICHAEL: Do you mind if I wear that for the photo? 
MICHAEL: Do you need 'em? 
MICHAEL: Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you.  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap! 
MICHAEL: Do you really mean that? 
MICHAEL: Do you really wanna know? 
MICHAEL: Do you remember Ed Truck? 
MICHAEL: Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there! 
MICHAEL: Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday? 
MICHAEL: Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this? 
MICHAEL: Do you think she'd keep it quiet? 
MICHAEL: Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you? 
MICHAEL: Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand? 
MICHAEL: Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool? 
MICHAEL: Do you think they have any s'mores? 
MICHAEL: Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe. 
MICHAEL: Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him. 
MICHAEL: Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut? 
MICHAEL: Do you understand, you forced my hand? 
MICHAEL: Do you want an M&M? 
MICHAEL: Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same? 
MICHAEL: Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay? 
MICHAEL: Do you want the raise or what? 
MICHAEL: Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me? 
MICHAEL: Do you want to hear a lie? 
MICHAEL: Do you want to talk about it anymore? 
MICHAEL: Do you... just... you're kind of losing them. 
MICHAEL: Do you? David 
MICHAEL: Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you? 
MICHAEL: Do your worst.  
MICHAEL: Dockworker's? 
MICHAEL: Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury? 
MICHAEL: Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills? 
MICHAEL: Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country? 
MICHAEL: Does David know this? 
MICHAEL: Does your stupid husband have it? 
MICHAEL: Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us? 
MICHAEL: Doesn't matter. Out please! 
MICHAEL: Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close. 
MICHAEL: Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes? 
MICHAEL: Don't ape me. 
MICHAEL: Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom!  Don't even watch, Halpert! 
MICHAEL: Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this! 
MICHAEL: Don't be. You should never settle for who you are.  Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are- 
MICHAEL: Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you? 
MICHAEL: Don't bother Luke. 
MICHAEL: Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop. 
MICHAEL: Don't drink all of it. Give some to Oscar. 
MICHAEL: Don't drink and drive. 
MICHAEL: Don't even think about that  
MICHAEL: Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her. 
MICHAEL: Don't get hysterical. 
MICHAEL: Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go. 
MICHAEL: Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me! 
MICHAEL: Don't let us down. 
MICHAEL: Don't make fun... You're making fun of me. 
MICHAEL: Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute.  
MICHAEL: Don't patronize me, Pam. 
MICHAEL: Don't run. 
MICHAEL: Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass? 
MICHAEL: Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please. 
MICHAEL: Don't sell your implants please. 
MICHAEL: Don't shave my lips. 
MICHAEL: Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan. 
MICHAEL: Don't talk- 
MICHAEL: Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you. 
MICHAEL: Don't tell them we have free delivery!   
MICHAEL: Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo! 
MICHAEL: Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes 
MICHAEL: Don't touch me this time. 
MICHAEL: Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you. 
MICHAEL: Don't whine. Get the window.  
MICHAEL: Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. 
MICHAEL: Don't you work here full-time? 
MICHAEL: Don't! 
MICHAEL: Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it? 
MICHAEL: Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever. 
MICHAEL: Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise. 
MICHAEL: Don't, don't. 
MICHAEL: Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot. 
MICHAEL: Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day. 
MICHAEL: Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke. 
MICHAEL: Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people. 
MICHAEL: Don't... 
MICHAEL: Don't... 
MICHAEL: Don't... 
MICHAEL: Don't... I... 
MICHAEL: Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony. 
MICHAEL: Dot com! 
MICHAEL: Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me. 
MICHAEL: Doubt it.  Dwight and 
MICHAEL: Drinks are on me! 
MICHAEL: Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children. 
MICHAEL: Drugs? 
MICHAEL: Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya! 
MICHAEL: Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head. 
MICHAEL: Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it. 
MICHAEL: Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this 
MICHAEL: Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre.  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses. Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses. 
MICHAEL: Dunder Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!!   
MICHAEL: Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT! 
MICHAEL: Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay.  I just did. 
MICHAEL: During our relaxation exercise? 
MICHAEL: Dwight-- 
MICHAEL: Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day. 
MICHAEL: Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three. 
MICHAEL: Dwight does not play a robot. 
MICHAEL: Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys? 
MICHAEL: Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot. 
MICHAEL: Dwight is my friend. 
MICHAEL: Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing. 
MICHAEL: Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness. 
MICHAEL: Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. 
MICHAEL: Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way. 
MICHAEL: Dwight! 
MICHAEL: Dwight! Dwight! 
MICHAEL: Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog? 
MICHAEL: Dwight! Jesus! 
MICHAEL: Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do? 
MICHAEL: Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid.  
MICHAEL: Dwight, can I talk to you for a second? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, can you get those please? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, could you move over a little bit. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, do you have the box? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, do you mind if we talk? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, Dwight! 
MICHAEL: Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, find out what the present is. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, get the door. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow.  
MICHAEL: Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, I'm the boss. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, just... 
MICHAEL: Dwight, not now, we've been robbed. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this.  Brrr! That's strong! 
MICHAEL: Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, run! 
MICHAEL: Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, they called your name. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, what are you drinking? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, what is the traffic like? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, what is your middle name. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, you gotta move! 
MICHAEL: Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot!  
MICHAEL: Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, you ignorant slut. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study! 
MICHAEL: Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, your feedback is horrible. 
MICHAEL: Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Dwight.   I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate. 
MICHAEL: Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room. 
MICHAEL: Dwight. Hey! 
MICHAEL: Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much. 
MICHAEL: Dwight... 
MICHAEL: Dwight... 
MICHAEL: Dwight...  You just keep your eyes on the road.  Give me the bottle or you're fired. 
MICHAEL: Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into. 
MICHAEL: Earlier today. 
MICHAEL: Easy no. 
MICHAEL: Easy. 
MICHAEL: Eat it! 
MICHAEL: Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it. 
MICHAEL: Ed Truck.  Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work." What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away. 
MICHAEL: Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women. 
MICHAEL: Eh. 
MICHAEL: Ehhhh.... 
MICHAEL: EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok. 
MICHAEL: Eight months? 
MICHAEL: Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin? Robert 
MICHAEL: Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind. 
MICHAEL: Electricity. 
MICHAEL: Eleven pounds... 
MICHAEL: Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it. 
MICHAEL: Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here. 
MICHAEL: Enabler! Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler. It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help. 
MICHAEL: Ener-gize... 
MICHAEL: English? 
MICHAEL: Entourage! 
MICHAEL: Eric likes Megan. 
MICHAEL: Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone? 
MICHAEL: Erin, can you give us a second? 
MICHAEL: Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together? 
MICHAEL: Erin, do we have the journal? 
MICHAEL: Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart.  And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will.  And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime. 
MICHAEL: Erin, look.  
MICHAEL: Erin, what about my keyboard?  Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova? 
MICHAEL: Erin... what are you doing? 
MICHAEL: Erin? 
MICHAEL: Erin? 
MICHAEL: Espresso? 
MICHAEL: European offices are naked all the time. 
MICHAEL: Evan, this is Jim. 
MICHAEL: Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me. 
MICHAEL: Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. "You can't be on the team", "You can't move on to second grade". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods.  We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class. 
MICHAEL: Every morning. 
MICHAEL: Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.  
MICHAEL: Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. "Michael, buy a motorcycle." So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now. 
MICHAEL: Everybody enjoying their meal? 
MICHAEL: Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime. 
MICHAEL: Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes. 
MICHAEL: Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to  Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there. 
MICHAEL: Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on! 
MICHAEL: Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager. 
MICHAEL: Everybody, except Stanley. 
MICHAEL: Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach. 
MICHAEL: Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. "Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in." Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black? 
MICHAEL: Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy? 
MICHAEL: Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site. 
MICHAEL: Everybody? If... could do it? "Meredith is so old..." 
MICHAEL: Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy. 
MICHAEL: Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out. 
MICHAEL: Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley! 
MICHAEL: Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with. 
MICHAEL: Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle. 
MICHAEL: Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.  So, take it away. 
MICHAEL: Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny! 
MICHAEL: Everyone, now   calm down! 
MICHAEL: Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while. 
MICHAEL: Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this! 
MICHAEL: Everything here was made in China, Pam. 
MICHAEL: Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed. 
MICHAEL: Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression. 
MICHAEL: Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel. 
MICHAEL: Exactly that. 
MICHAEL: Exactly that. 
MICHAEL: Exactly! 
MICHAEL: Exactly! 
MICHAEL: Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that? 
MICHAEL: Exactly, were not... Mr. 
MICHAEL: Exactly. 
MICHAEL: Exactly. 
MICHAEL: Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing. 
MICHAEL: Exactly. What are you thinking? 
MICHAEL: Excellent! 
MICHAEL: Excellent! 
MICHAEL: Excellent! Good job. 
MICHAEL: Excellent! Way to go! Nice!   Prince 
MICHAEL: Excellent. 
MICHAEL: Excellent. 
MICHAEL: Except driving. 
MICHAEL: Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work. 
MICHAEL: Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.   Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared. 
MICHAEL: Excited to talk ideas. Ad guy 
MICHAEL: Excuse me  Ah, un guard.  Family style. 
MICHAEL: Excuse me for a second.  
MICHAEL: Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun. 
MICHAEL: Excuse me, everyone... SEX! Now that I have your attention... 
MICHAEL: Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys! Meredith, Creed, Oscar and 
MICHAEL: Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? 
MICHAEL: Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go? Blood Drive 
MICHAEL: Excuse me. Yes? 
MICHAEL: Explain that. Financial 
MICHAEL: Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.  
MICHAEL: Fantastic! 
MICHAEL: Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur? 
MICHAEL: Federal and State.   
MICHAEL: Feelin' hot, hot, hot!  Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing. 
MICHAEL: Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot!  
MICHAEL: Ferris wheel's pretty cool though. 
MICHAEL: Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot. 
MICHAEL: Fillipellers, how's it hanging? 
MICHAEL: Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat?   Let's all clap at Phyllis.   Ok!   When Michael Clump wants to remind you   that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy. And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Kelly.   Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go.   Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful? 
MICHAEL: Find a key. 
MICHAEL: Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes. 
MICHAEL: Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests. 
MICHAEL: Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those. 
MICHAEL: Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City. Jim and 
MICHAEL: Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along.   However, I rescind my apology. 
MICHAEL: Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.  
MICHAEL: Fine, just go crazy for a little while! Lookin' good! You're lookin' good.  Oh, I gotcha! I gotcha! I'm pulling you back! Michael dance off! 
MICHAEL: Fine. 
MICHAEL: Fine. Fine. 
MICHAEL: Fine. I love you. 
MICHAEL: Fine. Then God speed. To both of us. 
MICHAEL: Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.  
MICHAEL: Finish your cake, Helene. 
MICHAEL: Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that. 
MICHAEL: Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex. 
MICHAEL: First got priorities. 
MICHAEL: First guy says "Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn". And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort". And the third guy says "I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe". 
MICHAEL: First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party. 
MICHAEL: Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy? 
MICHAEL: Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be? 
MICHAEL: Five years old? 
MICHAEL: Five, four, three. "There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day." 
MICHAEL: Flower shops, fireworks celebrations... 
MICHAEL: Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs. 
MICHAEL: Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like...  Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah... 
MICHAEL: For a CD mix tape... 
MICHAEL: For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical. 
MICHAEL: For Holly. 
MICHAEL: For instance, why don't you go to business... 
MICHAEL: For me, too. You embarrassed me. 
MICHAEL: For the insurance money! I knew it all along!  You will never get away with this!  
MICHAEL: For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover? 
MICHAEL: For what? 
MICHAEL: For what? 
MICHAEL: For you, job well done. 
MICHAEL: For? 
MICHAEL: Forget it! Forget it! 
MICHAEL: Forget that. 
MICHAEL: Forget the question... 
MICHAEL: For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now, you are to use one check a year. And please call me before you cash the check? Cause I've got monies to move around. 
MICHAEL: Forty... I'm in my forties. Girl in 
MICHAEL: Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School". 
MICHAEL: Foul! Foul! 
MICHAEL: Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized. 
MICHAEL: Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again. You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all. There's a lot of princesses out there. You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good. 
MICHAEL: Four!  Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites.  All right, here we go! 
MICHAEL: Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs! 
MICHAEL: Fourteen years. 
MICHAEL: Frame him? 
MICHAEL: Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is... 
MICHAEL: French. Classy. 
MICHAEL: Friends fight. Friends fight. 
MICHAEL: Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions? 
MICHAEL: Funk is the problem and the solution. 
MICHAEL: Funny 
MICHAEL: Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh! 
MICHAEL: Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed! 
MICHAEL: Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is.  You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons. 
MICHAEL: Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray. 
MICHAEL: Gah, the dreadmill.   
MICHAEL: Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her. 
MICHAEL: Gahh, I will pull this car over! 
MICHAEL: Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly. 
MICHAEL: Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations. Battleship got me through my parents' divorce. Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation. I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across. 
MICHAEL: Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay. 
MICHAEL: Gay. 
MICHAEL: Geesh, Dwight! 
MICHAEL: Get a... yeah! Good riddance. 
MICHAEL: Get back to work, Dwight. Please. 
MICHAEL: Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums. 
MICHAEL: Get 'em there. Get 'em there. 
MICHAEL: Get in here... everybody. 
MICHAEL: Get in the back please. 
MICHAEL: Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it!   
MICHAEL: Get in there! 
MICHAEL: Get lost. 
MICHAEL: Get lost. 
MICHAEL: Get me Armani. 
MICHAEL: Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah. 
MICHAEL: Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen!  Oh, here we go. 
MICHAEL: Get out of here. 
MICHAEL: Get out of the way! Go, go, go! 
MICHAEL: Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. 
MICHAEL: Get out. 
MICHAEL: Get out. 
MICHAEL: Get Ryan. He needs to lift me.  and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel. 
MICHAEL: Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please.

MICHAEL: Good, so, we're on the same page? 
MICHAEL: Good, stand up.  You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore. 
MICHAEL: Good, that is what's most important. 
MICHAEL: Good, we're all here, we can get started. 
MICHAEL: Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.

MICHAEL: Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that. 
MICHAEL: Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model... 
MICHAEL: Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner.

MICHAEL: Good. The Small Business Man? 
MICHAEL: Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen. 
MICHAEL: Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though.

MICHAEL: Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot? 
MICHAEL: Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch? 
MICHAEL: Good. Yep. 
MICHAEL: Good-bye! 
MICHAEL: Goodnight! 
MICHAEL: Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? 
MICHAEL: Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper" and get them to "Show us the money!" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen.   Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name? 
MICHAEL: Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now.  She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed.  I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that? 
MICHAEL: Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured... 
MICHAEL: Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision. 
MICHAEL: Got it. 
MICHAEL: Got it. It works. 
MICHAEL: Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league. 
MICHAEL: Got them on their feet. 
MICHAEL: Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time. 
MICHAEL: Gotcha!  Oh, God.  Crap! Nothin' how ya doing? 
MICHAEL: Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea. 
MICHAEL: Grab you here. 
MICHAEL: Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon? 
MICHAEL: Grass, weed? 
MICHAEL: Great 
MICHAEL: Great work tonight. 
MICHAEL: Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss. 
MICHAEL: Great, the magic of the gift basket. 
MICHAEL: Great. Cool. Cool.  Yeah, okay. 
MICHAEL: Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped. 
MICHAEL: Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge? 
MICHAEL: Great. Robert 
MICHAEL: Great. Robert 
MICHAEL: Grenadine. Bar 
MICHAEL: Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair. 
MICHAEL: Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please...   Can anybody guess? 
MICHAEL: Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make. 
MICHAEL: Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color. 
MICHAEL: Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo. 
MICHAEL: Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo? 
MICHAEL: Guh. 
MICHAEL: Guilty! Guilty as charged! 
MICHAEL: Guilty. 
MICHAEL: Guilty. 
MICHAEL: Guys! Want to start unloading the truck? 
MICHAEL: Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat? 
MICHAEL: Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang. 
MICHAEL: Guys, guys- 
MICHAEL: Guys, guys! 
MICHAEL: Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go.  Ready? 
MICHAEL: Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat! 
MICHAEL: Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is. 
MICHAEL: Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone. 
MICHAEL: Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  Pudge has driven the forklift. 
MICHAEL: Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on? 
MICHAEL: Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same? 
MICHAEL: Guys, she's in there. 
MICHAEL: Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends. 
MICHAEL: Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping... 
MICHAEL: Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight! 
MICHAEL: Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me! 
MICHAEL: Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single. 
MICHAEL: Ha! That-- I am not known for that! 
MICHAEL: Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there.   Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.   So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought   sorry.   I think I have a frog in my throat. Um...   I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um...   
MICHAEL: Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile  Second 
MICHAEL: Haha, we struck the mother load! 
MICHAEL: Half pants, right Mr. Franklin? Ben 
MICHAEL: Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast. 
MICHAEL: Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady. 
MICHAEL: Hamster. 
MICHAEL: Handed to me as I sat down. This was my hot towel. It is still wet. 
MICHAEL: Hang up.  You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket! 
MICHAEL: Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads. 
MICHAEL: Hank? You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort Charles from the building. 
MICHAEL: Hannah? 
MICHAEL: Happy Halloween, everyone!  Oh... that's great! 
MICHAEL: Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office. 
MICHAEL: Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy! Video 
MICHAEL: Happy. 
MICHAEL: Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative"? 
MICHAEL: Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs. 
MICHAEL: Have a good night. 
MICHAEL: Have a seat. 
MICHAEL: Have a seat. 
MICHAEL: Have a seat. Like everybody else. 
MICHAEL: Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster. 
MICHAEL: Have to think it through. Because if they say no... 
MICHAEL: Have you ever seen Santa? 
MICHAEL: Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church? 
MICHAEL: Have you met that kid? He's not going to college. 
MICHAEL: Having fun? 
MICHAEL: Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest. 
MICHAEL: Hawkman. 
MICHAEL: He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer. 
MICHAEL: He didn't say. 
MICHAEL: He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired. 
MICHAEL: He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave. 
MICHAEL: He gives the best back rubs in the office. 
MICHAEL: He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works.  A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here? 
MICHAEL: He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation. 
MICHAEL: He hasn't changed. 
MICHAEL: He is an organ donor. 
MICHAEL: He is I. Bar 
MICHAEL: He is in an all-out sprint. 
MICHAEL: He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him. 
MICHAEL: He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.  It was right under his nose. I had to tell him. 
MICHAEL: He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man. 
MICHAEL: He is. 
MICHAEL: He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic. 
MICHAEL: He looks worse. 
MICHAEL: He said no. 
MICHAEL: He said, we have been sold.  
MICHAEL: He said, where is the bomb? 
MICHAEL: He sounded sick. 
MICHAEL: He sounds like a nice guy. 
MICHAEL: He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom. 
MICHAEL: He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes. 
MICHAEL: He will be ushering you out.   
MICHAEL: He worked at that telemarketing place. 
MICHAEL: he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay. Bob 
MICHAEL: He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great. 
MICHAEL: Head table, where I belong. 
MICHAEL: Hed. Hedded 
MICHAEL: Heed. Heed. 
MICHAEL: Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see.  
MICHAEL: Heh, okay, weirdo. 
MICHAEL: Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her. 
MICHAEL: Helene? 
MICHAEL: Helene? 
MICHAEL: Hellloo...   
MICHAEL: Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.  So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.

It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta. 
MICHAEL: Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.

MICHAEL: Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby. 
MICHAEL: Here is your headline. "Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done." Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go! 
MICHAEL: Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat.  We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.

MICHAEL: Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J. 
MICHAEL: Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.

MICHAEL: He's going to absolutely freak. 
MICHAEL: He's going to swallow is tongue. 
MICHAEL: He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse?  This is the reason we're here. 
MICHAEL: He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go. 
MICHAEL: He's in his knickers. Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever. Ben 
MICHAEL: He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible. 
MICHAEL: He's not going to be a murderer. 
MICHAEL: He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though.  Ah! It's not cappuccino. 
MICHAEL: He's right there. There he is. Bob 
MICHAEL: He's stealing them. Okay, okay. 
MICHAEL: He's the longest baby in this room. 
MICHAEL: He's totally wrong, Pam.  Hey.

MICHAEL: Hey there. 
MICHAEL: Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier. 
MICHAEL: Hey Toby. What's this?  
MICHAEL: Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away? 
MICHAEL: Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who. 
MICHAEL: Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please? 
MICHAEL: Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.

MICHAEL: Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this. 
MICHAEL: Hey! Hi, good to see you. 
MICHAEL: Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire. 
MICHAEL: Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.

MICHAEL: Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward. 
MICHAEL: Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out. 
MICHAEL: Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--

MICHAEL: Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up? 
MICHAEL: Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man? 
MICHAEL: Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude. 
MICHAEL: Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport? 
MICHAEL: Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything? 
MICHAEL: Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party? 
MICHAEL: Hey, right?

MICHAEL: Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it. 
MICHAEL: Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later. 
MICHAEL: Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about? 
MICHAEL: Hey, Toby. 
MICHAEL: Hey, uh, can I help you out in here? Mr. 
MICHAEL: Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do. 
MICHAEL: Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest." 
MICHAEL: Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship. 
MICHAEL: Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen? 
MICHAEL: Hey, what a game, huh? What a game. 
MICHAEL: Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman. 
MICHAEL: Hey, what are you guys doing in here? 
MICHAEL: Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you... 
MICHAEL: Hey, what time is it? 
MICHAEL: Hey, whatcha gettin'? 
MICHAEL: Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues? 
MICHAEL: Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2? 
MICHAEL: Hey, what's up. 
MICHAEL: Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think? 
MICHAEL: Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me? 
MICHAEL: Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right? 
MICHAEL: Hey, you don't deserve her. 
MICHAEL: Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize. Bar 
MICHAEL: Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, let's go. 
MICHAEL: Hey, you know what? I can't do this by myself people! Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out.   
MICHAEL: Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you- Limo 
MICHAEL: Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day. 
MICHAEL: Hey, you. 
MICHAEL: Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey.   Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless. 
MICHAEL: Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot. 
MICHAEL: Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional. 
MICHAEL: Hey. How's everybody doing? 
MICHAEL: Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much?  Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to. 
MICHAEL: Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in. 
MICHAEL: Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please.   It's Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited! 
MICHAEL: Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight? 
MICHAEL: Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch. All the 
MICHAEL: Hey. What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: Hey. What... 
MICHAEL: Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her. Second 
MICHAEL: Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over. 
MICHAEL: Hey. Wow. 
MICHAEL: Hey... 
MICHAEL: Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us. 
MICHAEL: Hi Ben, Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: Hi Donna. It's Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hi Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye. 
MICHAEL: Hi Santa. 
MICHAEL: Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far? 
MICHAEL: Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine. 
MICHAEL: Hi, Carol. How you doing? 
MICHAEL: Hi, Darryl, come out here, please. 
MICHAEL: Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret? 
MICHAEL: Hi, guys. 
MICHAEL: Hi, I am well, how are you? 
MICHAEL: Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning?  
MICHAEL: Hi, is it over? 
MICHAEL: Hi, Jan! 
MICHAEL: Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't.   Come on. Let's go in. 
MICHAEL: Hi, Jan. How are you? 
MICHAEL: Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott. Well, this is slightly embarrassing.   Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday. Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check. 
MICHAEL: Hi, Mema. It's Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hi, Oscar its Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hi. 
MICHAEL: Hi. 
MICHAEL: Hi. 
MICHAEL: Hi. 
MICHAEL: Hi. 
MICHAEL: Hi. 
MICHAEL: Hi.  
MICHAEL: Hi.  How did you know I was up here? 
MICHAEL: Hi.  No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here? 
MICHAEL: Hi. Bar 
MICHAEL: Hi. Hi. Oh...  
MICHAEL: Hi. How are you? 
MICHAEL: Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left. Pretzel 
MICHAEL: Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see... Mrs. 
MICHAEL: Hi. What is the name of our town? 
MICHAEL: Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work 
MICHAEL: Hilarious. Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it? 
MICHAEL: Hm? 
MICHAEL: Hm? Okay. Yep. 
MICHAEL: Hmm, hmm. 
MICHAEL: Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer? 
MICHAEL: Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think...  that maybe you should...  
MICHAEL: Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that. 
MICHAEL: Hmm.. 
MICHAEL: Hmm.. 
MICHAEL: Hmm... 
MICHAEL: Hmm... 
MICHAEL: Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So... 
MICHAEL: Hmm? 
MICHAEL: Hmm? 
MICHAEL: Hmm? 
MICHAEL: Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em. Sweeney 
MICHAEL: Hmmm, dare I?   You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.   Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex.   
MICHAEL: Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy. 
MICHAEL: Hmmm. 
MICHAEL: Hmmm. Ha.  Alright. Great. 
MICHAEL: Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds. 
MICHAEL: Ho-ho, man! Wow.   Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba-- 
MICHAEL: Hold down the fort, I have to do something.  Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force?  Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe. 
MICHAEL: Hold it, hold it.  Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same? 
MICHAEL: Hold on a second, Cynthia. 
MICHAEL: Hold on, hold on! Just- 
MICHAEL: Hold on, Holly's coming back here? 
MICHAEL: Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads... 
MICHAEL: Holdin' down the fort. 
MICHAEL: Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it.  It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you. 
MICHAEL: Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart. 
MICHAEL: Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it. 
MICHAEL: Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ? 
MICHAEL: Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down. 
MICHAEL: Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving. 
MICHAEL: Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level. 
MICHAEL: Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be. 
MICHAEL: Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room. 
MICHAEL: Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up. 
MICHAEL: Holly. Hey. 
MICHAEL: Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party. 
MICHAEL: Home, sweet home. 
MICHAEL: Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself. 
MICHAEL: Honey and jelly sandwich time.  
MICHAEL: Ho-oh! 
MICHAEL: Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out. 
MICHAEL: Hooters? 
MICHAEL: Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors. 
MICHAEL: How about July 4th weekend?  
MICHAEL: How about never hundred hours, sir. Ad guy 
MICHAEL: How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything. 
MICHAEL: How about some Splenda? 
MICHAEL: How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it? 
MICHAEL: How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.' 
MICHAEL: How about this one? It's Christmas eve--- Concierge 
MICHAEL: How about this weekend? 
MICHAEL: How about Thursday? 
MICHAEL: How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly? 
MICHAEL: How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office? 
MICHAEL: How are you doing? 
MICHAEL: How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends. 
MICHAEL: How can I get you to stay? 
MICHAEL: How can you be sure? 
MICHAEL: How can you do that to me? 
MICHAEL: How can you give up my diary like that? 
MICHAEL: How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black? Mr. 
MICHAEL: How come you didn't get me one? 
MICHAEL: How could she do this to me, Pam? 
MICHAEL: How dare you sir. You are gross. 
MICHAEL: How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people. 
MICHAEL: How did this happen, how did I get this? 
MICHAEL: How did we do it? 
MICHAEL: How did you get in your wheelchair? Billy 
MICHAEL: How did you know? 
MICHAEL: How did you... 
MICHAEL: How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned. 
MICHAEL: How do I not make any more of it? 
MICHAEL: How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice? 
MICHAEL: How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point? 
MICHAEL: How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive. 
MICHAEL: How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea? 
MICHAEL: How do you know Michael Clump? 
MICHAEL: How do you know that? What is it, then? 
MICHAEL: How do you know? 
MICHAEL: How do you mean? 
MICHAEL: How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so." Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way. 
MICHAEL: How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including "Stanley is having an affair." It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit. 
MICHAEL: How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need. 
MICHAEL: How is that funny? Sweeney 
MICHAEL: How is that possible? 
MICHAEL: How late do we have to work tonight? 
MICHAEL: How long is it? 
MICHAEL: How long till we get to Mexico? 
MICHAEL: How many is that? 
MICHAEL: How many miles did he do last year? 
MICHAEL: How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee?  And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?  That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute? 
MICHAEL: How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy? Financial 
MICHAEL: How much time do you think you'll need? 
MICHAEL: How much? How many pounds is it? Vance Refrigeration 
MICHAEL: How often can you actually donate blood? 
MICHAEL: How old are you? 
MICHAEL: How so, specifically? 
MICHAEL: How strange. Because they always have yams. 
MICHAEL: How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%? 
MICHAEL: How we doing on time? 
MICHAEL: How would I know? 
MICHAEL: How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose. 
MICHAEL: How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator. 
MICHAEL: How ya doin'? Mr. 
MICHAEL: How you doin'? You excited. 
MICHAEL: How you doing stud? You already there? Todd 
MICHAEL: How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.  Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby. 
MICHAEL: How, would you stop interrupting please? 
MICHAEL: How? 
MICHAEL: How? 
MICHAEL: How? 
MICHAEL: Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges. 
MICHAEL: Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think. 
MICHAEL: How'd you even find it? 
MICHAEL: How's everybody doing today? 
MICHAEL: How's it going? 
MICHAEL: How's the lady situation? Todd 
MICHAEL: How's the party coming along? 
MICHAEL: How's this place treating you? 
MICHAEL: HR stuff?  HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley.  What is that? What kind of stuff is that? 
MICHAEL: Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate. 
MICHAEL: Huh-   Does she ever talk about me?   
MICHAEL: Huh, okay. 
MICHAEL: Huh. 
MICHAEL: Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot. 
MICHAEL: Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist. 
MICHAEL: Huh. Well, maybe those will help.  
MICHAEL: Huh? 
MICHAEL: Huh? 
MICHAEL: Huh? He might do it... 
MICHAEL: Humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna- 
MICHAEL: Hup!   
MICHAEL: Hup!   
MICHAEL: Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means?  Not real. 
MICHAEL: I- 
MICHAEL: I actually wrote a movie. Co-Worker 
MICHAEL: I agree. 
MICHAEL: I agree. He'd land on his feet. 
MICHAEL: I already declared you, it was too dark to tell. 
MICHAEL: I already have wine. 
MICHAEL: I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael." 
MICHAEL: I am a bank teller. 
MICHAEL: I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course. 
MICHAEL: I am a grown-up, Jim. 
MICHAEL: I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans. 
MICHAEL: I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald.   I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it. 
MICHAEL: I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about. 
MICHAEL: I am about to give blood. The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that -- Blood Drive 
MICHAEL: I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody. 
MICHAEL: I am already walking. 
MICHAEL: I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America. 
MICHAEL: I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket.   You are now sexy in your culture. 
MICHAEL: I am Beyonce always. 
MICHAEL: I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep. 
MICHAEL: I am dead inside. 
MICHAEL: I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.  
MICHAEL: I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people. 
MICHAEL: I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie. 
MICHAEL: I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said. 
MICHAEL: I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back. 
MICHAEL: I am going to give Toby... 
MICHAEL: I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan? Miss 
MICHAEL: I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me. 
MICHAEL: I am going to go get laid. Goodbye. 
MICHAEL: I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works. 
MICHAEL: I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service.   
MICHAEL: I am going to scare these kids so bad. 
MICHAEL: I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone. 
MICHAEL: I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening. 
MICHAEL: I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield.  Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, "I don't respect you!" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example.  If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck.  Respect is niiice. Borat.  What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect! 
MICHAEL: I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello. Bar 
MICHAEL: I am hurt. I hurt my foot. 
MICHAEL: I am in. 
MICHAEL: I am jetting off on an international business trip. 
MICHAEL: I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying. 
MICHAEL: I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer. 
MICHAEL: I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained. 
MICHAEL: I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am. 
MICHAEL: I am makin' it happen, sergeant. 
MICHAEL: I am not a mind reader, David. 
MICHAEL: I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic. 
MICHAEL: I am not budging on the hat issue. 
MICHAEL: I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin. 
MICHAEL: I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin. 
MICHAEL: I am not going to tell you anything. 
MICHAEL: I am not in the mood for riddles pam. 
MICHAEL: I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse. 
MICHAEL: I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred. 
MICHAEL: I am not. I just have had a bad day. And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now. 
MICHAEL: I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too. 
MICHAEL: I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me. 
MICHAEL: I am on my way. I should be there in about 15... 
MICHAEL: I am Pam. Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay.  Whoa! God! Yuck, yuck. Yuck. Yuck! 
MICHAEL: I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been---  Ow! What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point!  
MICHAEL: I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all. 
MICHAEL: I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you.  
MICHAEL: I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind. 
MICHAEL: I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack. 
MICHAEL: I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane. 
MICHAEL: I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems. 
MICHAEL: I am sorry that I have to do this...  
MICHAEL: I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation. 
MICHAEL: I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died. 
MICHAEL: I am telling Andy. 
MICHAEL: I am the guy who roused that crowd. 
MICHAEL: I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character "Mikanos", is just a little added flava. "Mikanos" is loosely based on another character I do, "Spiros", who is more about the ladies. 
MICHAEL: I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled. 
MICHAEL: I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me.  Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter. 
MICHAEL: I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star. 
MICHAEL: I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention. 
MICHAEL: I am well, sir, how are you? 
MICHAEL: I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for. 
MICHAEL: I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo. 
MICHAEL: I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez. 
MICHAEL: I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in? 
MICHAEL: I am. Mr. 
MICHAEL: I am? 
MICHAEL: I appreciate that, thank you. 
MICHAEL: I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is. 
MICHAEL: I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think? 
MICHAEL: I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go. 
MICHAEL: I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun. 
MICHAEL: I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues. 
MICHAEL: I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv. 
MICHAEL: I bet, for you. 
MICHAEL: I bet. 
MICHAEL: I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off? 
MICHAEL: I Braveheart. I am. 
MICHAEL: I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry. 
MICHAEL: I call shuffle. Here we go.  
MICHAEL: I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm. Pam's 
MICHAEL: I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this. 
MICHAEL: I can be very suprising. 
MICHAEL: I can do that, it is my office. 
MICHAEL: I can do that. 
MICHAEL: I can do this. 
MICHAEL: I can give you an extra laptop battery. Not everyone took one. How about this? If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay? 
MICHAEL: I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff? 
MICHAEL: I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves. 
MICHAEL: I can just continue to run it myself. 
MICHAEL: I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story. 
MICHAEL: I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly. 
MICHAEL: I can, and I have. 
MICHAEL: I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there. 
MICHAEL: I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why? 
MICHAEL: I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key... 
MICHAEL: I cannot wait to contact your clients. 
MICHAEL: I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that? 
MICHAEL: I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over. 
MICHAEL: I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun 
MICHAEL: I can't believe you're not going to be there. It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man. 
MICHAEL: I can't change anything. This is the way... 
MICHAEL: I can't do the presentation, I can't-   ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God!   
MICHAEL: I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs. 
MICHAEL: I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday? 
MICHAEL: I can't even say it. H-I... 
MICHAEL: I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just... 
MICHAEL: I can't get a stripper here. Sexual Harassment. 
MICHAEL: I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it. 
MICHAEL: I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is... 
MICHAEL: I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe. 
MICHAEL: I can't say. 
MICHAEL: I can't stop myself from kissing her. 
MICHAEL: I can't take it anymore. 
MICHAEL: I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity. 
MICHAEL: I can't tell you. 
MICHAEL: I can't tell you. 
MICHAEL: I can't, I can't... 
MICHAEL: I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea. 
MICHAEL: I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those? 
MICHAEL: I changed it. To Chili's. 
MICHAEL: I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby. 
MICHAEL: I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?" Most colors mean "Don't say it." 
MICHAEL: I could go for an appeteaser. 
MICHAEL: I could have helped. 
MICHAEL: I could have helped. 
MICHAEL: I could have paid for the pizza. 
MICHAEL: I could manage my way around that. 
MICHAEL: I could not have agreed with you more. 
MICHAEL: I could of- Improv 
MICHAEL: I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs. 
MICHAEL: I dare you to. Come on. 
MICHAEL: I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam. 
MICHAEL: I did it!  
MICHAEL: I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all. 
MICHAEL: I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van. David 
MICHAEL: I did not order a stripper. 
MICHAEL: I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity. 
MICHAEL: I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved. 
MICHAEL: I did not, not, not use those words. 
MICHAEL: I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained. 
MICHAEL: I did wave. I did a lot more than wave. 
MICHAEL: I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine. 
MICHAEL: I did! 
MICHAEL: I did! 
MICHAEL: I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael. 
MICHAEL: I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers. 
MICHAEL: I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.  
MICHAEL: I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.  Mi-chael! Mi-chael! 
MICHAEL: I did. 
MICHAEL: I did. And why didn't ya Stanley? 
MICHAEL: I did. I actually put it in your bowl. Bar 
MICHAEL: I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted. 
MICHAEL: I did? 
MICHAEL: I did? 
MICHAEL: I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly. 
MICHAEL: I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush. 
MICHAEL: I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible. 
MICHAEL: I didn't get any agenda. 
MICHAEL: I didn't give you $40. 
MICHAEL: I didn't hear you.  
MICHAEL: I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... I'm just kidding. 
MICHAEL: I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: I didn't mean me! 
MICHAEL: I didn't say anything! 
MICHAEL: I didn't say it to him. I said it about him. 
MICHAEL: I didn't say it, I declared it. 
MICHAEL: I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take. 
MICHAEL: I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up. 
MICHAEL: I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind. 
MICHAEL: I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out. 
MICHAEL: I disagree, I think it was very valuable. 
MICHAEL: I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters. 
MICHAEL: I do not understand what you spend your money on. 
MICHAEL: I do okay. 
MICHAEL: I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping! 
MICHAEL: I do too. 
MICHAEL: I do understand it. 
MICHAEL: I do, too. I do, too. 
MICHAEL: I do, yeah. Big plans. 
MICHAEL: I do. 
MICHAEL: I do. 
MICHAEL: I do. Both of them. 
MICHAEL: I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white. 
MICHAEL: I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating. 
MICHAEL: I do. It's right here.   
MICHAEL: I do. No. I do. I, I want to. Trust me. I really do. 
MICHAEL: I do. She is. 
MICHAEL: I do? Well--Where is that bowl? 
MICHAEL: I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here. 
MICHAEL: I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. "Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself." That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me? Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me. 
MICHAEL: I don't believe I have had the pleasure. Warehouse 
MICHAEL: I don't believe you. 
MICHAEL: I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun. 
MICHAEL: I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it! 
MICHAEL: I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok? 
MICHAEL: I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy. 
MICHAEL: I don't care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon. 
MICHAEL: I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that. 
MICHAEL: I don't either. 
MICHAEL: I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out. Church 
MICHAEL: I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months. 
MICHAEL: I don't feel bad. 
MICHAEL: I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich. 
MICHAEL: I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing. 
MICHAEL: I don't get it. Do I stress you out? 
MICHAEL: I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake. 
MICHAEL: I don't have a girlfriend. 
MICHAEL: I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms. Front Desk 
MICHAEL: I don't have a room? 
MICHAEL: I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers. 
MICHAEL: I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case? 
MICHAEL: I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it. 
MICHAEL: I don't have to tell you anything. 
MICHAEL: I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello? 
MICHAEL: I don't kn-- 
MICHAEL: I don't know about that. 
MICHAEL: I don't know about that. 
MICHAEL: I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it. 
MICHAEL: I don't know if I can trust you anymore. 
MICHAEL: I don't know if I wanna do this. 
MICHAEL: I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just...  
MICHAEL: I don't know that. 
MICHAEL: I don't know what I'm gonna do! 
MICHAEL: I don't know what the  that was. 
MICHAEL: I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour. 
MICHAEL: I don't know what they're made of. 
MICHAEL: I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it. 
MICHAEL: I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. "M" your name is Mark. 
MICHAEL: I don't know, actually. 
MICHAEL: I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin. 
MICHAEL: I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you? 
MICHAEL: I don't know, I don't know about that. 
MICHAEL: I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression--- 
MICHAEL: I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so-- 
MICHAEL: I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here- 
MICHAEL: I don't know, it's just... 
MICHAEL: I don't know, nothin', what's up with you? 
MICHAEL: I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please... 
MICHAEL: I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic.  See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls - 
MICHAEL: I don't know. I haven't decided yet. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. I think so. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. Maybe. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. What? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. Who knows how words are formed. 
MICHAEL: I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back. 
MICHAEL: I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this. 
MICHAEL: I don't like that at all. 
MICHAEL: I don't like that story babe. 
MICHAEL: I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it. 
MICHAEL: I don't mind if I do. 
MICHAEL: I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less. 
MICHAEL: I don't need a representative. 
MICHAEL: I don't need to be friends with Pam. I have plenty of female friends. My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week. 
MICHAEL: I don't need to cheat. 
MICHAEL: I don't need to tell you that. 
MICHAEL: I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok? 
MICHAEL: I don't need your permission. 
MICHAEL: I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay?  The job was not mine to give.  Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies. 
MICHAEL: I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment. 
MICHAEL: I don't romanticize th-  No... 
MICHAEL: I don't see a... price. 
MICHAEL: I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual. 
MICHAEL: I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary. Diane 
MICHAEL: I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter. 
MICHAEL: I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out. 
MICHAEL: I don't think so, no. 
MICHAEL: I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam. 
MICHAEL: I don't think you froze. 
MICHAEL: I don't think... I love it! 
MICHAEL: I don't understand-  Hold on. Sorry.  Yes, Pam. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand why you're so upset. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now? 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it? 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand? 
MICHAEL: I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just...  
MICHAEL: I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask. 
MICHAEL: I don't want Dwight! 
MICHAEL: I don't want her to get away. 
MICHAEL: I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us. 
MICHAEL: I don't want to do that.   All right.   She is going to freak out! 
MICHAEL: I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids. 
MICHAEL: I don't want to say. But, "it's fun to stay at the -"  
MICHAEL: I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you? 
MICHAEL: I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright. 
MICHAEL: I don't, I don't have to have that. 
MICHAEL: I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot? 
MICHAEL: I don't. 
MICHAEL: I don't. 
MICHAEL: I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub. 
MICHAEL: I don't... 
MICHAEL: I don't... okay, just listen. 
MICHAEL: I don't... remember. 
MICHAEL: I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation. 
MICHAEL: I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me. 
MICHAEL: I drove. 
MICHAEL: I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco. 
MICHAEL: I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that. 
MICHAEL: I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something. 
MICHAEL: I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin?  
MICHAEL: I feel you. 
MICHAEL: I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall. 
MICHAEL: I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out.  I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space?  Voila, right in the wall. 
MICHAEL: I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again. 
MICHAEL: I gave it to you in the car. 
MICHAEL: I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to-- 
MICHAEL: I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital. 
MICHAEL: I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just... 
MICHAEL: I got gum in my hair. 
MICHAEL: I got his pants. 
MICHAEL: I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you? 
MICHAEL: I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now... 
MICHAEL: I got it from NewYorkTimes.com 
MICHAEL: I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons.  Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late. 
MICHAEL: I got it on a website, that's not important. 
MICHAEL: I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please! 
MICHAEL: I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap. 
MICHAEL: I got problems Billy. Big problems... 
MICHAEL: I got thirsty. 
MICHAEL: I got thirsty. How'd it go? 
MICHAEL: I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is. 
MICHAEL: I got you... jade earrings. 
MICHAEL: I grab this  , and I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre." 
MICHAEL: I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better. 
MICHAEL: I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that.  
MICHAEL: I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner. 
MICHAEL: I guess this could be the one, huh? 
MICHAEL: I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping? 
MICHAEL: I guess you said something weird about your daughter? 
MICHAEL: I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm. 
MICHAEL: I had a great idea until you ruined it. 
MICHAEL: I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit. I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go. Feeling good. Listen to some tunes. Should've peed before I left. 
MICHAEL: I had rebound? Yeah. 
MICHAEL: I had to do that. 
MICHAEL: I had to make a snap decision Dwight. 
MICHAEL: I had um, one of those danishes. 
MICHAEL: I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy! 
MICHAEL: I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it. 
MICHAEL: I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king. 
MICHAEL: I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men. 
MICHAEL: I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore. 
MICHAEL: I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball? 
MICHAEL: I have a deposit. Alcoholic. 
MICHAEL: I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me. 
MICHAEL: I have a job. 
MICHAEL: I have a laundry machine! 
MICHAEL: I have a new place. 
MICHAEL: I have a special assignment for you. 
MICHAEL: I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week I was at the video store. Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision. 
MICHAEL: I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you. 
MICHAEL: I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works? 
MICHAEL: I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help. 
MICHAEL: I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry? 
MICHAEL: I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house. 
MICHAEL: I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right? 
MICHAEL: I have been a loyal employee for a long time. 
MICHAEL: I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me. 
MICHAEL: I have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever Jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa. 
MICHAEL: I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that? 
MICHAEL: I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him. 
MICHAEL: I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre.  He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is?  Hey. Hi, sorry. 
MICHAEL: I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven." 
MICHAEL: I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some... 
MICHAEL: I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening. 
MICHAEL: I have got big balls. 
MICHAEL: I have herpes. 
MICHAEL: I have herpes. 
MICHAEL: I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story. 
MICHAEL: I have it on good authority that you said the following.  Can you read that back to me? 
MICHAEL: I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is...   working perfectly. 
MICHAEL: I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday.  Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy. 
MICHAEL: I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie. 
MICHAEL: I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you. 
MICHAEL: I have my passport.   David 
MICHAEL: I have my per diem.   I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater. David 
MICHAEL: I have no idea. 
MICHAEL: I have not found that to be the case. 
MICHAEL: I have recently taken a lover. 
MICHAEL: I have rights. 
MICHAEL: I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done. 
MICHAEL: I have to buy another place. 
MICHAEL: I have to fire someone today, okay? 
MICHAEL: I have to hear it from her. 
MICHAEL: I have to know whether you're serious or not. 
MICHAEL: I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce? 
MICHAEL: I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me. 
MICHAEL: I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing... 
MICHAEL: I have work to do. 
MICHAEL: I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief 
MICHAEL: I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine. 
MICHAEL: I haven't signed them, ok? 
MICHAEL: I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua. 
MICHAEL: I haven't told you about her. 
MICHAEL: I hear your voice. 
MICHAEL: I heard a- 
MICHAEL: I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt. Vance Refrigeration 
MICHAEL: I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like? 
MICHAEL: I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am... 
MICHAEL: I hope you're not busy doing something. 
MICHAEL: I hope you're not recording this conversation.   Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles. 
MICHAEL: I humbly accept the management position. 
MICHAEL: I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that... 
MICHAEL: I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys. 
MICHAEL: I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened. 
MICHAEL: I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean, what sort of place is that to call home? And Meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money. 
MICHAEL: I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you? 
MICHAEL: I just don't want you to. 
MICHAEL: I just found out today. It's, uh, right there. 
MICHAEL: I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before. 
MICHAEL: I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food. 
MICHAEL: I just hope that you and I can remain friends. 
MICHAEL: I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing. 
MICHAEL: I just saw him. 
MICHAEL: I just saw this baby daddy- 
MICHAEL: I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos.  And... my question to you  is do you agree? Other 
MICHAEL: I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so... 
MICHAEL: I just want Phyllis to have a great day. Uncle 
MICHAEL: I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio? 
MICHAEL: I just went out for a walk. 
MICHAEL: I just, I fell in love with those kids. and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise. I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education. I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous. 
MICHAEL: I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress. 
MICHAEL: I just... it's terrifying. 
MICHAEL: I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here. 
MICHAEL: I knew it.  
MICHAEL: I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods? 
MICHAEL: I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points? 
MICHAEL: I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous. 
MICHAEL: I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside. 
MICHAEL: I know but I'm still scared I don't know why. 
MICHAEL: I know just he place. 
MICHAEL: I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing. 
MICHAEL: I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts. 
MICHAEL: I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My 
MICHAEL: I know what a flounder is. 
MICHAEL: I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just. 
MICHAEL: I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it. 
MICHAEL: I know what you want to ask me. "Did your mom ever see you naked?" 
MICHAEL: I know where this is goin'. 
MICHAEL: I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile.  Okay. 
MICHAEL: I know you are. Knock, knock. 
MICHAEL: I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman. 
MICHAEL: I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic. 
MICHAEL: I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something. 
MICHAEL: I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight. 
MICHAEL: I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know. 
MICHAEL: I know, here we go. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know, I know. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just- 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. You're right, you're right. 
MICHAEL: I know, it's a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on! 
MICHAEL: I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright? 
MICHAEL: I know, it's unbelievable. 
MICHAEL: I know, it's very, very personal... 
MICHAEL: I know, just sayin'. 
MICHAEL: I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay?   
MICHAEL: I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MICHAEL: I know.  Okay. Alright.  Oh-- God! 
MICHAEL: I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It's this. 
MICHAEL: I know. God! What is that? 
MICHAEL: I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then. 
MICHAEL: I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me. 
MICHAEL: I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom. 
MICHAEL: I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you."   No. 
MICHAEL: I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible. 
MICHAEL: I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here? 
MICHAEL: I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis? 
MICHAEL: I know. I love Counting Crows. 
MICHAEL: I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.  
MICHAEL: I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally. 
MICHAEL: I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again. 
MICHAEL: I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So... 
MICHAEL: I know. So who's next? 
MICHAEL: I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in. Pam's 
MICHAEL: I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says. 
MICHAEL: I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.  
MICHAEL: I know... 
MICHAEL: I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened. 
MICHAEL: I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times. 
MICHAEL: I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time. 
MICHAEL: I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number 
MICHAEL: I lied to myself too. I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s, I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place. 
MICHAEL: I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong. 
MICHAEL: I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice. 
MICHAEL: I like his hair. 
MICHAEL: I like it. 
MICHAEL: I like that, so manager and co-manager. 
MICHAEL: I like, uh... 
MICHAEL: I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper. 
MICHAEL: I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another 
MICHAEL: I looked at the bag. Blood 
MICHAEL: I looked at Wallace and I said "I quit!" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said "You have no idea how high I can fly." 
MICHAEL: I looked straight at the bag. Blood 
MICHAEL: I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion. 
MICHAEL: I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year. 
MICHAEL: I love him. 
MICHAEL: I love it more! 
MICHAEL: I love it! 
MICHAEL: I love it. 
MICHAEL: I love Pad Thai. 
MICHAEL: I love that. I love that face. 
MICHAEL: I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol. 
MICHAEL: I love this woman! 
MICHAEL: I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby.  Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp? 
MICHAEL: I love you guys, so much.  
MICHAEL: I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail. 
MICHAEL: I love you, Jan. 
MICHAEL: I love you. 
MICHAEL: I love you-love you. 
MICHAEL: I made it sterile. 
MICHAEL: I made it with my cheese pita. 
MICHAEL: I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun. 
MICHAEL: I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre. Bar 
MICHAEL: I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other? 
MICHAEL: I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear. 
MICHAEL: I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about. 
MICHAEL: I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion... 
MICHAEL: I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do.   It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental. 
MICHAEL: I might. 
MICHAEL: I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate. 
MICHAEL: I-- mmm-- I'm good. 
MICHAEL: I need clean urine for the lady. 
MICHAEL: I need him gone. 
MICHAEL: I need more time. 
MICHAEL: I need to have her say... 
MICHAEL: I need to have her tell me herself. Right? 
MICHAEL: I need to pee. 
MICHAEL: I need to say, "What the hell is that? What the hell is that?" 
MICHAEL: I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing. 
MICHAEL: I need you to do something for me. 
MICHAEL: I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend. 
MICHAEL: I need your help. This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head. 
MICHAEL: I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard. 
MICHAEL: I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam,  and now I don't wanna lose the baby. 
MICHAEL: I never said you could do that. 
MICHAEL: I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot. 
MICHAEL: I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost? 
MICHAEL: I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting.   It is a disgusting sandwich.   And the reason I tell you this story.   Pick up the phone. 
MICHAEL: I owe you an apology. 
MICHAEL: I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you. 
MICHAEL: I own a Chrysler. Bar 
MICHAEL: I probably will, why do you ask? 
MICHAEL: I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us. 
MICHAEL: I really appreciate it. 
MICHAEL: I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here. 
MICHAEL: I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line. 
MICHAEL: I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll. 
MICHAEL: I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist. 
MICHAEL: I said breathe! 
MICHAEL: I said no. 
MICHAEL: I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer- 
MICHAEL: I said 'was'. 
MICHAEL: I saw you program it in. 
MICHAEL: I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful.   They are beautiful. He is beautiful. This big fat pig is beautiful. 
MICHAEL: I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man!  Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back. 
MICHAEL: I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man! 
MICHAEL: I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So.. 
MICHAEL: I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it. 
MICHAEL: I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time. 
MICHAEL: I sorta like the old way. 
MICHAEL: I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it. 
MICHAEL: I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow. 
MICHAEL: I spy? 
MICHAEL: I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine. 
MICHAEL: I started a fire, I started a fire. 
MICHAEL: I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible.  
MICHAEL: I still have to look at this stuff, guys. 
MICHAEL: I stole a sleeve of her sweater. 
MICHAEL: I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom. 
MICHAEL: I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did. 
MICHAEL: I take Quincy Ave to Gibson. 
MICHAEL: I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus. 
MICHAEL: I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise. 
MICHAEL: I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point. 
MICHAEL: I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience. 
MICHAEL: I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about? 
MICHAEL: I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we? 
MICHAEL: I think he is. 
MICHAEL: I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me. 
MICHAEL: I think I do. 
MICHAEL: I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton. 
MICHAEL: I think I got something pretty nice for my guy. 
MICHAEL: I think I know where he is. 
MICHAEL: I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect.  Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP. 
MICHAEL: I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?  It bothers me that you're not answering the question. 
MICHAEL: I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face.  I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know. 
MICHAEL: I think it is. A guy told me about that. 
MICHAEL: I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan. 
MICHAEL: I think it went well. I think it was good. 
MICHAEL: I think it's going to be any minute now. 
MICHAEL: I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go!  
MICHAEL: I think maybe Hank should be here. 
MICHAEL: I think so. Girl in 2nd 
MICHAEL: I think that is a great way to honor Ed. 
MICHAEL: I think the engineer left. 
MICHAEL: I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have. 
MICHAEL: I think this is going great. 
MICHAEL: I think we could.  
MICHAEL: I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant. 
MICHAEL: I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks? 
MICHAEL: I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company. 
MICHAEL: I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman.  Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands. 
MICHAEL: I think you are wrong. 
MICHAEL: I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk. 
MICHAEL: I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance. 
MICHAEL: I think you should do that.   
MICHAEL: I think you're a nice guy too. 
MICHAEL: I think you're doing a great job. 
MICHAEL: I think you're great. You're my best friend. 
MICHAEL: I think you're over-thinking it. 
MICHAEL: I think you're right. 
MICHAEL: I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here. 
MICHAEL: I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy. 
MICHAEL: I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance. 
MICHAEL: I thought I did. So... 
MICHAEL: I thought it might make me feel better. 
MICHAEL: I thought maybe we could talk after this is over. David 
MICHAEL: I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel. 
MICHAEL: I thought that you might say that.  
MICHAEL: I thought that you were engaged? 
MICHAEL: I thought you had to pee. 
MICHAEL: I thought your name was Pudge? 
MICHAEL: I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo. 
MICHAEL: I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale. 
MICHAEL: I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you. 
MICHAEL: I took a lot from other poems. 
MICHAEL: I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go!  Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white. 
MICHAEL: I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this?  Oscar and 
MICHAEL: I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o. 
MICHAEL: I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance. 
MICHAEL: I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them. 
MICHAEL: I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing. 
MICHAEL: I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless. 
MICHAEL: I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people. 
MICHAEL: I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting "Back to the Future." "Back" because it's on my back and "Future" because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie. Girl in 
MICHAEL: I understand that, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey! 
MICHAEL: I understand. We're all friends. 
MICHAEL: I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong... 
MICHAEL: I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar. 
MICHAEL: I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan. 
MICHAEL: I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos. 
MICHAEL: I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around. 
MICHAEL: I want another try. Here we go!   Thirty-one! Thirty-one! 
MICHAEL: I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.  
MICHAEL: I want it to be like... "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous." "Well, guess what,  that was Michael Scott." "But it was anonymous, how do you know?" "Because I'm him." 
MICHAEL: I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?" 
MICHAEL: I want it... 
MICHAEL: I want my old job back. I want my old parking space back. I want a Sebring. 
MICHAEL: I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive. 
MICHAEL: I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling. 
MICHAEL: I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right. 
MICHAEL: I want to be married and have a hundred kids so I can have a hundred friends, and no one can say no to being my friend. Edward R. 
MICHAEL: I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up.  
MICHAEL: I want to keep those so I can see what I sent. 
MICHAEL: I want to make fun of you right now. 
MICHAEL: I want to see it. 
MICHAEL: I want to see it.   
MICHAEL: I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck. 
MICHAEL: I want you to be me, and I will be Creed. 
MICHAEL: I want you to bring a partner. 
MICHAEL: I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic. 
MICHAEL: I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing. 
MICHAEL: I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine? 
MICHAEL: I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down. 
MICHAEL: I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug.   Mmmmmm. 
MICHAEL: I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you. 
MICHAEL: I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit. 
MICHAEL: I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin. 
MICHAEL: I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it. 
MICHAEL: I want you to rub butter on my foot. 
MICHAEL: I want you to say I'm an alcoholic. 
MICHAEL: I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright? 
MICHAEL: I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch. 
MICHAEL: I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.   
MICHAEL: I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid. 
MICHAEL: I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number. 
MICHAEL: I was breathing. 
MICHAEL: I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone. 
MICHAEL: I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us! 
MICHAEL: I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere. 
MICHAEL: I was in love with you. 
MICHAEL: I was in that marriage arena, though. 
MICHAEL: I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD? 
MICHAEL: I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it. 
MICHAEL: I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop. 
MICHAEL: I was never given a name.     
MICHAEL: I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night. 
MICHAEL: I was probably going to break up with her anyway. 
MICHAEL: I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut. 
MICHAEL: I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it. 
MICHAEL: I was thinking exactly the same thing. 
MICHAEL: I was thinking maybe like a mixer. 
MICHAEL: I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil. 
MICHAEL: I wasn't attempting to compliment you. 
MICHAEL: I wasn't. 
MICHAEL: I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so... 
MICHAEL: I went through Holly's things. 
MICHAEL: I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand. 
MICHAEL: I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company. 
MICHAEL: I will allow it. 
MICHAEL: I will allow that. 
MICHAEL: I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers.   
MICHAEL: I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness. 
MICHAEL: I will call him later with that message. 
MICHAEL: I will call you when it is time.   
MICHAEL: I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump. 
MICHAEL: I will divide and then count to it. 
MICHAEL: I will do all the talking. 
MICHAEL: I will get out. Oh yes, I will. 
MICHAEL: I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today. 
MICHAEL: I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times. 
MICHAEL: I will grab you here anyway.  
MICHAEL: I will have the gabba-gool. 
MICHAEL: I will have to answer. 
MICHAEL: I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer. 
MICHAEL: I will improvise. I will speak from the heart. 
MICHAEL: I will open the door. 
MICHAEL: I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off. Mr. 
MICHAEL: I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer! 
MICHAEL: I will seduce her. 
MICHAEL: I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight.  Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in. 
MICHAEL: I will take care of that. 
MICHAEL: I will take the fall. I did it. Officer 
MICHAEL: I will try to manage my excitement! 
MICHAEL: I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box. 
MICHAEL: I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling. 
MICHAEL: I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom. 
MICHAEL: I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play. 
MICHAEL: I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim? 
MICHAEL: I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad. 
MICHAEL: I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it. 
MICHAEL: I won't 
MICHAEL: I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right? 
MICHAEL: I won't. 
MICHAEL: I won't. Mr. 
MICHAEL: I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear? 
MICHAEL: I would do the same for you. 
MICHAEL: I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean. 
MICHAEL: I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't... You don't call retarded people "retards". It's bad taste. You call your friends "retards" when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend. 
MICHAEL: I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby. 
MICHAEL: I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important... 
MICHAEL: I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage.  Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you. 
MICHAEL: I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.   Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company! 
MICHAEL: I would like to see those please. 
MICHAEL: I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out? 
MICHAEL: I would like you to meet your new boyfriend. 
MICHAEL: I would like your undivided attention, please. 
MICHAEL: I would love a place where we could meet older girls. 
MICHAEL: I would love that. 
MICHAEL: I would love that. 
MICHAEL: I would love that. 
MICHAEL: I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.  OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it. 
MICHAEL: I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry. 
MICHAEL: I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers. 
MICHAEL: I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great   Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left   
MICHAEL: I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy. 
MICHAEL: I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other. 
MICHAEL: I, I need something to wipe my hand. 
MICHAEL: I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike! 
MICHAEL: I, I surely do, and don't call me honey.  You were playing too. 
MICHAEL: I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that  this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid. 
MICHAEL: I, uh, hmm. 
MICHAEL: I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal. 
MICHAEL: I, uh...   I let her win. 
MICHAEL: I, uh... I am going to be a father. 
MICHAEL: I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter. 
MICHAEL: I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself. Let's both. 
MICHAEL: I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay. 
MICHAEL: I. Understand. Nothing. 
MICHAEL: I... 
MICHAEL: I... 
MICHAEL: I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY! 
MICHAEL: I... do not see you. 
MICHAEL: I... don't. 
MICHAEL: I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much. 
MICHAEL: I... I... Yes. 
MICHAEL: I... Just... Would you put it up?  Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner. 
MICHAEL: I... love it!! Haha, come on! 
MICHAEL: I... Okay, okay, okay,   alright, thank you.   
MICHAEL: I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it. 
MICHAEL: I... That was just... 
MICHAEL: I... this is Creed. 
MICHAEL: I... uh, well, I don't know. 
MICHAEL: I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better. 
MICHAEL: I... will skip a turn. 
MICHAEL: I... won't. I won't. 
MICHAEL: I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings. 
MICHAEL: I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica. Second 
MICHAEL: I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled. 
MICHAEL: I'd like to make a wish. 
MICHAEL: I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party. Captain 
MICHAEL: Idiot. 
MICHAEL: Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot. 
MICHAEL: If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already. 
MICHAEL: If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay. 
MICHAEL: If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you? 
MICHAEL: If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you. 
MICHAEL: If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing? 
MICHAEL: If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that. 
MICHAEL: If it's me, then society made me that way. Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?" 
MICHAEL: If she is, it's working. 
MICHAEL: If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming. 
MICHAEL: If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'! Captain 
MICHAEL: If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have? 
MICHAEL: If the salad is on top, I send it back. 
MICHAEL: If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden. 
MICHAEL: If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now. 
MICHAEL: If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no! 
MICHAEL: If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore. 
MICHAEL: If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, "apology accepted", I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark. 
MICHAEL: If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk. 
MICHAEL: If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow. 
MICHAEL: If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus. 
MICHAEL: If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away. 
MICHAEL: If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so... 
MICHAEL: If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this? 
MICHAEL: If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be? 
MICHAEL: If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed. 
MICHAEL: If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody. 
MICHAEL: If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.  
MICHAEL: If you wanna dump me, I totally get it. 
MICHAEL: If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure? I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault. OK well, who else? 
MICHAEL: If you want a truce, I will give you a truce. 
MICHAEL: If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you? 
MICHAEL: If you'll have me, yes. 
MICHAEL: If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout. 
MICHAEL: If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up. Bar 
MICHAEL: If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.  
MICHAEL: Ignorance. Mr. 
MICHAEL: Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick... Billy 
MICHAEL: IHop. 
MICHAEL: I'll be down in just a second.   Holly? 
MICHAEL: I'll be six. 
MICHAEL: I'll call back. 
MICHAEL: I'll call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri. 
MICHAEL: I'll call her later. 
MICHAEL: I'll call him. I'll call David. 
MICHAEL: I'll get it. 
MICHAEL: I'll get some punch. That looks delicious.  
MICHAEL: I'll give you $50. Money's no object. 
MICHAEL: I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards. 
MICHAEL: I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow. 
MICHAEL: I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions... 
MICHAEL: I'll just wave and introduce myself. 
MICHAEL: I'll kill you man! 
MICHAEL: I'll let you in on a little 
MICHAEL: I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you. 
MICHAEL: I'll stay off the grid. 
MICHAEL: I'll take care of that for you.   Thanks. 
MICHAEL: I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road. 
MICHAEL: I'll work on that- 
MICHAEL: I'm a little confused. 'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy. And then it's like all regret. Because "Oh, I regret that." But, "Wait, I'm still gonna call you." But, but, "We're just gonna talk business. And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job." But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business. 
MICHAEL: I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now. 
MICHAEL: I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." 
MICHAEL: I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out. 
MICHAEL: I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay.  
MICHAEL: I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody. 
MICHAEL: I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs. 
MICHAEL: I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back. 
MICHAEL: I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out... 
MICHAEL: I'm an awful guy! Ooh! 
MICHAEL: I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast. 
MICHAEL: I'm asking Holly a question in fire. 
MICHAEL: I'm asking Pam to do it, please. 
MICHAEL: I'm awful, aren't I? 
MICHAEL: I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour. 
MICHAEL: I'm between specialists right now. 
MICHAEL: I'm braver than you? 
MICHAEL: I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him. 
MICHAEL: I'm cool. 
MICHAEL: I'm creative, Ryan. 
MICHAEL: I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. 
MICHAEL: I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up. 
MICHAEL: I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up. 
MICHAEL: I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: I'm glad you told me. 
MICHAEL: I'm goin 'in! 
MICHAEL: I'm going in for a procedure today. 
MICHAEL: I'm going to be.  Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.  Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband. 
MICHAEL: I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend. 
MICHAEL: I'm going to get it. 
MICHAEL: I'm going to give Erin $15. 
MICHAEL: I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault! 
MICHAEL: I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich. 
MICHAEL: I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin... 
MICHAEL: I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.  
MICHAEL: I'm going with Pam's group. 
MICHAEL: I'm gonna have it one of these nights. 
MICHAEL: I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him. 
MICHAEL: I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me. 
MICHAEL: I'm gonna walk away. 
MICHAEL: I'm good, I'm good. 
MICHAEL: I'm good. 
MICHAEL: I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you. 
MICHAEL: I'm good. Oh, my God. 
MICHAEL: I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her. 
MICHAEL: I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex. 
MICHAEL: I'm here.  In a good way! I've been here the whole time. 
MICHAEL: I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants. 
MICHAEL: I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God! 
MICHAEL: I'm improvising, so just try to keep up.  
MICHAEL: I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet. 
MICHAEL: I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop. 
MICHAEL: I'm in. Improv 
MICHAEL: I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa. 
MICHAEL: I'm joking. 
MICHAEL: I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry.  I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek. 
MICHAEL: I'm just calling because you responded positively to the--- 
MICHAEL: I'm just getting hardcore with him. 
MICHAEL: I'm just going to put this over there. 
MICHAEL: I'm just gonna call her. 
MICHAEL: I'm just having a little exit interview. 
MICHAEL: I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point. 
MICHAEL: I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever. 
MICHAEL: I'm just saying, that - 
MICHAEL: I'm just walking around. 
MICHAEL: I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room. 
MICHAEL: I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt. 
MICHAEL: I'm looking for the toy drive box. 
MICHAEL: I'm Michael. We dated for a while. Old 
MICHAEL: I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado. 
MICHAEL: I'm not a bad person, I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college. Okay, all right. 
MICHAEL: I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight? 
MICHAEL: Im not a shark. 
MICHAEL: I'm not better than Josh. 
MICHAEL: I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.  And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground. 
MICHAEL: I'm not changing that, it's the best one. 
MICHAEL: I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act.  Stanley, may I talk to you for a second? 
MICHAEL: I'm not firing somebody on the first day. 
MICHAEL: I'm not following you. 
MICHAEL: I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients. 
MICHAEL: I'm not giving that to you. Pizza 
MICHAEL: I'm not going get a brain- 
MICHAEL: I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces. 
MICHAEL: I'm not going to give it to you. 
MICHAEL: I'm not going to make this call. 
MICHAEL: I'm not going to slam you up against the wall. 
MICHAEL: I'm not gonna answer it 
MICHAEL: I'm not gonna be okay. 
MICHAEL: I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous. 
MICHAEL: I'm not gonna lock my door.  
MICHAEL: I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey. Cherokee 
MICHAEL: I'm not just a middle... man... 
MICHAEL: I'm not kidding. 
MICHAEL: I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want. 
MICHAEL: I'm not listening to music! Video 
MICHAEL: I'm not overwhelmed, Pam. 
MICHAEL: I'm not playing. 
MICHAEL: I'm not really sick.  Nah, I'm good. 
MICHAEL: I'm not saying that's what he said. 
MICHAEL: I'm not sick! I'm burned! 
MICHAEL: I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah. 
MICHAEL: I'm not sure, um, Mountainton? 
MICHAEL: I'm not taking... I'm not taking... 
MICHAEL: I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good. 
MICHAEL: I'm not wearing a wire, so... 
MICHAEL: I'm not worried. 
MICHAEL: I'm not, I'm not getting married. So...   Psych. 
MICHAEL: I'm not... 
MICHAEL: I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B. 
MICHAEL: I'm out of answers Jan. 
MICHAEL: I'm pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California."  What? 
MICHAEL: I'm pretty sure we said slap. 
MICHAEL: I'm putting my bed right over here. 
MICHAEL: I'm really sorry. 
MICHAEL: I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway. 
MICHAEL: I'm right here, I'm right here. 
MICHAEL: I'm right here. 
MICHAEL: I'm right in your crack! 
MICHAEL: I'm Robert Mifflin.   Ah, okay.   
MICHAEL: I'm scared, too. 
MICHAEL: I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place. 
MICHAEL: I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner. 
MICHAEL: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will---- it will be that easy. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat... 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry, sorry. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry.  Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry.  What now? 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry? 
MICHAEL: I'm starting my own paper company. 
MICHAEL: I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: I'm taking one for my lady friend. 
MICHAEL: I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric. 
MICHAEL: I'm texting about you, okay!? 
MICHAEL: I'm the head of the company?! 
MICHAEL: I'm the mistress? 
MICHAEL: I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen. Tom 
MICHAEL: I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone. 
MICHAEL: I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around. 
MICHAEL: I'm too depressed to save the big game Billy. 
MICHAEL: I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes. Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat. 
MICHAEL: I'm trying to think of what we could sell. 
MICHAEL: I'M TRYING! GOD! 
MICHAEL: I'm trying! Video 
MICHAEL: I'm trying! Video 
MICHAEL: I'm turning myself in right now! 
MICHAEL: I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue. 
MICHAEL: I'm unhappy when I'm with her. 
MICHAEL: I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot.  Michael Winslow, anyone? 
MICHAEL: I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it. David 
MICHAEL: I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah. 
MICHAEL: I'm writing one, yeah. Co-Worker 
MICHAEL: I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna... Captain 
MICHAEL: I'm... 
MICHAEL: I'm... what? I didn't 
MICHAEL: In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me. 
MICHAEL: In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose. 
MICHAEL: In business school, Kevin. Business school. 
MICHAEL: In case... in case of what? 
MICHAEL: In front of me. 
MICHAEL: In my condo complex. 
MICHAEL: In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure. 
MICHAEL: In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business. 
MICHAEL: In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened. 
MICHAEL: In terms of land, not population. 
MICHAEL: In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun!  I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy.  Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about. 
MICHAEL: In the dump. 
MICHAEL: In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change. 
MICHAEL: In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this. Mr. 
MICHAEL: In training. 
MICHAEL: In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?  Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry? 
MICHAEL: In your face 
MICHAEL: Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher. 
MICHAEL: Indubitably. 
MICHAEL: In-grown hair. 
MICHAEL: Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail.  
MICHAEL: Insult. 
MICHAEL: Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all.  Yeah? 
MICHAEL: Internet. 
MICHAEL: Introduce yourself. Be polite. 
MICHAEL: Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans? 
MICHAEL: Inventory's at the end of December. 
MICHAEL: Invite them on the tour. 
MICHAEL: Irie. 
MICHAEL: Irrelevant. 
MICHAEL: is a guy that... Bob 
MICHAEL: Is anyone still at the church? 
MICHAEL: Is Gould dead? What uh- 
MICHAEL: Is he alright? 
MICHAEL: Is it a bird? 
MICHAEL: Is it a good plan? 
MICHAEL: Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority." Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you. 
MICHAEL: Is it going to be worth it? 
MICHAEL: Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting. 
MICHAEL: Is it her boobs, or... 
MICHAEL: Is it Stanley? 
MICHAEL: Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded. 
MICHAEL: Is it? 
MICHAEL: Is it? 
MICHAEL: Is Oscar around? 
MICHAEL: Is Packer here? 
MICHAEL: Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her? 
MICHAEL: Is she crazy in bed? 
MICHAEL: Is she not going to like that? 
MICHAEL: Is somebody there? 
MICHAEL: Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind. 
MICHAEL: Is that all you have on her? 
MICHAEL: Is that all you have to say to me? 
MICHAEL: Is that good? 
MICHAEL: Is that good? 
MICHAEL: Is that what we're going for now? "okay?" We used to go for "pretty good." 
MICHAEL: Is that why your wearing makeup today? 
MICHAEL: Is the cool new guy Charles? 
MICHAEL: Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad? 
MICHAEL: Is there another option? 
MICHAEL: Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them? Pretzel 
MICHAEL: Is there no way we can get rid of him? 
MICHAEL: Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there? 
MICHAEL: Is there something that you would like to say to me? 
MICHAEL: Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight... 
MICHAEL: Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust? 
MICHAEL: Is this the tape of me falling? 
MICHAEL: Is who a Michael what? 
MICHAEL: Island living. You know? 
MICHAEL: Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk.  I show you to your desk. 
MICHAEL: Isn't it? 
MICHAEL: Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines? 
MICHAEL: It blows. It blows, man. Gah... 
MICHAEL: It could be badass. Yeah, it will. 
MICHAEL: It could've died of natural causes. So... 
MICHAEL: It did not. 
MICHAEL: It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them. 
MICHAEL: It didn't come up organically. 
MICHAEL: It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens. 
MICHAEL: It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies. 
MICHAEL: It doesn't matter what I know. 
MICHAEL: It had to be done, it had to be done. 
MICHAEL: It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK. 
MICHAEL: It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about. 
MICHAEL: It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms. 
MICHAEL: It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on! 
MICHAEL: It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just-   Hey. 
MICHAEL: It is a colonoscopy. 
MICHAEL: It is a terrible year for love. Pam's 
MICHAEL: It is a tough one. 
MICHAEL: It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together. So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again. 
MICHAEL: It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm. 
MICHAEL: It is Christmas. 
MICHAEL: It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers.  
MICHAEL: It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  Oh my God. Ohhh.  Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, we have a serious problem here.  Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here. 
MICHAEL: It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith. 
MICHAEL: It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one. 
MICHAEL: It is not a waste of our time. 
MICHAEL: It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life. 
MICHAEL: It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise! 
MICHAEL: It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around. 
MICHAEL: It is six a.m.  and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars! 
MICHAEL: It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it... 
MICHAEL: It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies. 
MICHAEL: It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas. 
MICHAEL: It is the "Whitest Sneakers" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on! 
MICHAEL: It is the easy way out. You are not alone. 
MICHAEL: It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist. 
MICHAEL: It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday. 
MICHAEL: It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story. Pizza 
MICHAEL: It is, yes. 
MICHAEL: It is. 
MICHAEL: It is. 
MICHAEL: It is. 
MICHAEL: It is. I'm good. 
MICHAEL: It is. Ok. 
MICHAEL: It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by. 
MICHAEL: It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera. 
MICHAEL: It is? 
MICHAEL: It looks cute though. 
MICHAEL: It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired."  "You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed." It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way.  "You're foir-ed." I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But that's unrealistic, so... 
MICHAEL: It rained. 
MICHAEL: It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice. 
MICHAEL: It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price! 
MICHAEL: It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm. 
MICHAEL: It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people. We have fun.  We just have fun! Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out. Jim's 
MICHAEL: It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled. 
MICHAEL: It was a good idea, though. 
MICHAEL: It was a lot of snap decisions. 
MICHAEL: It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him. 
MICHAEL: It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that. 
MICHAEL: It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight. 
MICHAEL: It was an accident. 
MICHAEL: it was fun. We had a good time. 
MICHAEL: It was great. China. 
MICHAEL: It was hard. I wanted to kiss her. 
MICHAEL: It was insensitive and I am sorry. 
MICHAEL: It was my understanding. 
MICHAEL: It was not, it sucked. David 
MICHAEL: It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing. 
MICHAEL: It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up. 
MICHAEL: It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan. 
MICHAEL: It was so good. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says "Hey mon," everybody says "Hey mon" back. 
MICHAEL: It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly. 
MICHAEL: It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face. 
MICHAEL: It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't. 
MICHAEL: It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier. 
MICHAEL: It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard! 
MICHAEL: It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise. 
MICHAEL: It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000. 
MICHAEL: It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor. 
MICHAEL: It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that. 
MICHAEL: It won't. 
MICHAEL: It worked. 
MICHAEL: It would look good, on my mantle. 
MICHAEL: It-- yep, recently. 
MICHAEL: It, you know what, it really is. 
MICHAEL: It... 
MICHAEL: It... folds up. You've only seen it flat. 
MICHAEL: Italians don't wear pockets. 
MICHAEL: It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn. 
MICHAEL: It'll take like two seconds. 
MICHAEL: It's $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say?  
MICHAEL: It's 4:30 in the morning. Do you know where your kids are? If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do. They're gonna be in this van. With me. Who am I? Nothing to fear. I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route. 
MICHAEL: It's a big red trash compactor! 
MICHAEL: It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it. 
MICHAEL: It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building. 
MICHAEL: It's a deal. 
MICHAEL: It's a deal. 
MICHAEL: It's a fake wheel, dummy. 
MICHAEL: It's a fish. 
MICHAEL: It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay. 
MICHAEL: It's a heart. 
MICHAEL: It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class. 
MICHAEL: It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish? 
MICHAEL: It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about. 
MICHAEL: It's a sophisticated take. 
MICHAEL: It's a surprise. 
MICHAEL: It's about you. It's about you. Go! 
MICHAEL: It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.  
MICHAEL: It's all connected. Shut up.   Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?' 
MICHAEL: It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them. 
MICHAEL: It's all...  OK. 
MICHAEL: It's alright. I can handle it. 
MICHAEL: It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um... 
MICHAEL: It's bad. 
MICHAEL: It's been opened. 
MICHAEL: It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know. 
MICHAEL: It's better than I imagined it! 
MICHAEL: It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.   Okay. Not gonna make this one.   
MICHAEL: It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face. 
MICHAEL: It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place. 
MICHAEL: It's cheaper. 
MICHAEL: It's comfort food, all right?  God. 
MICHAEL: It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be. 
MICHAEL: It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day. 
MICHAEL: It's done.  
MICHAEL: It's drying, it's drying... 
MICHAEL: It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring. 
MICHAEL: It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running. 
MICHAEL: It's European, OK? It's a European cut. 
MICHAEL: It's for your trouble. 
MICHAEL: It's from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me.  
MICHAEL: It's from James Bond. 
MICHAEL: It's frontward's. 
MICHAEL: It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and-- 
MICHAEL: It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed.   Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so   it's not too late. 
MICHAEL: It's gonna be fun. 
MICHAEL: It's got a lot of me. 
MICHAEL: It's Grotti. He's following up. 
MICHAEL: It's Grrrrrrape! Soda. 
MICHAEL: It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith. 
MICHAEL: It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what? 
MICHAEL: It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing. 
MICHAEL: It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby. 
MICHAEL: It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on! 
MICHAEL: It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water. 
MICHAEL: It's Jim, Okay? Yes. 
MICHAEL: It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you? 
MICHAEL: It's just a really important day for me. 
MICHAEL: It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay? 
MICHAEL: It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs---  
MICHAEL: It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour. 
MICHAEL: It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat. 
MICHAEL: It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it. 
MICHAEL: It's like a mock execution. 
MICHAEL: It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here. 
MICHAEL: It's like a time bomb... 
MICHAEL: It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon. 
MICHAEL: It's my sumo suit. I just didn't inflate it all the way. I am so glad that I bought instead of rented. 
MICHAEL: It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives. 
MICHAEL: It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege. 
MICHAEL: It's nice to see you doing so well. 
MICHAEL: It's nice to see you. 
MICHAEL: It's none of your business. 
MICHAEL: It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her. 
MICHAEL: It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party... 
MICHAEL: It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling. 
MICHAEL: It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale. 
MICHAEL: It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows. 
MICHAEL: Its not just a van. 
MICHAEL: It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer--  -- tility. 
MICHAEL: It's not scary. 
MICHAEL: It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle. 
MICHAEL: It's not very well written, but you get the gist. 
MICHAEL: It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good. 
MICHAEL: It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go. 
MICHAEL: It's not... Nevermind. Nothing.  
MICHAEL: It's ok, they're with me. Lab 
MICHAEL: It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing.  No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse.  Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think.  Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice. 
MICHAEL: It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home. 
MICHAEL: It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there. 
MICHAEL: It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew. 
MICHAEL: It's okay. 
MICHAEL: It's okay. 
MICHAEL: It's okay. It's all right. 
MICHAEL: It's okay. It's okay.  Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show. 
MICHAEL: It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or? 
MICHAEL: It's right here on the desk, yeah. 
MICHAEL: It's right in the middle of the paper belt. 
MICHAEL: Its says here that it's a 300ft drop. Man on 
MICHAEL: It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go. 
MICHAEL: It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on. 
MICHAEL: It's surprise Meredith. One, two... 
MICHAEL: It's- that's different. 
MICHAEL: It's the best. It's the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go. 
MICHAEL: It's the European cut. 
MICHAEL: It's the only time he can do it. 2:30 to 3:15. It's going to be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie. Going to be very delicious. 
MICHAEL: It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here. 
MICHAEL: It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok. 
MICHAEL: It's too late. 
MICHAEL: It's totally impossible! 
MICHAEL: It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  Ryan, can you come here a second?  I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar. 
MICHAEL: It's true. 
MICHAEL: It's true. I did. 
MICHAEL: It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone. 
MICHAEL: It's up to you to change his mind. 
MICHAEL: It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens. 
MICHAEL: It's whoever, not whomever. 
MICHAEL: It's... it's one of those two.  
MICHAEL: It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um... 
MICHAEL: It's... That's... 
MICHAEL: I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life. 
MICHAEL: I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird. 
MICHAEL: I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid. 
MICHAEL: I've got an 
MICHAEL: I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper. It's super duper." I don't know, something like that. 
MICHAEL: I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history. 
MICHAEL: I've never framed a man before, have you? 
MICHAEL: I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool. Girl in 2nd 
MICHAEL: I've played it once or twice with Jeff. 
MICHAEL: I've put having a family on hold. 
MICHAEL: I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see. 
MICHAEL: I've written all of it... in my head. Bar 
MICHAEL: I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.   Umm hmm. 
MICHAEL: I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam? 
MICHAEL: I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell. 
MICHAEL: Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony! 
MICHAEL: Jack Blaise. 
MICHAEL: James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn.  
MICHAEL: Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. 
MICHAEL: Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition. Diane 
MICHAEL: Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day. 
MICHAEL: Jan called me about your little meeting! 
MICHAEL: Jan in yet? 
MICHAEL: Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out. 
MICHAEL: Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed; I'm good. I can go home now. 
MICHAEL: Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead. 
MICHAEL: Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex. 
MICHAEL: Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan. 
MICHAEL: Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure? 
MICHAEL: Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam! 
MICHAEL: Jan, you... complete... me. 
MICHAEL: Jan. 
MICHAEL: Jan... Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules. 
MICHAEL: January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this. 
MICHAEL: Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married. 
MICHAEL: Jefferson. 
MICHAEL: Jerk. 
MICHAEL: Jerk.  
MICHAEL: Ji.. why not? C'mon. 
MICHAEL: Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can. 
MICHAEL: Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work. 
MICHAEL: Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever. 
MICHAEL: Jim Halpert. 
MICHAEL: Jim is her husband. 
MICHAEL: Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me. 
MICHAEL: Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don't think so. Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe. 
MICHAEL: Jim it's okay. You can t...  This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you.  It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you.  Oh, he's doing it, okay.  It's okay.  Oh. Okay, are you sure?  That looked like it was going to be good. Alright.  Okay, well. 
MICHAEL: Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here. 
MICHAEL: Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at? 
MICHAEL: Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut!  Whoa! 
MICHAEL: Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one. 
MICHAEL: Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids. 
MICHAEL: Jim, could you come in here please? 
MICHAEL: Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way? 
MICHAEL: Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal. 
MICHAEL: Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that... 
MICHAEL: Jim, Jim.... 
MICHAEL: Jim, please no loopholes. 
MICHAEL: Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley. 
MICHAEL: Jim, they are a poopy.   
MICHAEL: Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it. 
MICHAEL: Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl-- 
MICHAEL: Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now. 
MICHAEL: Jim. 
MICHAEL: Jim. Are you clicking a detonator? 
MICHAEL: Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute? 
MICHAEL: Jim? 
MICHAEL: Jim? Are you? 
MICHAEL: Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself. 
MICHAEL: Jim? Pam? 
MICHAEL: Jim?!?  Oh my God. 
MICHAEL: Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah. 
MICHAEL: Jimbo, last chance to carpool. 
MICHAEL: Jimbo, let's do this thang. 
MICHAEL: Jimbo. 
MICHAEL: Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional? 
MICHAEL: Jo! We were not expecting you! 
MICHAEL: Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job. 
MICHAEL: Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office. 
MICHAEL: Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  ... ha ha ha. 
MICHAEL: Josh Porter, high five.  Bam. 
MICHAEL: Just - sh - 
MICHAEL: Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it. 
MICHAEL: Just a minute. How long do we have to wait? 
MICHAEL: Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you... 
MICHAEL: Just about everyone in this office is single right now. Including me. And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain. Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces. 
MICHAEL: Just amongst ourselves. 
MICHAEL: Just bragging rights. 
MICHAEL: Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company. 
MICHAEL: Just cover up that bald patch. 
MICHAEL: Just crunch 'em. Just crunch 'em please. 
MICHAEL: Just do a cartwheel! 
MICHAEL: Just do it, okay? 
MICHAEL: Just do it, okay? 
MICHAEL: Just do it. 
MICHAEL: Just do your best! I have faith in you. 
MICHAEL: Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him. 
MICHAEL: Just don't say no. 
MICHAEL: Just don't, don't talk- 
MICHAEL: Just drive faster. I want to get back. 
MICHAEL: Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to... 
MICHAEL: Just forget it. 
MICHAEL: Just forget it. Just the urine. 
MICHAEL: Just get in the car. 
MICHAEL: Just give it! 
MICHAEL: Just go out, and come back in. 
MICHAEL: Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes. 
MICHAEL: Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing. 
MICHAEL: Just hit me. You'll see. 
MICHAEL: Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation? 
MICHAEL: Just keep pushing... 
MICHAEL: Just let go. 
MICHAEL: Just let me know who the winner is. Pam and 
MICHAEL: Just make that copy okay? 
MICHAEL: Just making conversation. 
MICHAEL: Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo. 
MICHAEL: Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back. 
MICHAEL: Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later. 
MICHAEL: Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing. 
MICHAEL: Just say the word. 
MICHAEL: Just say you wanna get back together. 
MICHAEL: Just say, "I want to squeeze them." It's code. She'll know what it means. 
MICHAEL: Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean. 
MICHAEL: Just sit down Kelly. 
MICHAEL: Just sit down! 
MICHAEL: Just something I have to do first. 
MICHAEL: Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!! 
MICHAEL: Just stop it.  What's the... oh, whoa!  Where did that come from? 
MICHAEL: Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right? 
MICHAEL: Just the bread, it's fresh baked. 
MICHAEL: Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today. 
MICHAEL: Just wanted to draw a picture of him. 
MICHAEL: Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction. 
MICHAEL: Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out. 
MICHAEL: Just words. Inspiring words.  Not a contender.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley. 
MICHAEL: Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run. 
MICHAEL: Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life? 
MICHAEL: Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so... Prince 
MICHAEL: Just. I need your urine. 
MICHAEL: Just... 
MICHAEL: Just... 
MICHAEL: Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying... 
MICHAEL: Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company. 
MICHAEL: Just... try to be cool. 
MICHAEL: Just-in case. What's your last name? 
MICHAEL: Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot! And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now. 
MICHAEL: Just-what's going on? 
MICHAEL: Kahlua Sombrero, please. 
MICHAEL: Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li. 
MICHAEL: Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah! Todd 
MICHAEL: Kay. 
MICHAEL: Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter. Guy in 
MICHAEL: Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's. 
MICHAEL: Keep simulating. 
MICHAEL: Keep simulating. 
MICHAEL: Keep. 
MICHAEL: Keep. 
MICHAEL: Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. "Schindler's List" parody. ... That's not appropriate, no. 
MICHAEL: Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself? 
MICHAEL: Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha. 
MICHAEL: Kelly? 
MICHAEL: Kev... Nice. Going. 
MICHAEL: Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer. 
MICHAEL: Kevin! 
MICHAEL: Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to? 
MICHAEL: Kevin, do you accept the apology? 
MICHAEL: Kevin, I have something for you. 
MICHAEL: Kevin, stay. 
MICHAEL: Kevin, stay. 
MICHAEL: Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed. 
MICHAEL: Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week? 
MICHAEL: Kevin. Erin would like a few words with you. 
MICHAEL: Kevin. You heard anything yet? 
MICHAEL: Kevin? 
MICHAEL: Kevin? Respect the birthday please. 
MICHAEL: Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved. 
MICHAEL: KGB -   
MICHAEL: Kidding.  Acting! 
MICHAEL: Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright? 
MICHAEL: Kill me... right now. 
MICHAEL: Kind of in the middle of something here. 
MICHAEL: Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth. 
MICHAEL: Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would 
MICHAEL: Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee. 
MICHAEL: Kuhhhh... you are such a racist. 
MICHAEL: La la la, hello Oscar! 
MICHAEL: La telefona. 
MICHAEL: Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance.  Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! 
MICHAEL: Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time. 
MICHAEL: Ladies and gentleman, Threat 
MICHAEL: Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85.  
MICHAEL: Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute! 
MICHAEL: Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay!  Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend! 
MICHAEL: Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or... 
MICHAEL: Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance! 
MICHAEL: Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car. 
MICHAEL: Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back. 
MICHAEL: Last gift. Kevin. 
MICHAEL: Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney." 
MICHAEL: Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam? 
MICHAEL: Later guys.  
MICHAEL: Lay them on me. What? 
MICHAEL: Leader... ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork! 
MICHAEL: Leave it at reception. 
MICHAEL: Leave me al-- 
MICHAEL: Leaving Pennsylvania. 
MICHAEL: Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson? 
MICHAEL: Let go, let go of me! 
MICHAEL: Let go, please. Just gimmee - 
MICHAEL: Let me ask you- 
MICHAEL: Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning? Billy 
MICHAEL: Let me ask you something. 
MICHAEL: Let me get your stroller. 
MICHAEL: Let me getcha. 
MICHAEL: Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue.  Oh, God! You guys are pathetic. 
MICHAEL: Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em. 
MICHAEL: Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar. 
MICHAEL: Lethal Weapon? 
MICHAEL: Let's celebrate. Mr. 
MICHAEL: Let's cut it.  
MICHAEL: Let's do it! 
MICHAEL: Let's do it! Drop that sucker. 
MICHAEL: Let's do that. 
MICHAEL: Let's do this. 
MICHAEL: Let's do. 
MICHAEL: Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked. 
MICHAEL: Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton". 
MICHAEL: Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm. 
MICHAEL: Let's get back to the matter at hand. 
MICHAEL: Let's get back together.  
MICHAEL: Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise. 
MICHAEL: Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you!  
MICHAEL: Let's go in here. 
MICHAEL: Let's go mini-golfing. 
MICHAEL: Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Let's go! 
MICHAEL: Let's go! 
MICHAEL: Let's go, come on.  God! 
MICHAEL: Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out. 
MICHAEL: Let's go. 
MICHAEL: Let's go. 
MICHAEL: Let's go.  I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her. 
MICHAEL: Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway. 
MICHAEL: Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go. 
MICHAEL: Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go! 
MICHAEL: Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man. 
MICHAEL: Let's hear it. 
MICHAEL: Let's just clap. Ready?  Yeah! Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow. 
MICHAEL: Let's see... 
MICHAEL: Let's send up Accounting. 
MICHAEL: Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know? 
MICHAEL: Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then... 
MICHAEL: Let's, yes? 
MICHAEL: Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons? 
MICHAEL: Liar! 
MICHAEL: Lifeline. 
MICHAEL: Life-size. 
MICHAEL: Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga- 
MICHAEL: Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't... 
MICHAEL: Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys. 
MICHAEL: Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top. 
MICHAEL: Like it. 
MICHAEL: Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary? 
MICHAEL: Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us? 
MICHAEL: Like the movie. 
MICHAEL: Like the witness protection program. 
MICHAEL: Like umm... ten minutes? 
MICHAEL: Like you're applying for a loan. 
MICHAEL: Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a "Where's Waldo."  
MICHAEL: Like, with who? 
MICHAEL: Like... I don't... I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Line it up Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: Line. 
MICHAEL: Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea. 
MICHAEL: Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda? 
MICHAEL: Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them! 
MICHAEL: Listen to me. I like you so much. 
MICHAEL: Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind. 
MICHAEL: Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small. 
MICHAEL: Listen, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Listen, I can't make you laugh right now. 
MICHAEL: Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in "Raw," and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in "Daddy Daycare." both great movies, but, still. 
MICHAEL: Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want. 
MICHAEL: Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now. 
MICHAEL: Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability. 
MICHAEL: Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals. 
MICHAEL: Live and let live. 
MICHAEL: Long story 
MICHAEL: Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race."  And you guys are the retired marines.  And you guys are the mother and daughter.  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go? 
MICHAEL: Look- 
MICHAEL: Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch. 
MICHAEL: Look at him, he's laughing. 
MICHAEL: Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans... 
MICHAEL: Look at his face! Look at his face! 
MICHAEL: Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen. 
MICHAEL: Look at that!  That is the inside of your vagina!  
MICHAEL: Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground! 
MICHAEL: Look at that. 
MICHAEL: Look at that.   Unh. Unh-unh. 
MICHAEL: Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good. 
MICHAEL: Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors. 
MICHAEL: Look at that. Triple your investment by January. 
MICHAEL: Look at the ass. Check out the ass. 
MICHAEL: Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party. 
MICHAEL: Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be? 
MICHAEL: Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot. 
MICHAEL: Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man... 
MICHAEL: Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related? 
MICHAEL: Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look? 
MICHAEL: Look who you're talking to. 
MICHAEL: Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'... 
MICHAEL: Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song. 
MICHAEL: Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug. 
MICHAEL: Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes--- 
MICHAEL: Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it. 
MICHAEL: Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag. 
MICHAEL: Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two 
MICHAEL: Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay? 
MICHAEL: Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings. 
MICHAEL: Look, my clothes are so wet! 
MICHAEL: Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship. 
MICHAEL: Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here. They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter. They are treated like human beings.   
MICHAEL: Look, we want you back. 
MICHAEL: Look... 
MICHAEL: Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier. 
MICHAEL: Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness. 
MICHAEL: Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good. 
MICHAEL: Love you, as a friend. 
MICHAEL: Lowest in town. Financial 
MICHAEL: Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other. 
MICHAEL: Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no!  Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it! 
MICHAEL: Luke is my nephew. 
MICHAEL: Lurk much?  I miss Pam. 
MICHAEL: Lynn was as hot as Erin. 
MICHAEL: Lynn, follow me, come on in. For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone. Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self. 
MICHAEL: M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't... 
MICHAEL: MACGRUBER! Todd 
MICHAEL: MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.  Can he do it? I don't see how he can. 
MICHAEL: Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis.   Pump it! 
MICHAEL: Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out.  I can also make it the sky. 
MICHAEL: MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES! 
MICHAEL: Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award. 
MICHAEL: Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry.  
MICHAEL: Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away. 
MICHAEL: Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators. 
MICHAEL: Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty. Phone 
MICHAEL: Manuel who? 
MICHAEL: Many women are competent drivers.  OK. Come on. 
MICHAEL: March 17th. Diane 
MICHAEL: Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me? 
MICHAEL: Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black. 
MICHAEL: Maxim? American Way? Cracked? 
MICHAEL: May God guide you in your quest. 
MICHAEL: May I enter the room? 
MICHAEL: May I have a word with you in my office please? 
MICHAEL: May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now. 
MICHAEL: Maybe because she's my girlfriend.  Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and... 
MICHAEL: Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine. 
MICHAEL: Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo. 
MICHAEL: Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend? 
MICHAEL: Maybe I'll stay. 
MICHAEL: Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.  
MICHAEL: Maybe neither. 
MICHAEL: Maybe some Italian.  "... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -"  Chinese?  "who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy." 
MICHAEL: Maybe that-- 
MICHAEL: Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em. 
MICHAEL: Maybe they are shrinking. 
MICHAEL: Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or... 
MICHAEL: Maybe wee find some wiggle room? 
MICHAEL: Maybe! 
MICHAEL: Maybe, I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work. 
MICHAEL: Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game. 
MICHAEL: Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle? 
MICHAEL: Maybe. 
MICHAEL: Maybe. 
MICHAEL: Maybe. 
MICHAEL: Maybe. 
MICHAEL: Maybe. 
MICHAEL: Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her. 
MICHAEL: Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it? 
MICHAEL: Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing? 
MICHAEL: Me too, me too. Is this wine? 
MICHAEL: Me too. 
MICHAEL: Me too.   We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch. 
MICHAEL: Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight. 
MICHAEL: Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight? 
MICHAEL: Me? Okay. 
MICHAEL: Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet. 
MICHAEL: Meh, exactly. Eh. 
MICHAEL: Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... . No. 
MICHAEL: Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair. Alright, I'll let you guys talk. 
MICHAEL: Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind? 
MICHAEL: Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi. 
MICHAEL: Meredith, we are doing this for your own good. Okay. Come on-- 
MICHAEL: Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around. 
MICHAEL: Merry Christmas! 
MICHAEL: Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle. 
MICHAEL: Mhhmm! We would be married. 
MICHAEL: Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom. 
MICHAEL: Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that. 
MICHAEL: M-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Michael I gave you a ride home last week, we spent an hour in traffic... 
MICHAEL: Michael Scarn. 
MICHAEL: Michael Scott Paper Company only. 
MICHAEL: Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace. I believe we're expected.   Well, well, well. How the turntables... 
MICHAEL: Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: Michael Scott. Ad guy 
MICHAEL: Midnight, Oscar! Don't worry, Kelly will be training you first. 
MICHAEL: Milk and sugar. 
MICHAEL: Million dollars!

MICHAEL: Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?

MICHAEL: Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me. 
MICHAEL: Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?

MICHAEL: Mm!   Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy. 
MICHAEL: Mm, no... 
MICHAEL: Mm, nope. Don't like that. 
MICHAEL: Mm, that sounds great, actually. 
MICHAEL: Mm, the Big Apple. 
MICHAEL: Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different. 
MICHAEL: Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started. 
MICHAEL: Mm. mm. Oh well. 
MICHAEL: Mm. That's not gonna happen. 
MICHAEL: Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.  
MICHAEL: Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear. 
MICHAEL: Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so. 
MICHAEL: Mm-do... Dwight would not- 
MICHAEL: Mmhm! 
MICHAEL: Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.

MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Mm-Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Mm-Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Mmhmm. Larry 
MICHAEL: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right.  Okay, I'll talk to you later. 
MICHAEL: Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh. Hayworth's 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm? 
MICHAEL: Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it. 
MICHAEL: MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show. 
MICHAEL: Mmm! 
MICHAEL: Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots. Sweeney 
MICHAEL: Mmm! It's after midnight.  Michael and 
MICHAEL: Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe. 
MICHAEL: Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office? 
MICHAEL: Mmm, what flavour coffee is that? Up-dog? 
MICHAEL: Mmm. 
MICHAEL: Mmm. 
MICHAEL: Mmm. 
MICHAEL: Mmm.  
MICHAEL: Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please? 
MICHAEL: Mmm. Okay.  
MICHAEL: Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys. 
MICHAEL: Mmm... 
MICHAEL: Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh? 
MICHAEL: Mmm... No. That was Yoda. 
MICHAEL: Mmm... okay. 
MICHAEL: Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats. 
MICHAEL: Mmmhmm. 
MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm. Front Desk 
MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm. I know. 
MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm. Saunas. 
MICHAEL: Mmmhmm. Yes. 
MICHAEL: Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer. 
MICHAEL: Mmmhmmm. Todd 
MICHAEL: Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great! 
MICHAEL: Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary... 
MICHAEL: Mmmm, sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.  
MICHAEL: Mm-mm. Todd Packer. 
MICHAEL: Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay.  Ryan how are you today? 
MICHAEL: Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Mmmm-My mission is stated as 
MICHAEL: Mmwa. Mmwa. 
MICHAEL: Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were- 
MICHAEL: Mom, I'm getting married. 
MICHAEL: Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon? 
MICHAEL: MONEY! 
MICHAEL: Monkey pee all over you. 
MICHAEL: Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems? 
MICHAEL: Monkey see, monkey do. 
MICHAEL: Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park... 
MICHAEL: Moon each other. 
MICHAEL: More than a friend, a co-worker. 
MICHAEL: More Tylenol. 
MICHAEL: Mornin'.  So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And...  
MICHAEL: Morning Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through. 
MICHAEL: Morning, honey-pile. 
MICHAEL: Morning, Pam. Hey. 
MICHAEL: Morning. 
MICHAEL: Morning. 
MICHAEL: Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story. 
MICHAEL: Most do in the magazines. 
MICHAEL: Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues! 
MICHAEL: Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal. 
MICHAEL: Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates. 
MICHAEL: Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal? 
MICHAEL: Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door.   
MICHAEL: Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really. 
MICHAEL: Music... 
MICHAEL: Must be hackers. 
MICHAEL: Mwah!  Todd 
MICHAEL: My biggest fear is turning into him. 
MICHAEL: My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been  swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual. 
MICHAEL: My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery... 
MICHAEL: My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus.  
MICHAEL: My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for? 
MICHAEL: My gift is forthcoming, Pam. 
MICHAEL: My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds.   That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice... 
MICHAEL: My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much? 
MICHAEL: My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea.   That...   
MICHAEL: My heart says... 
MICHAEL: My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight. 
MICHAEL: My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama. 
MICHAEL: My last pay check? 
MICHAEL: My lips are sealed.  My lips are sealed... Bangles. 
MICHAEL: My lord my liege. 
MICHAEL: My main concern, should I have a safe word? 
MICHAEL: My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny? 
MICHAEL: My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company. Prince 
MICHAEL: My other boss, Mr. Figaro. 
MICHAEL: My plan-- a man-- panama. 
MICHAEL: My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right? 
MICHAEL: My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA. 
MICHAEL: My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully. 
MICHAEL: My respect.  Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups - 
MICHAEL: my weekend was bad so far. Pam's 
MICHAEL: My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight. 
MICHAEL: My whole life, I have known two 
MICHAEL: My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy. 
MICHAEL: N- 
MICHAEL: N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim? 
MICHAEL: Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser. 
MICHAEL: Na? 
MICHAEL: Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job. 
MICHAEL: Nah, he's an ass. 
MICHAEL: Nah, I'm almost done. 
MICHAEL: Nah, I'm okay. 
MICHAEL: Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb 
MICHAEL: Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours. Second 
MICHAEL: Nah. 
MICHAEL: Nah.   Bowling. 
MICHAEL: Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here. 
MICHAEL: Nana.   I really think that Papa would want you to do this. 
MICHAEL: Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having sex with Jan-- 
MICHAEL: Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes. 
MICHAEL: Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos. 
MICHAEL: Nerd. That is why you're not on the team. 
MICHAEL: Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer? 
MICHAEL: Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base. 
MICHAEL: Never get's any of my jokes. 
MICHAEL: Never missed a day, my ass. 
MICHAEL: NEVER!  Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl. 
MICHAEL: Never, ever, ever give up. 
MICHAEL: Never. 
MICHAEL: Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking-- 
MICHAEL: Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves. 
MICHAEL: New York. Wanna go? 
MICHAEL: Newspapers for sale! 
MICHAEL: Next person on the... 
MICHAEL: Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere. 
MICHAEL: Nice beaches, pristine beaches? 
MICHAEL: Nice dress, Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Nice outfit. 
MICHAEL: Nice to have Oscar back. 
MICHAEL: Nice to meet you too. 
MICHAEL: Nice to meet you. 
MICHAEL: Nice to meet you. 
MICHAEL: Nice to meet you. Mr. 
MICHAEL: Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent. 
MICHAEL: Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome. 
MICHAEL: Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again. 
MICHAEL: Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index? Business Student 
MICHAEL: Nice! 
MICHAEL: Nice! We're gonna calm down later. 
MICHAEL: Nice, Stanley! 
MICHAEL: Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs. One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company--- Mr. 
MICHAEL: Night Erin. 
MICHAEL: Nine dates. I said it on the second date. 
MICHAEL: Nine days, though. That's, like... 
MICHAEL: Nine dollars. The boys' department. 
MICHAEL: Nn--- Depression. 
MICHAEL: N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude. 
MICHAEL: NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS! 
MICHAEL: No antigravity machine, huh? 
MICHAEL: No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died. 
MICHAEL: No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind. 
MICHAEL: No do it, do it. I dare you. 
MICHAEL: No Dwight, not everything is a threat. 
MICHAEL: No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen. 
MICHAEL: No Gould? 
MICHAEL: No he did not. I don't need his permission. 
MICHAEL: No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine. 
MICHAEL: No I didn't, just please don't... 
MICHAEL: No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah. 
MICHAEL: No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God! 
MICHAEL: No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim? 
MICHAEL: No I'm staying. 
MICHAEL: No is not an option. 
MICHAEL: No it ain't. 
MICHAEL: No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying.  
MICHAEL: No it is not. 
MICHAEL: No it isn't. 
MICHAEL: No it's not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, what's your name? 
MICHAEL: No it's not. 
MICHAEL: No it's not. 
MICHAEL: No it's not. 
MICHAEL: No it's not.  It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it. 
MICHAEL: No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto--- 
MICHAEL: No it's okay, we're talking code. 
MICHAEL: No kidding. 
MICHAEL: No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong. And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways. From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others. And the bottom line, I am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy. 
MICHAEL: No Michael here, my name is- 
MICHAEL: No more brain damage! 
MICHAEL: No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily. 
MICHAEL: No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out! 
MICHAEL: No need for consternation, everything is under control. 
MICHAEL: No no no no no no no.  I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue. Here we go. Voice on CD 
MICHAEL: No no no no no no! 
MICHAEL: No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.  
MICHAEL: No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud. 
MICHAEL: No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me? 
MICHAEL: No no no, let me see.  Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em.   
MICHAEL: No no no, no, new suit, please. 
MICHAEL: No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay? 
MICHAEL: No no no. The only signal that I am sending 
MICHAEL: No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call? 
MICHAEL: No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go. 
MICHAEL: No no, we are fine. You have done enough already. 
MICHAEL: No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight.  No, time out, time out.  Time in! 
MICHAEL: No one had a problem with the air here until you came around. 
MICHAEL: No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull. 
MICHAEL: No one's even going to notice. 
MICHAEL: No problem.  
MICHAEL: No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy's night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys. 
MICHAEL: No problem. Worth a try. 
MICHAEL: No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again. 
MICHAEL: No reason. 
MICHAEL: No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party... 
MICHAEL: No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops? 
MICHAEL: No sales topic per se. 
MICHAEL: No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza! 
MICHAEL: No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good. 
MICHAEL: No this is Holly. 
MICHAEL: No this is Holly. 
MICHAEL: No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you. 
MICHAEL: No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic. 
MICHAEL: No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello.   Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you! 
MICHAEL: No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen! Todd 
MICHAEL: No-- We don't have-- 
MICHAEL: No--- We're all unstable. 
MICHAEL: No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh. 
MICHAEL: No you ahh. 
MICHAEL: No you didn't. 
MICHAEL: No you would not. 
MICHAEL: No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half. 
MICHAEL: No you're not. 
MICHAEL: NO! 
MICHAEL: No! 
MICHAEL: No! 
MICHAEL: No! 
MICHAEL: No! 
MICHAEL: No! 
MICHAEL: No! 
MICHAEL: No! 
MICHAEL: No!  God. 
MICHAEL: No! Better! 
MICHAEL: No! God!  
MICHAEL: No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again! 
MICHAEL: No! Gosh! Dwight.  Stop it, stop it! Stop it. 
MICHAEL: No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue. 
MICHAEL: No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas. 
MICHAEL: No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay? Pizza 
MICHAEL: No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger. 
MICHAEL: No! It was like four years ago! 
MICHAEL: No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or-- 
MICHAEL: No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs. 
MICHAEL: No! No way! It... no. 
MICHAEL: No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was? 
MICHAEL: No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't? 
MICHAEL: No! Oh my God! 
MICHAEL: No! Okay.  All right. 
MICHAEL: No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse. 
MICHAEL: No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie. 
MICHAEL: No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree. 
MICHAEL: No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody "faggie". Why would anybody find that offensive? 
MICHAEL: No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh!  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted. 
MICHAEL: No! You can't have any candy! 
MICHAEL: No! You idiot!   Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.   
MICHAEL: No!! Come on, gimme something good! 
MICHAEL: No, a new copier!   Unless everybody can agree on something better? 
MICHAEL: No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that. 
MICHAEL: No, Baah! But he's married to her! 
MICHAEL: No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over. 
MICHAEL: No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it. 
MICHAEL: No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?"   Yeah. 
MICHAEL: No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber. 
MICHAEL: No, David. You listen to me. Why did you send her away? That--- God. You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man. Dacvid 
MICHAEL: No, did you? 
MICHAEL: No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said? 
MICHAEL: No, don't worry, the chain is off. 
MICHAEL: No, don't! 
MICHAEL: No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic.   You? 
MICHAEL: No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation. 
MICHAEL: No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer. 
MICHAEL: No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me. 
MICHAEL: No, God! No, no, oh, my God! 
MICHAEL: No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!? 
MICHAEL: No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck. 
MICHAEL: No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head. 
MICHAEL: No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage. 
MICHAEL: No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded? 
MICHAEL: No, he's not. 
MICHAEL: No, he's not. 
MICHAEL: No, he's not.  
MICHAEL: No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific. 
MICHAEL: No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby. 
MICHAEL: No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right? 
MICHAEL: No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero! 
MICHAEL: No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager. 
MICHAEL: No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending. 
MICHAEL: No, I didn't.  Huh, what?  
MICHAEL: No, I didn't. You misconstrued me. 
MICHAEL: No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin. 
MICHAEL: No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important. 
MICHAEL: No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot. 
MICHAEL: No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway. 
MICHAEL: No, I don't want to wear a bra. 
MICHAEL: No, I don't! 
MICHAEL: No, I don't. 
MICHAEL: No, I don't. 
MICHAEL: No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me. 
MICHAEL: No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend. 
MICHAEL: No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say? 
MICHAEL: No, I got it. 
MICHAEL: No, I got that. 
MICHAEL: No, I gotta go. Text me later. 
MICHAEL: No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that. 
MICHAEL: No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible. 
MICHAEL: No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show. 
MICHAEL: No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready? 
MICHAEL: No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious. 
MICHAEL: No, I insist. After me. Male church 
MICHAEL: No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit. 
MICHAEL: No, I like the attention. Is she here yet? 
MICHAEL: No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS. 
MICHAEL: No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room. 
MICHAEL: No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people. 
MICHAEL: No, I think it is- 
MICHAEL: No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry. 
MICHAEL: No, I think they're talking about me. 
MICHAEL: No, I think you're cutting in line. 
MICHAEL: No, I want you to pick me up. 
MICHAEL: No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in... 
MICHAEL: No, I wasn't, I didn't cry- 
MICHAEL: No, I will ex-squeeze you. 
MICHAEL: No, I will seduce her. 
MICHAEL: No, I will. 
MICHAEL: No, I won't even consider it. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm a regional manager--- 
MICHAEL: No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on! 
MICHAEL: No, I'm not going to settle down. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs? 
MICHAEL: No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette  We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm sure that's not. Na... 
MICHAEL: No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm team captain. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm whipping them. 
MICHAEL: No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it. 
MICHAEL: No, it is not. 
MICHAEL: No, it said right, it said take a right. 
MICHAEL: No, it was a tough audience. 
MICHAEL: No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real. 
MICHAEL: No, it will not be. I am on top of it. David 
MICHAEL: No, it... Yes, okay, right.  All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go.  
MICHAEL: No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on! 
MICHAEL: No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs. 
MICHAEL: No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids. 
MICHAEL: No, it's in like ten minutes. 
MICHAEL: No, it's just us. 
MICHAEL: No, it's Michael Scott. Bar 
MICHAEL: No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the... 
MICHAEL: No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself. 
MICHAEL: No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No. 
MICHAEL: No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it. 
MICHAEL: No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that. 
MICHAEL: No, it's not. 
MICHAEL: No, it's not. It's lower, so... 
MICHAEL: No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay. 
MICHAEL: No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time. 
MICHAEL: No, I've seen the video. 
MICHAEL: No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today. 
MICHAEL: No, Jim brings in money. 
MICHAEL: No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you! 
MICHAEL: No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it. 
MICHAEL: No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'. 
MICHAEL: No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup. 
MICHAEL: No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously. 
MICHAEL: No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy. 
MICHAEL: No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason. 
MICHAEL: No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though. 
MICHAEL: No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe... 
MICHAEL: No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me. 
MICHAEL: No, never heard of it. No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble. 
MICHAEL: No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK? 
MICHAEL: No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid.  
MICHAEL: No, no no no no. Police Officer 
MICHAEL: No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaica's largest fresh water pool. 
MICHAEL: No, no no no... No, no. 
MICHAEL: No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal. 
MICHAEL: No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad. 
MICHAEL: No, no no. 
MICHAEL: No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity! 
MICHAEL: No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out. Pizza 
MICHAEL: No, no you're wrong about this. 
MICHAEL: No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there.  
MICHAEL: No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building! 
MICHAEL: No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience. 
MICHAEL: No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this. 
MICHAEL: No, no, I can do this. 
MICHAEL: No, no, I don't, but--- 
MICHAEL: No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP. 
MICHAEL: No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down? 
MICHAEL: No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right.   Okay... okay. 
MICHAEL: No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises. 
MICHAEL: No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no! 
MICHAEL: No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no! Seriously, I don't mind sharing. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no! This is the performance of your life! 
MICHAEL: No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual.  We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question? 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so... 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, means please don't. Please. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no, no. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling-   I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape? 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody? 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party. Phyllis, Meredith, Michael, 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and... Second 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo? 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace.  I will call David Wallace. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish.  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans! 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no... no, no... 
MICHAEL: No, no, no.... 
MICHAEL: No, no, not real bombs. 
MICHAEL: No, no, really not necessary. 
MICHAEL: No, no, ridiculous. 
MICHAEL: No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope. 
MICHAEL: No, no, that doesn't make any sense. 
MICHAEL: No, no, title change only. 
MICHAEL: No, no, Toby. No. 
MICHAEL: No, no, turn it around. 
MICHAEL: No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this. 
MICHAEL: No, No. 
MICHAEL: No, no. 
MICHAEL: No, no. 
MICHAEL: No, no. Bar 
MICHAEL: No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam.  What a nice guy. 
MICHAEL: No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly. 
MICHAEL: No, no. I celebrate privately. 
MICHAEL: No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo. 
MICHAEL: No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent. 
MICHAEL: No, no. I just needed to hear your voice. 
MICHAEL: No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference. 
MICHAEL: No, no. No. 
MICHAEL: No, no. Salesmen and profit centers. Captain 
MICHAEL: No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa. 
MICHAEL: No, no. That is right now. 
MICHAEL: No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not.  Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao.  Adios! 
MICHAEL: No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.'  I won't say that. I'll something like that. 
MICHAEL: No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now. 
MICHAEL: No, no. What do I do? 
MICHAEL: No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us. 
MICHAEL: No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time. 
MICHAEL: No, no. You're done. 
MICHAEL: No, no... 
MICHAEL: No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you? 
MICHAEL: No, not at all. Nope, come on. 
MICHAEL: No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it? 
MICHAEL: No, not right now. 
MICHAEL: No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles. 
MICHAEL: No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news. 
MICHAEL: No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I.  No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So. 
MICHAEL: No, nothing like that at all. 
MICHAEL: No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer? 
MICHAEL: No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye. 
MICHAEL: No, okay... I've had enough of you. 
MICHAEL: No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves. 
MICHAEL: No, please, please... 
MICHAEL: No, Really? 
MICHAEL: No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs. 
MICHAEL: No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk! 
MICHAEL: No, seriously. 
MICHAEL: No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it. 
MICHAEL: No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing. 
MICHAEL: No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin. 
MICHAEL: No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go. 
MICHAEL: No, that was a different hundred dollar bill. 
MICHAEL: No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act. 
MICHAEL: No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that. 
MICHAEL: No, that was... that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate. Police Officer 
MICHAEL: No, that wouldn't- 
MICHAEL: No, that wouldn't be-- 
MICHAEL: No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy. 
MICHAEL: No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in.  No body go in there. Stay where you are. 
MICHAEL: No, that's not it. 
MICHAEL: No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you. 
MICHAEL: No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say. 
MICHAEL: No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do. 
MICHAEL: No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it... 
MICHAEL: No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins. 
MICHAEL: No, they can't. 
MICHAEL: No, they don't. See?  
MICHAEL: No, they must have class. 
MICHAEL: No, they're just hotties. 
MICHAEL: No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars! 
MICHAEL: No, this is a power suit. 
MICHAEL: No, this is geological. 
MICHAEL: No, this is my quest. 
MICHAEL: No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape. 
MICHAEL: No, this is romantic. 
MICHAEL: No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work. 
MICHAEL: No, today at work. 
MICHAEL: No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs." 
MICHAEL: No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... 
MICHAEL: No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim. 
MICHAEL: No, we can't. 
MICHAEL: No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it. 
MICHAEL: No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks. 
MICHAEL: No, we have to cancel the party. 
MICHAEL: No, we know. Texas! 
MICHAEL: No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam. 
MICHAEL: NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus. 
MICHAEL: No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back. 
MICHAEL: No, what did you say? 
MICHAEL: No, what happened with Donna? 
MICHAEL: No, whomever is never actually right. 
MICHAEL: No, why? Why would I... ? You could... 
MICHAEL: No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice?  A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite.  
MICHAEL: No, you are remembering it wrong. 
MICHAEL: No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here. 
MICHAEL: No, you don't have to do that. 
MICHAEL: No, you don't. No, it -   What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right? 
MICHAEL: No, you get outta here. 
MICHAEL: No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room. 
MICHAEL: No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think. 
MICHAEL: No, you lost those clients. 
MICHAEL: No, you may not. 
MICHAEL: No, you may not. 
MICHAEL: No, you shut up. Bar 
MICHAEL: No, you shut up. They need this game, Jim. Let us have this stupid little game, alright?  
MICHAEL: No, you wanna leave. 
MICHAEL: No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right? 
MICHAEL: No, you--no. 
MICHAEL: No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God! 
MICHAEL: No, You're not going to collect them. 
MICHAEL: No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it. 
MICHAEL: No, you're supposed to say, "Rock the house." 
MICHAEL: No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No. 
MICHAEL: No.  
MICHAEL: No.   
MICHAEL: No.   Yes, I am sure, Jim. It -- 
MICHAEL: No.  Saving the world has never been this hard. 
MICHAEL: No.  We're trying to look it up right now. 
MICHAEL: No. Absolutely not. 
MICHAEL: No. Actually the trip sucked. David 
MICHAEL: No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go.  
MICHAEL: No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior. 
MICHAEL: No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid. 
MICHAEL: No. Don't like that. 
MICHAEL: No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco. 
MICHAEL: No. Dwight. I'm fine. 
MICHAEL: No. God. You go talk to him. 
MICHAEL: No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok.  
MICHAEL: No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works. 
MICHAEL: No. Humans with AIDS. 
MICHAEL: No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance. 
MICHAEL: No. I cannot promise you that. 
MICHAEL: No. I don't want to do any of that. 
MICHAEL: No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic... 
MICHAEL: No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs. 
MICHAEL: No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance. 
MICHAEL: No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare. 
MICHAEL: No. I said I hate the, the style. 
MICHAEL: No. I think I will pass. 
MICHAEL: No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody. 
MICHAEL: No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist. 
MICHAEL: No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. 
MICHAEL: No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.? 
MICHAEL: No. I'm not going to... Bob 
MICHAEL: No. I'm sure. 
MICHAEL: No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight. 
MICHAEL: No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and... 
MICHAEL: No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you. 
MICHAEL: No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig? 
MICHAEL: No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon. 
MICHAEL: No. Just ... 
MICHAEL: No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in. 
MICHAEL: No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go. 
MICHAEL: No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people "faggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude. 
MICHAEL: No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking. 
MICHAEL: No. No! Are you sure? 
MICHAEL: No. No, I meant about being single today. 
MICHAEL: No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent. 
MICHAEL: No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh... 
MICHAEL: No. No, no, no. That crosses the line. Todd 
MICHAEL: No. No, no. There was wind. 
MICHAEL: No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win. 
MICHAEL: No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score. 
MICHAEL: No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon. 
MICHAEL: No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew. 
MICHAEL: No. No. 
MICHAEL: No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE! 
MICHAEL: No. No. He's my nephew. 
MICHAEL: No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together. 
MICHAEL: No. No. No. 
MICHAEL: No. No. No. 
MICHAEL: No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song. 
MICHAEL: No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever.  
MICHAEL: No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke. 
MICHAEL: No. No. No. Somebody in this office. 
MICHAEL: No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes.     I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy. 
MICHAEL: No. No. That's not how it works. 
MICHAEL: No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no- 
MICHAEL: No. Not a giant net. 
MICHAEL: No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me. 
MICHAEL: No. Not me, him. 
MICHAEL: No. Now, remember that honesty... 
MICHAEL: No. Oh, all right. 
MICHAEL: No. Oh. Uh... 
MICHAEL: No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls." 
MICHAEL: No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers. 
MICHAEL: No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose. 
MICHAEL: No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month. 
MICHAEL: No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be? 
MICHAEL: No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend.  Oh, hi friend! Blegh. 
MICHAEL: No. She's an alternate. 
MICHAEL: No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them. 
MICHAEL: No. The monkey! 
MICHAEL: No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best.  Take care of that, all right? 
MICHAEL: No. There's a lot I haven't done. 
MICHAEL: No. There's no one else. 
MICHAEL: No. These s'mores are disgusting. 
MICHAEL: No. This is delightful, charming culture. 
MICHAEL: No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan. 
MICHAEL: No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it. 
MICHAEL: No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some... Vance Refrigeration 
MICHAEL: No. We are not done here. This- 
MICHAEL: No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King. 
MICHAEL: No. We just talked. He's very nice. 
MICHAEL: No. What do you mean? 
MICHAEL: No. What is his name? 
MICHAEL: No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah. 
MICHAEL: No. Yes. 
MICHAEL: No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more sex.   What are you writing, perv-ball? 
MICHAEL: No. You have to just push it out! 
MICHAEL: No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother. 
MICHAEL: No... 
MICHAEL: No... 
MICHAEL: No... 
MICHAEL: No...  
MICHAEL: No... cleaning... up. 
MICHAEL: No... God. 
MICHAEL: No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK.  You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan?  
MICHAEL: No... no, this is just a stupid formality. 
MICHAEL: No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed? 
MICHAEL: No... No... 
MICHAEL: No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault. 
MICHAEL: No... She's in a coma. 
MICHAEL: No... that's... 
MICHAEL: No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie. 
MICHAEL: No... way. 
MICHAEL: No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him.  
MICHAEL: No... you're crazy. 
MICHAEL: No? 
MICHAEL: No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already? 
MICHAEL: No? No! Jim! Come on! 
MICHAEL: No? Um... Check your spam folder. 
MICHAEL: Nobody better try to stop me. Good.  
MICHAEL: Nobody cares what you think. 
MICHAEL: Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet. 
MICHAEL: Nobody likes beets. 
MICHAEL: Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited. 
MICHAEL: Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight? 
MICHAEL: Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right? 
MICHAEL: Nobody should have to go to work thinking, "Oh, this is the place that I might die today." That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying. An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true. 
MICHAEL: Nobody thanked me. 
MICHAEL: Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by. 
MICHAEL: Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day. You guys accomplished something big. You lost a ton of weight, literally. A lot of weight. And I don't care what any stupid scale says. You guys are all gigantic losers. 
MICHAEL: Noon. 
MICHAEL: NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO! 
MICHAEL: Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks. 
MICHAEL: Nope, can't make it. 
MICHAEL: Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke. 
MICHAEL: Nope, no. Guests only. 
MICHAEL: Nope, nope, nope. 
MICHAEL: Nope, that's Tuesday. 
MICHAEL: Nope, you cannot use it. 
MICHAEL: Nope. 
MICHAEL: Nope. 
MICHAEL: Nope. 
MICHAEL: Nope. 
MICHAEL: Nope. Nope. Not yet. 
MICHAEL: Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party. Officer 
MICHAEL: Nope. The opposite of that. 
MICHAEL: Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face. 
MICHAEL: Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one. 
MICHAEL: Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart.  
MICHAEL: Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo. 
MICHAEL: Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made. 
MICHAEL: Not a native speaker. 
MICHAEL: Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend. 
MICHAEL: Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it. 
MICHAEL: Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp. 
MICHAEL: Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide. 
MICHAEL: Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to. 
MICHAEL: Not classy at all. 
MICHAEL: Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back. 
MICHAEL: Not gonna happen. 
MICHAEL: Not great. 
MICHAEL: Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar. 
MICHAEL: Not if we turn these dials   all the way down.   Now they can't hear us at all. 
MICHAEL: Not important. 
MICHAEL: Not important.   Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen. 
MICHAEL: Not in the same bed. In the other bed. 
MICHAEL: Not it. I don't have eggs. 
MICHAEL: Not it's not, there's some in the straw.  There, now you may throw it out. 
MICHAEL: Not last - no. In like the last ten years. 
MICHAEL: Not much, what's up with you? 
MICHAEL: Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father. 
MICHAEL: Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday. 
MICHAEL: Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time. 
MICHAEL: Not now, not ever. 
MICHAEL: Not now. 
MICHAEL: Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David. 
MICHAEL: Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will. 
MICHAEL: Not so much. 
MICHAEL: Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would. 
MICHAEL: Not what I was looking for, but a good thought. Captain 
MICHAEL: Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town.  
MICHAEL: Not yet! 
MICHAEL: Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin. 
MICHAEL: Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon... 
MICHAEL: Not. Good. Enough! 
MICHAEL: Not. I said, not that. 
MICHAEL: Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing. 
MICHAEL: Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess. 
MICHAEL: Nothing he's doing is cheering me up. 
MICHAEL: Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman. 
MICHAEL: Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway. 
MICHAEL: Nothing. 
MICHAEL: Nothing. Cocoa. 
MICHAEL: Nothing. I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital". 
MICHAEL: Nothing. Improv 
MICHAEL: Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so... 
MICHAEL: Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say... 
MICHAEL: Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party. 
MICHAEL: Now hit me.  One, two, three. 
MICHAEL: Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight. 
MICHAEL: Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster. 
MICHAEL: Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day. 
MICHAEL: Now is really not the time, Meredith. 
MICHAEL: Now that's going on? 
MICHAEL: Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe. 
MICHAEL: Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens. 
MICHAEL: Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme... 
MICHAEL: Now you got it. 
MICHAEL: Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso? 
MICHAEL: Now you ruined it.  Bob 
MICHAEL: Now you sound like Kermit. 
MICHAEL: Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians.  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... ' 
MICHAEL: Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone? 
MICHAEL: Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood. 
MICHAEL: Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?  Ha, ha, ha. 
MICHAEL: Nowhere. 
MICHAEL: Nuhh... Girl in 
MICHAEL: Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control. 
MICHAEL: Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra. 
MICHAEL: Nurse. 
MICHAEL: Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! 
MICHAEL: Obviously. 
MICHAEL: Of course not. 
MICHAEL: Of course. 
MICHAEL: Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup. 
MICHAEL: Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time. 
MICHAEL: Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts. 
MICHAEL: Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige. That was great. That was great. That was--- that was a--- Dacvid 
MICHAEL: Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier. 
MICHAEL: Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying? 
MICHAEL: Oh coffee, that's too much.   
MICHAEL: Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday. 
MICHAEL: Oh do not raise your voice to me! 
MICHAEL: Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck. 
MICHAEL: Oh don't. That's disgusting. 
MICHAEL: Oh God- 
MICHAEL: OH GOD! 
MICHAEL: Oh God! 
MICHAEL: Oh God! 
MICHAEL: Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus? 
MICHAEL: Oh God, Rabies? 
MICHAEL: Oh God, what was that? 
MICHAEL: Oh god. 
MICHAEL: Oh God. 
MICHAEL: Oh God. Get a room Santas! 
MICHAEL: Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory. 
MICHAEL: Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on! 
MICHAEL: OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER! 
MICHAEL: Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7? 
MICHAEL: Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene? 
MICHAEL: Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good. 
MICHAEL: Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour. 
MICHAEL: Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on. 
MICHAEL: Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth? 
MICHAEL: Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones. 
MICHAEL: Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?

MICHAEL: Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint? 
MICHAEL: Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec.  Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is? 
MICHAEL: Oh ho ho! What? 
MICHAEL: Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning? 
MICHAEL: Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up. 
MICHAEL: Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face! 
MICHAEL: Oh -hoh! All right.

MICHAEL: Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Come on. Come here. Okay, okay,  stand up.  OK, here we go.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one. 
MICHAEL: Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God! 
MICHAEL: Oh my God! 
MICHAEL: Oh my God!  
MICHAEL: Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ... 
MICHAEL: Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup! 
MICHAEL: Oh my God! That's it! That's it! 
MICHAEL: Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God! What if I did? 
MICHAEL: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.   
MICHAEL: Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God, oh my God. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God, something's happening.

MICHAEL: Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well? 
MICHAEL: Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine. 
MICHAEL: Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct? 
MICHAEL: Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much! 
MICHAEL: Oh no, I have a thing tonight. 
MICHAEL: Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet. 
MICHAEL: Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady.   Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical. 
MICHAEL: Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!  Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly. 
MICHAEL: Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing? 
MICHAEL: Oh no? 
MICHAEL: Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat. 
MICHAEL: Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour. 
MICHAEL: Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries. 
MICHAEL: Oh ok. For how long? 
MICHAEL: Oh okay. I don't know how those got on there... 
MICHAEL: Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by. 
MICHAEL: Oh please. 
MICHAEL: Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam. 
MICHAEL: Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe? 
MICHAEL: Oh really. 
MICHAEL: Oh really? 
MICHAEL: Oh really? 
MICHAEL: Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me? 
MICHAEL: Oh really? Was anyone killed? 
MICHAEL: Oh really? What's her name? Burger King? 
MICHAEL: Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  What's this about? 
MICHAEL: Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check. 
MICHAEL: Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad.  
MICHAEL: Oh- She's not here? 
MICHAEL: Oh shhhh--oot! 
MICHAEL: Oh shoot!   
MICHAEL: Oh shoot. 
MICHAEL: Oh thank God. 
MICHAEL: Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Oh that I plagiarized I think. 
MICHAEL: Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too? 
MICHAEL: Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck. 
MICHAEL: Oh the Anti-Christ! 
MICHAEL: Oh this is a good one. 
MICHAEL: Oh very funny. 
MICHAEL: Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely . Prince 
MICHAEL: Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said... 
MICHAEL: Oh wow another living room! 
MICHAEL: Oh yay! Geography joke.   Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale. 
MICHAEL: Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever. 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah! 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah!  Yes he is! 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.  Oh, hey! This is Oscar--- 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot. 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass. 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo. 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you.  I love ya Pam... okay.  I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight? 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah. 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what... 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter? 
MICHAEL: Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts... 
MICHAEL: Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen,  don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards. 
MICHAEL: Oh you don't, that's- 
MICHAEL: Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up. 
MICHAEL: Oh! 
MICHAEL: Oh! 
MICHAEL: Oh! 
MICHAEL: Oh! 
MICHAEL: Oh! 
MICHAEL: Oh!   Dun-der. Dun-der... 
MICHAEL: Oh!  Wow. Awesome.  For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life. 
MICHAEL: Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or-- Pam's 
MICHAEL: Oh! God. Dwight, come on... 
MICHAEL: Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager? 
MICHAEL: Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second... 
MICHAEL: Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly. 
MICHAEL: Oh! Hey. What is this about? 
MICHAEL: Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well. 
MICHAEL: Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share? 
MICHAEL: Oh! Oh! Oh! 
MICHAEL: OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl! 
MICHAEL: Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate. 
MICHAEL: Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet! Kelly's 
MICHAEL: Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh. Edward R. 
MICHAEL: Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35. 
MICHAEL: Oh! Um, actually, I need the car. 
MICHAEL: Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi. Try my...  
MICHAEL: Oh! Well... 
MICHAEL: Oh! What's our receptionists name? 
MICHAEL: Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it! Todd 
MICHAEL: Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it. 
MICHAEL: Oh! You got it? What is that?  
MICHAEL: Oh,  lazy. Uh huh. 
MICHAEL: Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, after you. Male church 
MICHAEL: Oh, agreed, mmm, except...

MICHAEL: Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna... 
MICHAEL: Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her,  "Brbrbrbrbr!" also? 
MICHAEL: Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good? 
MICHAEL: Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah!  Oh, I love toy... 
MICHAEL: Oh, big time. 
MICHAEL: Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him. Todd 
MICHAEL: Oh, boy. Robert 
MICHAEL: Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it? 
MICHAEL: Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid? 
MICHAEL: Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please? 
MICHAEL: Oh, can you imagine? 
MICHAEL: Oh, come on. 
MICHAEL: Oh, come on. Come on. 
MICHAEL: Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul. 
MICHAEL: Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again. 
MICHAEL: Oh, did not! 
MICHAEL: Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why don't "we" take a vote on it? 
MICHAEL: Oh, does he? 
MICHAEL: Oh, don't start, 
MICHAEL: Oh, god! 
MICHAEL: Oh, God!  Oh. Wow. 
MICHAEL: Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet. 
MICHAEL: Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No! 
MICHAEL: Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem? 
MICHAEL: Oh, god, Darryl! 
MICHAEL: Oh, God, I hope it's urine. 
MICHAEL: Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat. 
MICHAEL: Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday. 
MICHAEL: Oh, God. 
MICHAEL: Oh, God.   Blood Drive 
MICHAEL: Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here. 
MICHAEL: Oh, God. Oh... 
MICHAEL: Oh, good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, good. My hooker's here.   Hi. 
MICHAEL: Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party. 
MICHAEL: Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life. 
MICHAEL: Oh, great, put her through. 
MICHAEL: Oh, great. 
MICHAEL: Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much. 
MICHAEL: Oh, have you not? 
MICHAEL: Oh, here we go! Todd 
MICHAEL: Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi. 
MICHAEL: Oh, here we go. 
MICHAEL: Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey guys. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey guys.  
MICHAEL: Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay? 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey no biggie. Just... David 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey what is this? 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey, do you still work here? 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here? 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up? 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey. Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hi. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one. 
MICHAEL: Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children!  
MICHAEL: Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her. 
MICHAEL: Oh, Hooters to go. Nice. 
MICHAEL: Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there? 
MICHAEL: Oh, I bet. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one? 
MICHAEL: Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I hate monkeys. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you! 
MICHAEL: Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here? Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy? 
MICHAEL: Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I still have more. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go? 
MICHAEL: Oh, I'll be fine. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please? Wendy's phone 
MICHAEL: Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes? 
MICHAEL: Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on! 
MICHAEL: Oh, it smells good in here. 
MICHAEL: Oh, it's okay, I'm going down. 
MICHAEL: Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend. 
MICHAEL: Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door. 
MICHAEL: Oh, just went to the bathroom. 
MICHAEL: Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up. 
MICHAEL: Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: Oh, look at that.  Smooth roll. 
MICHAEL: Oh, look at that. Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year. You doin OK, bud? 
MICHAEL: Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against violence in the workplace. 
MICHAEL: Oh, man. 
MICHAEL: Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways. 
MICHAEL: Oh, man. How much time do you have? 
MICHAEL: Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody. 
MICHAEL: Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, Michael! This'll be just us. 
MICHAEL: Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my god! 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin? 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water? 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God, what happened? 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching? 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my god. This is it. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so... 
MICHAEL: Oh, nerd alert! 
MICHAEL: Oh, new record! 
MICHAEL: Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which... 
MICHAEL: Oh, no problem.  And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no you di-int. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy! What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot?  I will destroy everything in my path- 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, my God. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no, no. You're good. It was clerical. You're good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no, no... 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no. No. Don't- 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake. Todd 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, that's a male model. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no. No. No. This is no good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco!   Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to "Y". 
MICHAEL: Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on? 
MICHAEL: Oh, now you feel some compassion for him. 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...? 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car... 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up. 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts. 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  Come in.  
MICHAEL: Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant! 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God. 
MICHAEL: Oh, OK! OK! 
MICHAEL: Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive. 
MICHAEL: Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God... 
MICHAEL: Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it? 
MICHAEL: Oh, ok. Alright. 
MICHAEL: Oh, OK. Blood 
MICHAEL: Oh, OK. Girl in 
MICHAEL: Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff?   
MICHAEL: Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me. 
MICHAEL: Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?  OK.  He's back!  OK. Hmm.  Waagh!  
MICHAEL: Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago. 
MICHAEL: Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus. 
MICHAEL: Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game? 
MICHAEL: Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me? 
MICHAEL: Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser... 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay.  
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. Gah. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual.  Sorry. Kevin.  Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy. 
MICHAEL: Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client. 
MICHAEL: Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam. 
MICHAEL: Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once? 
MICHAEL: Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only. 
MICHAEL: Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room. 
MICHAEL: Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh...  
MICHAEL: Oh, queer...  eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it. 
MICHAEL: Oh, really? 
MICHAEL: Oh, really? 
MICHAEL: Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert. 
MICHAEL: Oh, really? Ok. 
MICHAEL: Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much. 
MICHAEL: Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought. 
MICHAEL: Oh, right, I'm sorry. What 
MICHAEL: Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic? 
MICHAEL: Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party? 
MICHAEL: Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, she is hot.   
MICHAEL: Oh, she's great. 
MICHAEL: Oh, shiii... 
MICHAEL: Oh, shoot. Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess. 
MICHAEL: Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place. 
MICHAEL: Oh, so that's what they are saying? 
MICHAEL: Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing. 
MICHAEL: Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had. 
MICHAEL: Oh, stop it Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.  
MICHAEL: Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going?  Heh-woh you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you my dear. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two-- 
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think.  
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thanks.  
MICHAEL: Oh, thanks.  You're not bad, either. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that hurts. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that is gross. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that looks good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that sounds awful. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that's a good idea. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that's not appropriate. Todd 
MICHAEL: Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK... Coffee shop 
MICHAEL: Oh, that's okay, she can keep those. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic. 
MICHAEL: Oh, the Wall. 
MICHAEL: Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party? 
MICHAEL: Oh, there we go. 
MICHAEL: Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows? 
MICHAEL: Oh, these... all your kids? 
MICHAEL: Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore! 
MICHAEL: Oh, time and resources. 
MICHAEL: Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now. 
MICHAEL: Oh, um, potato salad. 
MICHAEL: Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please? 
MICHAEL: Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there. 
MICHAEL: Oh, umm...  Sadiq (IT 
MICHAEL: Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in. 
MICHAEL: Oh, was he? Well who, his sister? 
MICHAEL: Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision. Prince 
MICHAEL: Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay... 
MICHAEL: Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way.  
MICHAEL: Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn. 
MICHAEL: Oh, well, that's fine. Blood 
MICHAEL: Oh, well, then, email it to me. 
MICHAEL: Oh, well. 
MICHAEL: Oh, well. 
MICHAEL: Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up. 
MICHAEL: Oh, well... Kiss.  That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight  
MICHAEL: Oh, what are you usually? 
MICHAEL: Oh, what did you do today? 
MICHAEL: Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose. 
MICHAEL: Oh, what's that out there? 
MICHAEL: Oh, why do I feel like crap? 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow look at those. How nice for you. Up there, front and center, beautiful. I think they would look better right here.   They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.   
MICHAEL: Oh, wow! 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker. 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button. 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow! What did you do? 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow! Whoa! 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God!  
MICHAEL: Oh, wow, so quickly. 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again.  "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you". 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow. 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow. 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually.  There you go. Use it in good health. Tom and 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah right. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women? 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it real good? 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah, that sounds good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah.  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?  
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers?  Michael Scott, head of sales. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah. Todd 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah... 
MICHAEL: Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of- 
MICHAEL: Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yes.  Doobie-doobie doo. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you are such mench my friend.  
MICHAEL: Oh, you do? 
MICHAEL: Oh, you got to be kidding me.  Look at that. That's - 
MICHAEL: Oh, you gotta be... Josh? 
MICHAEL: Oh, you idiot. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor.  But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right?  You want to try? 
MICHAEL: Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you know what? You know what? I shouldn't go in there. I'm pretty busy, I should just... 
MICHAEL: Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that? 
MICHAEL: Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So... 
MICHAEL: Oh, you move on. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes... 
MICHAEL: Oh, you wanna go today? 
MICHAEL: Oh, your face! Oh! 
MICHAEL: Oh, you're sorry? 
MICHAEL: Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital! 
MICHAEL: Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yuck.  
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh.   Bastard! 
MICHAEL: Oh.  Come on. Be serious. 
MICHAEL: Oh.  That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: Oh.  What the hell is that? 
MICHAEL: Oh.  Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer! 
MICHAEL: Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Alright. There you go. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Bad boy.  Um... Ryan?  Todd 
MICHAEL: Oh. Ben 
MICHAEL: Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that. 
MICHAEL: Oh. He did? What did he say? 
MICHAEL: Oh. Hello! Ben 
MICHAEL: Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life. 
MICHAEL: Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime. 
MICHAEL: Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Koselli. With the Jello. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Oh, no.  It's Jan. What do I do? 
MICHAEL: Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there.  
MICHAEL: Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh? 
MICHAEL: Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on? 
MICHAEL: Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Please. Colin Powell. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Thank God. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly. 
MICHAEL: Oh. That's nice. 
MICHAEL: Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away.  
MICHAEL: Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn. 
MICHAEL: Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital? 
MICHAEL: Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Wow. "Michael Scott Paper Company." Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence." 
MICHAEL: Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you! 
MICHAEL: Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing. 
MICHAEL: Oh. You waiting for a call? 
MICHAEL: Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette. 
MICHAEL: Oh... 
MICHAEL: Oh... 
MICHAEL: Oh... 
MICHAEL: Oh... 
MICHAEL: Oh... 
MICHAEL: Oh... 
MICHAEL: Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up. 
MICHAEL: Oh... ah, I almost choked. 
MICHAEL: Oh... God...  God!  We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here . 
MICHAEL: Oh... It's ... 
MICHAEL: Oh... kay. 
MICHAEL: Oh... kay... 
MICHAEL: Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart. 
MICHAEL: Oh... ok. 
MICHAEL: Oh... okay.   Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap. I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold. I will don it... and oh! Look at that. I can't see because I am in a--   GAH! 
MICHAEL: Oh... okay. Were you saving it? Pam's 
MICHAEL: Oh... Sadiq (IT 
MICHAEL: Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there. 
MICHAEL: Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in? 
MICHAEL: Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are. 
MICHAEL: Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is? 
MICHAEL: Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma. Officer 
MICHAEL: Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him. 
MICHAEL: Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year. 
MICHAEL: Ohh, God! 
MICHAEL: Ohh, god. 
MICHAEL: Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear... 
MICHAEL: Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College. 
MICHAEL: Ohh, lunch party. 
MICHAEL: Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this. 
MICHAEL: Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm.. 
MICHAEL: Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I--- 
MICHAEL: Ohh. May I? 
MICHAEL: Ohh.. 
MICHAEL: Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything? 
MICHAEL: Ohh... kay. 
MICHAEL: Ohh... OK. 
MICHAEL: Ohhh happy birthday Jim! 
MICHAEL: Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review- 
MICHAEL: Ohhh, no. 
MICHAEL: Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out. 
MICHAEL: Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute. 
MICHAEL: Ohhhh. Arrrgggh! 
MICHAEL: Ohhhhh... 
MICHAEL: Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I... 
MICHAEL: Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man? 
MICHAEL: Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars. 
MICHAEL: Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why. Todd 
MICHAEL: OK 
MICHAEL: Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.   You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short... 
MICHAEL: OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies.  That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. 
MICHAEL: OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays. 
MICHAEL: Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation. 
MICHAEL: Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you. 
MICHAEL: Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything. 
MICHAEL: Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first. 
MICHAEL: OK! 
MICHAEL: Ok,  what does this look like to you Stanley?! 
MICHAEL: OK, 1 Sikh, and... 
MICHAEL: OK, a little too far, crossed the line. 
MICHAEL: Ok, alright I gotta go. 
MICHAEL: Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back. 
MICHAEL: Ok, alright, where is Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Ok, alright. 
MICHAEL: Ok, alright. 
MICHAEL: Ok, be more specific. 
MICHAEL: OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work. 
MICHAEL: OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop. 
MICHAEL: Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan? 
MICHAEL: Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise. 
MICHAEL: OK, don't get that. Please?   
MICHAEL: Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls. 
MICHAEL: Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty? 
MICHAEL: Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry. 
MICHAEL: OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus. 
MICHAEL: Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you. 
MICHAEL: OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK. 
MICHAEL: OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts. 
MICHAEL: OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit? 
MICHAEL: Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers! 
MICHAEL: Ok, feel better. 
MICHAEL: OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load. 
MICHAEL: OK, forget it. 
MICHAEL: Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch. 
MICHAEL: Ok, good. 
MICHAEL: OK, good. 
MICHAEL: OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic. 
MICHAEL: Ok, goodbye Prince Family. 
MICHAEL: Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave; goodbye. 
MICHAEL: OK, here are your character cards. Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props. Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is. Everything else is up to your imagination. So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse. 
MICHAEL: Ok, here we go. Alright, come on. 
MICHAEL: OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that? 
MICHAEL: OK, Hey, man, how's it going? 
MICHAEL: Ok, I am going to count down from five. 
MICHAEL: OK, I am really going to do this. 
MICHAEL: Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody. 
MICHAEL: Ok, I have an announcement. 
MICHAEL: OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant. 
MICHAEL: OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife. 
MICHAEL: OK, I will play guy listening. Mr. 
MICHAEL: OK, I'll take it.  OK. 
MICHAEL: Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just. 
MICHAEL: OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet? 
MICHAEL: OK, it stopped. 
MICHAEL: Ok, it's done. Actually,  Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done. 
MICHAEL: OK, just remember to keep breathing. 
MICHAEL: Ok, let me ask you this. 
MICHAEL: OK, let me be. 
MICHAEL: Ok, let's do this thing.  Wish us luck. 
MICHAEL: Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax!   
MICHAEL: OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder.  Let's go! 
MICHAEL: Ok, let's take 15, again. 
MICHAEL: Ok, let's try another one. Um... 
MICHAEL: Ok, Michael, what are you doing? 
MICHAEL: Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her. 
MICHAEL: OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie. 
MICHAEL: OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week. 
MICHAEL: Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace.   I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it.   
MICHAEL: Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation... 
MICHAEL: OK, OK! So you'll reconsider? 
MICHAEL: OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works. 
MICHAEL: Ok, ok, ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen.   He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work. 
MICHAEL: OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye.  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free. 
MICHAEL: Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project. 
MICHAEL: Ok, ok... 
MICHAEL: Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points. 
MICHAEL: OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice. 
MICHAEL: OK, ready? 
MICHAEL: OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy. 
MICHAEL: OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell? 
MICHAEL: Ok, see what I did? 
MICHAEL: Ok, see you later. Nice job, Bill. Not. 
MICHAEL: OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway? 
MICHAEL: Ok, so we're on the same page, great. 
MICHAEL: Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place? 
MICHAEL: OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course. 
MICHAEL: Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok? 
MICHAEL: OK, that's not helpful Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street!  Come on everybody!  
MICHAEL: Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that? 
MICHAEL: OK, use your imaginations. 
MICHAEL: OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at...  Packer@DunderMifflin.com. Packaging@DunderMifflin.com. Uh oh. 
MICHAEL: OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.   Yes. 
MICHAEL: OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins. 
MICHAEL: OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25. 
MICHAEL: OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant. 
MICHAEL: Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy.  This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to.  She probably won't be up for a few hours. 
MICHAEL: OK, well I know. You told me that several times. Mr. 
MICHAEL: OK, well payroll is in charge of all that. 
MICHAEL: Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try.  Wendy's phone 
MICHAEL: OK, what else? 
MICHAEL: Ok, what kinda machine is that? 
MICHAEL: OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend.  
MICHAEL: OK, who's hungry  No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest.  For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set. 
MICHAEL: Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please.  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind--- Michael and 
MICHAEL: OK, yeah. 
MICHAEL: OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh... 
MICHAEL: Ok, yes. Sure. 
MICHAEL: OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that. 
MICHAEL: Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about. 
MICHAEL: OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just... 
MICHAEL: Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell. 
MICHAEL: Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  Sorry, he is very lame.  Um, let's see. "Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter." 
MICHAEL: Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard. 
MICHAEL: OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch. 
MICHAEL: Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off! 
MICHAEL: OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up. 
MICHAEL: Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not? 
MICHAEL: OK, yup. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: OK.  
MICHAEL: Ok.   
MICHAEL: Ok.  Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs. 
MICHAEL: Ok.  Ok, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here. 
MICHAEL: OK.  Phyllis, you say?  Hmm.  
MICHAEL: Ok.  That's not appropriate.  Uncool. Uncool, Dwight.  Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go.  
MICHAEL: Ok.  Why did you have to be so damn good? 
MICHAEL: Ok. All right. Bob 
MICHAEL: OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK. 
MICHAEL: OK. All right. See you later. 
MICHAEL: OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Alright. Oh boy. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track.  45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business.  And you can take that to the bank.  And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.  I love you, New York!  You. You. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Billy 
MICHAEL: Ok. Billy 
MICHAEL: Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through... 
MICHAEL: OK. Cool, you're on.  Don't screw this up. 
MICHAEL: OK. Did everybody get one of these? 
MICHAEL: Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it? 
MICHAEL: Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come. 
MICHAEL: OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here? 
MICHAEL: Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do. 
MICHAEL: Ok. I love it. I love it. 
MICHAEL: Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick.  And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it? 
MICHAEL: OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me...  Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  I take care of my kid! Mr. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Improv 
MICHAEL: OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I... 
MICHAEL: OK. Mr. 
MICHAEL: OK. Mr. 
MICHAEL: OK. No problem. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave. 
MICHAEL: OK. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers. This is hers, she left her glove. I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove. Blood Drive 
MICHAEL: Ok. Okay. Good night.  Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.' 
MICHAEL: Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything.   
MICHAEL: Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on? 
MICHAEL: OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim? 
MICHAEL: Ok. See you soon. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie. 
MICHAEL: Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah?  Meredith? 
MICHAEL: Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again. 
MICHAEL: OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts.  Hey, what... 
MICHAEL: OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it. 
MICHAEL: OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it? 
MICHAEL: Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit - 
MICHAEL: OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people? 
MICHAEL: OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy. 
MICHAEL: OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr... Mr. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Yeah, what, what? 
MICHAEL: Ok. You just, uh, clear your head. 
MICHAEL: Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine. 
MICHAEL: OK... 
MICHAEL: OK... 
MICHAEL: Ok... alright... here we go.  There.  Oooookay. 
MICHAEL: Ok... Billy 
MICHAEL: Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay?   Let's give this a shot. 
MICHAEL: Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this? 
MICHAEL: OK... Meredith,  Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear. 
MICHAEL: OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks. 
MICHAEL: Ok? 
MICHAEL: OK? 
MICHAEL: OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right? 
MICHAEL: Oka-- 
MICHAEL: Okay 
MICHAEL: Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement? 
MICHAEL: Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh!  
MICHAEL: Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself. 
MICHAEL: Okay geniuses, how would you do it? 
MICHAEL: Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God! 
MICHAEL: Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1,2,3- What are we gonna do? 
MICHAEL: Okay Pam, I have another little project for you. 
MICHAEL: Okay shut up. 
MICHAEL: Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences. 
MICHAEL: Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again. 
MICHAEL: Okay! 
MICHAEL: Okay! 
MICHAEL: Okay!  Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: Okay! Alright, okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay! Calm down. 
MICHAEL: Okay! Excellent. Oh... 
MICHAEL: Okay! I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go! 
MICHAEL: Okay! Okay! 
MICHAEL: Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line.  
MICHAEL: Okay! So... Captain 
MICHAEL: Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office. 
MICHAEL: Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful. 
MICHAEL: Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her. 
MICHAEL: Okay, all right, whatever. 
MICHAEL: Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: Okay, alright. 
MICHAEL: Okay, alright.  Hospital 
MICHAEL: Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage. Hank  :   Me and the blues. It's me and the blues.   
MICHAEL: Okay, are you cool, really? 
MICHAEL: Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection. 
MICHAEL: Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you... 
MICHAEL: Okay, bye bye. 
MICHAEL: Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye. 
MICHAEL: Okay, calm down. I have a small problem. 
MICHAEL: Okay, can I have that? 
MICHAEL: Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix. 
MICHAEL: Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it.  Not bad, huh? 
MICHAEL: Okay, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Dwight. Here we go  oh god. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today. 
MICHAEL: Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam. 
MICHAEL: Okay, enough small talk, go ahead. 
MICHAEL: Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with? 
MICHAEL: Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place. 
MICHAEL: Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go. 
MICHAEL: Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control - 
MICHAEL: Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him. 
MICHAEL: Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America. 
MICHAEL: Okay, fine. Hurry back. 
MICHAEL: Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit. 
MICHAEL: Okay, go back to the annex. 
MICHAEL: Okay, go, go, go, go! 
MICHAEL: Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright? 
MICHAEL: Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one?  
MICHAEL: Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time. 
MICHAEL: Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator. 
MICHAEL: Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam.  And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four. 
MICHAEL: Okay, here we go. Andy & 
MICHAEL: Okay, here we go. Blood Drive 
MICHAEL: Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?! 
MICHAEL: Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case. 
MICHAEL: Okay, here's what we're going to 
MICHAEL: Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me. 
MICHAEL: Okay, hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class. Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience. And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.  Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you. 
MICHAEL: Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together? 
MICHAEL: Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.  
MICHAEL: Okay, how do you feel? 
MICHAEL: Okay, I believe you, I believe you. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I got it. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I have a good thing with the mom- 
MICHAEL: Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks... 
MICHAEL: Okay, I have more of them. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I will start. Um, "A."  "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell? Um... 
MICHAEL: Okay, I will think about it. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but... 
MICHAEL: Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys? 
MICHAEL: Okay, I'm calling the police. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own? 
MICHAEL: Okay, I'm out of here,  see you later guys... 
MICHAEL: Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies. 
MICHAEL: Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files. 
MICHAEL: Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon. Pizza 
MICHAEL: Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else? 
MICHAEL: Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised. 
MICHAEL: Okay, just summarize. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai. 
MICHAEL: Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for. 
MICHAEL: Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us. 
MICHAEL: Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months? 
MICHAEL: Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything. 
MICHAEL: Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been... Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it. 
MICHAEL: Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere. 
MICHAEL: Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N. 
MICHAEL: Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything? 
MICHAEL: Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit  Complicit. You were all successories! 
MICHAEL: Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle. 
MICHAEL: Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar? 
MICHAEL: Okay, oh okay, okay. Close your eyes. 
MICHAEL: Okay, oh! All right. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions... 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay, okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Okay, we don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me people. Stop. Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me. Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height. Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future. Hello, I am your future. You're older, and you are very happy now. Because you went with Michael Scott. Right. So everybody come on down. Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright? Come on! Are you, are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be?   Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot. Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on Phyllis. Here we go, here we go! 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza? 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. I'll show them. Here we go.   Stanley. All right. CPR 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens? 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. Um... 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person. 
MICHAEL: Okay, orange slices. There ya go. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee. 
MICHAEL: Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume? 
MICHAEL: Okay, put it on my card. 
MICHAEL: Okay, right there is the problem. There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk. 
MICHAEL: Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Okay, security guard. 
MICHAEL: Okay, see you guys.  Hey, how you doin'? 
MICHAEL: Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec. 
MICHAEL: Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  Who else? Come on! People, I know models! 
MICHAEL: Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them?  You call it. 
MICHAEL: Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us? 
MICHAEL: Okay, so dig 
MICHAEL: Okay, so Dwight, in your own words -  "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert."  "Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to." 
MICHAEL: Okay, so killing yourself.  I was just thinking about snot. 
MICHAEL: Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni? 
MICHAEL: Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida? 
MICHAEL: Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first. 
MICHAEL: Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door. 
MICHAEL: Okay, some for, some against. 
MICHAEL: Okay, sounds great. 
MICHAEL: Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of. 
MICHAEL: Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is. 
MICHAEL: Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines. 
MICHAEL: Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win. 
MICHAEL: Okay, that might help. If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody. 
MICHAEL: okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour? 
MICHAEL: Okay, the opposite of that? 
MICHAEL: Okay, then I want Pam back. 
MICHAEL: Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes? 
MICHAEL: Okay, this is it.  This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person." It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else. 
MICHAEL: Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now. 
MICHAEL: Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed.   It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars.   300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400-  Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450   Sold! For 300 dollars to me!   What the hell is that? 
MICHAEL: Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other. 
MICHAEL: Okay, uh, well, one is taken. 
MICHAEL: Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary. 
MICHAEL: Okay, weirdo. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well--- 
MICHAEL: Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership. Captain 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets... 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, we'll figure something.  
MICHAEL: Okay, well. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well... all settled, then. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you. 
MICHAEL: Okay, we're trapped. Everyone for himself. 
MICHAEL: Okay, what does that mean? 
MICHAEL: Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time? Pizza 
MICHAEL: Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson? I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me? 
MICHAEL: Okay, who said that? 
MICHAEL: Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey! 
MICHAEL: Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else. 
MICHAEL: Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway. 
MICHAEL: Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible. 
MICHAEL: Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up. 
MICHAEL: Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that. 
MICHAEL: Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it? 
MICHAEL: Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure. Todd 
MICHAEL: Okay, you get out of here, big dog.  Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas. 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party. 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby. 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what Toby? One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I'm doing your job man. Hey, are you texting? 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair. 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl. 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried. 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing." 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right? 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off. 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay.

MICHAEL: Okay.   
MICHAEL: Okay.   This city. Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed. David 
MICHAEL: Okay.  And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way. 
MICHAEL: Okay.  Hello.  Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny. 
MICHAEL: Okay.  No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough... 
MICHAEL: Okay.  Okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay.  Phyllis. Okay. Look at me.  Phyllis, look at--  okay, that's...  All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna. 
MICHAEL: Okay.  There! No more conflict.  I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty.  All right... is that it? 
MICHAEL: Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore? 
MICHAEL: Okay. A lame attempt at humor. Swing and a miss. Financial 
MICHAEL: Okay. All right. 
MICHAEL: Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch. 
MICHAEL: Okay. All right. Deposition 
MICHAEL: Okay. Alright, I'll do it. Yeah. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Yeah. What do I? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Alright. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit.  Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in! 
MICHAEL: Okay. Fine. No more PDA. 
MICHAEL: Okay. From the top. Ready? Three- 
MICHAEL: Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day.  And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Hayworth's 
MICHAEL: O-kay. Hello Jan. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Hello. Blood 
MICHAEL: Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua. 
MICHAEL: Okay. How about a woman? Pam? 
MICHAEL: Okay. How's yoga? 
MICHAEL: Okay. I appreciate the feedback. 
MICHAEL: Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit. 
MICHAEL: Okay. I promise.  For the record your mom came on to me.  
MICHAEL: Okay. If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople. 
MICHAEL: Okay. I'll be right back. . Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people. 
MICHAEL: Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you. 
MICHAEL: Okay. It's going to be great. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave.  Don't leave. Don't let him. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right?  
MICHAEL: Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good.   Because I am busy taking you out. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week? 
MICHAEL: O-kay. Oh... hey, hey.  What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever.  What the hell is going on back there? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go.  
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says "Creed." 
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart." 
MICHAEL: Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Pam, pros. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Rule five - safety first, i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer. 
MICHAEL: Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Spoiler... alert. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Sure. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Talk to you Monday. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Thanks for coming. 
MICHAEL: Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own. 
MICHAEL: Okay. This is going to kill Kevin. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Uh... 
MICHAEL: Okay. Um, her. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Wait, what? 
MICHAEL: Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers. 
MICHAEL: Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so... 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand- 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well. Live strong. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better. 
MICHAEL: Okay. What do you think? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Where is my translator? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and... 
MICHAEL: Okay. Yes! It was a trick question. 
MICHAEL: Okay. You can count on me. 
MICHAEL: Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days. 
MICHAEL: Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless! 
MICHAEL: Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so. 
MICHAEL: Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well. 
MICHAEL: Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car - 
MICHAEL: O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is? 
MICHAEL: Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave? 
MICHAEL: Okay. You've just lost my business. 
MICHAEL: Okay... 
MICHAEL: Okay... 
MICHAEL: Okay...  Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no! 
MICHAEL: Okay...  Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it! 
MICHAEL: Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam. 
MICHAEL: Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it! 
MICHAEL: Okay... Sherri? 
MICHAEL: Okay... that's... 
MICHAEL: Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle? 
MICHAEL: Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution. 
MICHAEL: Okay... what? 
MICHAEL: Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match! 
MICHAEL: Okey doke. Hotel 
MICHAEL: Old fashioned meet market -- 
MICHAEL: Old fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah. Follow my lead. 
MICHAEL: Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment. 
MICHAEL: On a Friday?  
MICHAEL: On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit. 
MICHAEL: On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me. Ben 
MICHAEL: On purpose? 
MICHAEL: On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns. 
MICHAEL: On the phone. 
MICHAEL: On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three. 
MICHAEL: On whom's authority? 
MICHAEL: On your left! 
MICHAEL: On. Just put it on. 
MICHAEL: Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes. 
MICHAEL: Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go! 
MICHAEL: Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office.  It was hysterical. 
MICHAEL: One for me one for Jan. 
MICHAEL: One hour. 
MICHAEL: One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today. 
MICHAEL: One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out. 
MICHAEL: One more time.  You... 
MICHAEL: One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift. 
MICHAEL: One, two, three..  
MICHAEL: One. Two. Three. 
MICHAEL: Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money. 
MICHAEL: Only one that I was kind of worried about. 
MICHAEL: Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it! 
MICHAEL: Ooh, I want to hold the baby! 
MICHAEL: Ooh, someone's freakin'. 
MICHAEL: Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date? 
MICHAEL: Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What? 
MICHAEL: OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. 
MICHAEL: Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam. 
MICHAEL: Oooh! 
MICHAEL: Oooh, okay. That was still about me. 
MICHAEL: Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that. 
MICHAEL: Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me? 
MICHAEL: Oooo. Catcher or in field? 
MICHAEL: Oooooh, my life! 
MICHAEL: Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now! 
MICHAEL: Open your mouth. 
MICHAEL: Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it. 
MICHAEL: Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish.  Just kidding. Do you like mints? 
MICHAEL: Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically. 
MICHAEL: Or a trained seal.  
MICHAEL: Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just-- 
MICHAEL: Or is it? 
MICHAEL: Or sooner. 
MICHAEL: Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner! 
MICHAEL: Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart." 
MICHAEL: Oscar! Think abou- Think!  
MICHAEL: Oscar, enough with the girl talk please. 
MICHAEL: Oscar, here you go.  
MICHAEL: Oscar, homosexual accountant. 
MICHAEL: Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall? 
MICHAEL: Oscar, what were you going to say? 
MICHAEL: Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume? 
MICHAEL: Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about. 
MICHAEL: Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome. 
MICHAEL: Oscar's a douche. 
MICHAEL: Other than me. 
MICHAEL: Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser. 
MICHAEL: Ouchy. 
MICHAEL: Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names. 
MICHAEL: Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle... 
MICHAEL: Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business. Financial 
MICHAEL: Over our love. 
MICHAEL: Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work 
MICHAEL: Ow!  You never forget. Whoo! 
MICHAEL: Ow! God! 
MICHAEL: Oy vey... schmear.  
MICHAEL: Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh? 
MICHAEL: Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall. 
MICHAEL: Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream. 
MICHAEL: Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe. 
MICHAEL: Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman.  Oh! Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay? 
MICHAEL: Pam told me.  
MICHAEL: Pam! 
MICHAEL: Pam! 
MICHAEL: Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast. 
MICHAEL: Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now. 
MICHAEL: Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call. 
MICHAEL: Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat.   Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So I think I will just...drag it out. Since the dawn of time there has been-- 
MICHAEL: Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real. 
MICHAEL: Pam, could I see you in my office? 
MICHAEL: Pam, could you come get me?! 
MICHAEL: Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem. 
MICHAEL: Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right? 
MICHAEL: Pam, everybody!    
MICHAEL: Pam, I don't make the rules.   
MICHAEL: Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly. 
MICHAEL: Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A "Michael-idea" folder? 
MICHAEL: Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day. 
MICHAEL: Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done. 
MICHAEL: Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here. 
MICHAEL: Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me. 
MICHAEL: Pam, listen. This order form. Instead of saying "Dunder Mifflin" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else? 
MICHAEL: Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you. Bass 
MICHAEL: Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet? 
MICHAEL: Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Pam, please clear my phone lines. 
MICHAEL: Pam, please? I have Country Crock. 
MICHAEL: Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back. 
MICHAEL: Pam, really, they're back? 
MICHAEL: Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background. 
MICHAEL: Pam, translate. 
MICHAEL: Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted. 
MICHAEL: Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair. 
MICHAEL: Pam, would you smell my breath? 
MICHAEL: Pam, would you stand up for a sec?   Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair.   Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?   They don't have copiers. They don't even-   Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I 
MICHAEL: Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey.  Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring...  We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan. 
MICHAEL: Pam, you're trustworthy- 
MICHAEL: Pam. 
MICHAEL: Pam. 
MICHAEL: Pam. 
MICHAEL: Pam. 
MICHAEL: Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.   Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here? 
MICHAEL: Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours. 
MICHAEL: Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w--- 
MICHAEL: P-A-M. P-A 
MICHAEL: Pam. Pam, you gave me your word. 
MICHAEL: Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away. 
MICHAEL: Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies. 
MICHAEL: Pam... PAAAM!? 
MICHAEL: Pam? 
MICHAEL: Pam? 
MICHAEL: Pam? 
MICHAEL: Pam? 
MICHAEL: Pam? Knock, knock. 
MICHAEL: Pam? Pam? 
MICHAEL: Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town. 
MICHAEL: Pamela Beesly Halpert-- 
MICHAEL: Pamela. 
MICHAEL: Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock. 
MICHAEL: Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding? 
MICHAEL: Pam's mom. 
MICHAEL: Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please. 
MICHAEL: Parkoooooour! 
MICHAEL: Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women. 
MICHAEL: Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine. 
MICHAEL: Party central! So, what can I do you for?  All right. 
MICHAEL: Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles. 
MICHAEL: Pass. 
MICHAEL: Pass. 
MICHAEL: Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers. 
MICHAEL: Pays five million dollars. Nudity required. 
MICHAEL: PB and J, my mom's recipe!  
MICHAEL: People are always coming to me. "Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust." No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause. 
MICHAEL: People have been filtering in and out. 
MICHAEL: People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable. 
MICHAEL: People say I am the best boss. They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious." "And you get the best out of us."  I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. 
MICHAEL: People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want. 
MICHAEL: People work faster after... 
MICHAEL: People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers. 
MICHAEL: People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one. 
MICHAEL: Per diem. 
MICHAEL: Per mile, yes. 
MICHAEL: Perfect crime. 
MICHAEL: Perfect. 
MICHAEL: Perfect.  Robert 
MICHAEL: Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan. 
MICHAEL: Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on. 
MICHAEL: Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift. 
MICHAEL: Pervert. 
MICHAEL: Pfffffttt. 
MICHAEL: Phyllis and 
MICHAEL: Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride. 
MICHAEL: Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter? 
MICHAEL: Phyllis, can you do this? 
MICHAEL: Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa? 
MICHAEL: Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do? 
MICHAEL: Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember. 
MICHAEL: Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done? 
MICHAEL: Phyllis? 
MICHAEL: Phyllis? 
MICHAEL: Phyllis? Could you take-. 
MICHAEL: Pictures. Memories.  Look at that. They grow up so fast. 
MICHAEL: Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity. 
MICHAEL: Pippity poppity. 
MICHAEL: Pizza by Alfredo. 
MICHAEL: Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza? 
MICHAEL: Place is packed. 
MICHAEL: Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man. 
MICHAEL: Play some games? 
MICHAEL: Please don't do that. 
MICHAEL: Please just check. 
MICHAEL: Please stop popping my cast. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Please stop. 15 lives. I destroyed 15 young lives today. 
MICHAEL: Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company? 
MICHAEL: Please, Kevin. You're fired.  Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go? 
MICHAEL: Please, not at a time like this.  
MICHAEL: Please. 
MICHAEL: Please. 
MICHAEL: Please. 
MICHAEL: Please? 
MICHAEL: Please? 
MICHAEL: Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett. 
MICHAEL: Plenty of space in the parking lot. 
MICHAEL: Plus perks, yes. 
MICHAEL: Pointless. 
MICHAEL: Pop quiz. 
MICHAEL: Post-it Notes. 
MICHAEL: Potential, lots of potential. yes. 
MICHAEL: Pow pow pow...   
MICHAEL: Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth." 
MICHAEL: Pretty good. 
MICHAEL: Pretty weird.  Tall Girl 
MICHAEL: Previously on Varsity Blues... 
MICHAEL: Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice. 
MICHAEL: Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds. 
MICHAEL: Pro. 
MICHAEL: Pro-Am. 
MICHAEL: Probably get soup or something light. 
MICHAEL: Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go. 
MICHAEL: Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo. 
MICHAEL: Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Probably the best one that we have ever had, right?  But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter. 
MICHAEL: Problem. Good. 
MICHAEL: Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me. 
MICHAEL: Pssh, kay. 
MICHAEL: PSST! PSST! 
MICHAEL: Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do. 
MICHAEL: Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him. 
MICHAEL: Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!   Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.   And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D.   Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!   
MICHAEL: Push free play til tomorrow morning.  Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made. 
MICHAEL: Push it. 
MICHAEL: Push. Good! That's great. You got it.  Excuse me. 
MICHAEL: Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man! 
MICHAEL: Put it down. 
MICHAEL: Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head? 
MICHAEL: Question. How long do we have to...  Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it? 
MICHAEL: Questions? 
MICHAEL: Quiz me up. 
MICHAEL: Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do. 
MICHAEL: Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan. 
MICHAEL: Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So... 
MICHAEL: Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want?   What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones. 
MICHAEL: Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson". It's kind of snooty. So. 
MICHAEL: Raise your cups on high. Case closed. 
MICHAEL: Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best. 
MICHAEL: Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it. Bar 
MICHAEL: Ready to do this? 
MICHAEL: Ready to play some games? Let's do it! 
MICHAEL: Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm. 
MICHAEL: Real entertainers, like Billy Joel. 
MICHAEL: Real sports with Bryant Gumble. 
MICHAEL: Really loud. 
MICHAEL: Really sad. 
MICHAEL: Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and... 
MICHAEL: Really. Ben 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
MICHAEL: Really?  
MICHAEL: Really?   Oh, thanks. 
MICHAEL: Really?  Thank you. All right. 
MICHAEL: Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up.  It's trying to stand up...  there it goes. 
MICHAEL: Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing. 
MICHAEL: Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales. 
MICHAEL: Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday. 
MICHAEL: Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office? 
MICHAEL: Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one! Todd 
MICHAEL: Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Really? I didn't...  Did we get a fax this morning? 
MICHAEL: Really? Is she OK? 
MICHAEL: Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think. 
MICHAEL: Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic. 
MICHAEL: Really? Okay. Well, word of 
MICHAEL: Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation. Prince 
MICHAEL: Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office. 
MICHAEL: Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house? 
MICHAEL: Really? That's kind of a big client.   Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account? 
MICHAEL: Really? That's weird. We didn't see any. 
MICHAEL: Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy? 
MICHAEL: Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead. 
MICHAEL: Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22. 
MICHAEL: Really? We're good? 
MICHAEL: Really? What happened? 
MICHAEL: Really? What's going on? 
MICHAEL: Really? Would you do that? 
MICHAEL: Really? Wow. That's over $200 a year. 
MICHAEL: Really? You told on me. That's lame. 
MICHAEL: Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan... 
MICHAEL: Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it!  I kissed. We kissed. 
MICHAEL: Recess. Edward R. 
MICHAEL: Regional manager. Ad guy 
MICHAEL: Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.  
MICHAEL: Remember the narc bit?  Uh-oh, who's in trouble? 
MICHAEL: Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge. 
MICHAEL: Return. 
MICHAEL: Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm. 
MICHAEL: Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers. 
MICHAEL: Right here! Right here!  Michael and 
MICHAEL: Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today. 
MICHAEL: Right here. 
MICHAEL: Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness? 
MICHAEL: Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God. 
MICHAEL: Right there.  
MICHAEL: Right there. Ah. 
MICHAEL: Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base? 
MICHAEL: Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait...  no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home. 
MICHAEL: Right there. The coach! 
MICHAEL: Right what? 
MICHAEL: Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty. Pizza 
MICHAEL: Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes. 
MICHAEL: Right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party. A big office party I need to go to, so... Can't get out of it. 
MICHAEL: Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke. 
MICHAEL: Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor. 
MICHAEL: Right. 
MICHAEL: Right. 
MICHAEL: Right. 
MICHAEL: Right. 
MICHAEL: Right. 
MICHAEL: Right. 
MICHAEL: Right.  
MICHAEL: Right. Captain 
MICHAEL: Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um... 
MICHAEL: Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis! Mr. 
MICHAEL: Right. What? 
MICHAEL: Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly. 
MICHAEL: Right... Executive assistant. 
MICHAEL: Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice. 
MICHAEL: Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands. 
MICHAEL: Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout. 
MICHAEL: Road trip! Right? 
MICHAEL: Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork." Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. 
MICHAEL: Rock and roll.  
MICHAEL: Rock it! Captain 
MICHAEL: Rock n' roll! 
MICHAEL: Rolando,   I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime. 
MICHAEL: Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him. 
MICHAEL: Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing. 
MICHAEL: Roy said the first one didn't count. 
MICHAEL: Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it? 
MICHAEL: Run what? 
MICHAEL: Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow. 
MICHAEL: Ryan come here! 
MICHAEL: Ryan Howard everybody.  Good job.  
MICHAEL: Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake. 
MICHAEL: Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance. Girl in 2nd 
MICHAEL: Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food. 
MICHAEL: Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company. 
MICHAEL: Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one. 
MICHAEL: Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative. 
MICHAEL: Saber. 
MICHAEL: Sabre is changing everything.  Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace? 
MICHAEL: Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre. 
MICHAEL: Sad, something to break. 
MICHAEL: Sad. To soak up my tears. 
MICHAEL: Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck. 
MICHAEL: Saint Bernard. 
MICHAEL: Sales. 
MICHAEL: Same sort of stuff in here. 
MICHAEL: Same thing. 
MICHAEL: Sandwich platters. 
MICHAEL: Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite. 
MICHAEL: Save yourself! 
MICHAEL: Saving him! David 
MICHAEL: Say hi to the kids. 
MICHAEL: Say it with an accent! 
MICHAEL: Say it. 
MICHAEL: Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head. 
MICHAEL: Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.   Clinky, clinky-clink. Come-on... come on, come on. 
MICHAEL: Scuse me! Scuse me! Andy & 
MICHAEL: See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear. 
MICHAEL: See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.  Jell-o! 
MICHAEL: See ya, drive safely. 
MICHAEL: See ya. 
MICHAEL: See you later! 
MICHAEL: See you later. 
MICHAEL: See you later.  
MICHAEL: See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim. 
MICHAEL: See you. 
MICHAEL: See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now? 
MICHAEL: See, this is a beautiful piece of material  This could be used for all sorts of things. 
MICHAEL: See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed. 
MICHAEL: See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find. 
MICHAEL: Seriously. No, really. 
MICHAEL: Sexual time bomb. 
MICHAEL: Shaaa-shut up. Hello. 
MICHAEL: Shake it, shake it! 
MICHAEL: Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent!  
MICHAEL: She already has a stroller. 
MICHAEL: She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home. 
MICHAEL: She bought it?  OK. OK. 
MICHAEL: She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here. 
MICHAEL: She can't talk to us that way. 
MICHAEL: She did it! 
MICHAEL: She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know. 
MICHAEL: She drives a green camry. 
MICHAEL: She has a boyfriend. 
MICHAEL: She is a beaut! 
MICHAEL: She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K" Karen. Pam, let's go. 
MICHAEL: She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks! 
MICHAEL: She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do. 
MICHAEL: She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right? 
MICHAEL: She poses. 
MICHAEL: She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So... 
MICHAEL: She said she was going to give it to him right now.   
MICHAEL: She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say? 
MICHAEL: She strong? 
MICHAEL: She suckered you too. 
MICHAEL: She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them. 
MICHAEL: She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy --- 
MICHAEL: She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger. 
MICHAEL: She was from Europe. 
MICHAEL: She was so innocent. 
MICHAEL: She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that. 
MICHAEL: She washes dogs. 
MICHAEL: She will have a greekaccino. 
MICHAEL: She would get this little foam mustache... 
MICHAEL: She would have definitely slept with me. 
MICHAEL: She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."  "And... and clip my toenails." 
MICHAEL: She's dead?  She's so young. 
MICHAEL: She's foreign. I am-- 
MICHAEL: She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider. 
MICHAEL: She's kind of a rube. 
MICHAEL: She's nice. 
MICHAEL: She's not playing the game. 
MICHAEL: She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so... 
MICHAEL: She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it-- 
MICHAEL: She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe? 
MICHAEL: She's right on my way home from work. 
MICHAEL: She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles. 
MICHAEL: She's your wife, you idiot. 
MICHAEL: Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please! 
MICHAEL: Shh! 
MICHAEL: Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't. 
MICHAEL: Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him. 
MICHAEL: Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it. 
MICHAEL: Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right? 
MICHAEL: Shh. 
MICHAEL: Shh. 
MICHAEL: Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad. 
MICHAEL: Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off. 
MICHAEL: Shh... 
MICHAEL: Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!  
MICHAEL: Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable.   Welcome back, Stanley. 
MICHAEL: Shhh! Hey! That's my mug. 
MICHAEL: Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay? 
MICHAEL: Shhh. 
MICHAEL: Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late. 
MICHAEL: Shhh... 
MICHAEL: Shhh... just calm down. 
MICHAEL: Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party. 
MICHAEL: Shhhh! Keep it down. 
MICHAEL: Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff. 
MICHAEL: Shoot, shoot it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up. 
MICHAEL: Shotgun! 
MICHAEL: Should've had hindsight. 
MICHAEL: Shut - 
MICHAEL: Shut it! That's...  suck up! 
MICHAEL: Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled! Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows. 
MICHAEL: Shut it.  Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes.  Say hi to Pam! Jim, Josh, and 
MICHAEL: Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot. 
MICHAEL: Shut it. Shut it. 
MICHAEL: Shut it... 
MICHAEL: Shut that off! 
MICHAEL: Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual. Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness. 
MICHAEL: Shut up! 
MICHAEL: Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd. 
MICHAEL: Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box. 
MICHAEL: Shut up, shut up. Hello? 
MICHAEL: Shut up. 
MICHAEL: Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me. 
MICHAEL: Shut up. Shut up. 
MICHAEL: Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me. 
MICHAEL: Si senor. 
MICHAEL: Sick freak! What is wrong with you? 
MICHAEL: Sign the papers at the condo. 
MICHAEL: Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent. 
MICHAEL: Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt. 
MICHAEL: Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere. 
MICHAEL: Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives? 
MICHAEL: Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch. 
MICHAEL: Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen? 
MICHAEL: Sit. Okay, just close your eyes.  
MICHAEL: Sits on a copier. 
MICHAEL: Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'. 
MICHAEL: Six percent? After all we've been through? 
MICHAEL: Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me. You two were the only ones with the stones to follow. 
MICHAEL: Six years and two months. 
MICHAEL: Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom? 
MICHAEL: Slept like a baby. 
MICHAEL: Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it. 
MICHAEL: Smell that. Do you smell that? 
MICHAEL: Smells good. 
MICHAEL: Snack attack time. 
MICHAEL: Snowboarding? 
MICHAEL: So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two. 
MICHAEL: So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town. 
MICHAEL: So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host.  And that person is  DeAngelo!  
MICHAEL: So Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's?  Go to Bernie's? 
MICHAEL: So check out how we live 
MICHAEL: So check out how we live Michael & 
MICHAEL: So close. So close. 
MICHAEL: So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller... 
MICHAEL: So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun. 
MICHAEL: So did you hear the news? 
MICHAEL: So do I sign? 
MICHAEL: So does this remind you of your childhood right now? 
MICHAEL: So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry. 
MICHAEL: So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief. 
MICHAEL: So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.  Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff? 
MICHAEL: So how are things going with Andy? 
MICHAEL: So how do you search? Sadiq (IT 
MICHAEL: So how you feeling about the new company? 
MICHAEL: So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what?  I don't care. 
MICHAEL: So I looked him in the eye and I said, "Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead." I said something like that. 
MICHAEL: So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back. 
MICHAEL: So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done. 
MICHAEL: So I wanted to give you that.  It's a letter of recommendation.  
MICHAEL: So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, "Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" And he looks at me and he says, "Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." And I look back at him and I say, "I feel the need!... The need for tweed." 
MICHAEL: So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious. 
MICHAEL: So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you? 
MICHAEL: So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go? 
MICHAEL: So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here. 
MICHAEL: So I'll know where--- 
MICHAEL: So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones. 
MICHAEL: So I'm less funny than not funny at all? 
MICHAEL: So I'm not in trouble? 
MICHAEL: So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley? 
MICHAEL: So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done. 
MICHAEL: So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so... 
MICHAEL: So it's not a free fall? Man on 
MICHAEL: So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip. 
MICHAEL: So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear? 
MICHAEL: So let's see what we can find out from reading.   Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant. 
MICHAEL: So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose. 
MICHAEL: So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right? 
MICHAEL: So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups? 
MICHAEL: So maybe. See ya. 
MICHAEL: So much for keeping our secrets up high. 
MICHAEL: So much for sex without consequences. Pam  :   You are such a dork! Shots! 
MICHAEL: So my looks have nothing to do with it? 
MICHAEL: So older people have just as many rights as younger people? 
MICHAEL: So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." I gave Ryan an iPod. 
MICHAEL: So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish? 
MICHAEL: So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes. 
MICHAEL: So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?   Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon. 
MICHAEL: So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today? 
MICHAEL: So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only. 
MICHAEL: So that just leaves Dwight and Jim. 
MICHAEL: So that's it. 
MICHAEL: So that's the problem, is solved. What? 
MICHAEL: So that's what that means. 
MICHAEL: So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus. 
MICHAEL: So the kid's making the noise to pick it up. 
MICHAEL: So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se. 
MICHAEL: So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now. 
MICHAEL: So this is Astird. 
MICHAEL: So this is one of my favorite places in the world. 
MICHAEL: So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day. 
MICHAEL: So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl   Okay.   Goodbye. 
MICHAEL: So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other. 
MICHAEL: So we should get the check? 
MICHAEL: So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?   
MICHAEL: So what did I miss? 
MICHAEL: So what was rule two? 
MICHAEL: So what you're saying is you kinda like it?  I've fallen and I can't get up!  That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good. 
MICHAEL: So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating? 
MICHAEL: So what? 
MICHAEL: So what's going on? What I miss? 
MICHAEL: So which way are you leaning? 
MICHAEL: So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera? 
MICHAEL: So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes. Mr. 
MICHAEL: So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key. 
MICHAEL: So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle! 
MICHAEL: So you don't want to end our relationship? 
MICHAEL: So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What... 
MICHAEL: So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy? 
MICHAEL: So you just rat me out? You could have said no. 
MICHAEL: So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't. 
MICHAEL: So you think you know a lot about business? 
MICHAEL: So you wanna? Thanks. 
MICHAEL: So you would think that's a good idea for me to do? 
MICHAEL: So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here.  
MICHAEL: So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? 
MICHAEL: So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so... 
MICHAEL: So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend. Travel 
MICHAEL: So, Eric. You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair. 
MICHAEL: So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock? Prince 
MICHAEL: So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs. 
MICHAEL: So, how you been? 
MICHAEL: So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job. 
MICHAEL: So, I guess we're getting back together. 
MICHAEL: So, let us consider this matter ended. 
MICHAEL: So, like a freedom tree. 
MICHAEL: So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please. 
MICHAEL: So, okay. 
MICHAEL: So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you. 
MICHAEL: So, the copier. 
MICHAEL: So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on. 
MICHAEL: So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh... 
MICHAEL: So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road? 
MICHAEL: So, what do you do? 
MICHAEL: So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special. 
MICHAEL: So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything? Dwight, Jim & 
MICHAEL: So, when, um, can I see you again? 
MICHAEL: So, why did you and Karen break up? Was it the sex? 
MICHAEL: So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or...  a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand .  Satisfied? 
MICHAEL: So, you will? 
MICHAEL: So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and... 
MICHAEL: So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it? 
MICHAEL: So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins. 
MICHAEL: So... high five me. We're back. To a happy...  look at those! Mittens. Are those a present? 
MICHAEL: So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist. 
MICHAEL: So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good? 
MICHAEL: So? I've beaten up black belts. 
MICHAEL: Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown. 
MICHAEL: Some days I am just on fire. What can I say? 
MICHAEL: Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after.   Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight? 
MICHAEL: Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular." But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly. 
MICHAEL: Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable. 
MICHAEL: Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday! 
MICHAEL: Somebody got donuts for my birthday! 
MICHAEL: Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The "Hottest in the Office" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp! 
MICHAEL: Someone complained that the men's room is "whites only". Stanley, you know that's not true. 
MICHAEL: Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now? 
MICHAEL: Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it? 
MICHAEL: Someone told me that I romanticize relationships 
MICHAEL: Something is wrong with you. 
MICHAEL: Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table. 
MICHAEL: Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation. 
MICHAEL: Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all. 
MICHAEL: Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing. 
MICHAEL: Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone   
MICHAEL: Son of a bitch. 
MICHAEL: Son of a bitch.  Pardon me. 
MICHAEL: Son of a bitch. That is impressive. 
MICHAEL: Sorry about that. What'd I miss? 
MICHAEL: Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift. 
MICHAEL: Sorry I was a jerk. 
MICHAEL: Sorry Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret? 
MICHAEL: Sorry, my meeting ran late. 
MICHAEL: Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him. 
MICHAEL: Sorry. 
MICHAEL: Sorry. Corporate policy. 
MICHAEL: Sorry. I got some stomach cramps. 
MICHAEL: Sorry? 
MICHAEL: Sound good. Sounds fun. 
MICHAEL: Sounds awesome. 
MICHAEL: Sounds good. Fudge it up!  
MICHAEL: Sounds good. OK, alright. 
MICHAEL: Sounds like a good dentist. 
MICHAEL: Sounds like fun. You guys would love it. 
MICHAEL: Spamster! 
MICHAEL: Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year. 
MICHAEL: Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute. 
MICHAEL: Spite her - ok   
MICHAEL: Sprinkles? 
MICHAEL: Squarepants? 
MICHAEL: Ssshh stupid! Um... 
MICHAEL: Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people. 
MICHAEL: Stand clear. 
MICHAEL: Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that.  But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson!  Come on up here you sick bastard. 
MICHAEL: Stanley Hudson, you are fired. 
MICHAEL: Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima. 
MICHAEL: Stanley! Bo banley. 
MICHAEL: Stanley! What? You gotta be kidding me! !?!  Oh... Here we go!  Who's on him? Somebody get him! 
MICHAEL: Stanley, we're havin a little... 
MICHAEL: Stanley, you don't need to answer that. 
MICHAEL: Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt.  May you never lose the fun loving quality in life. 
MICHAEL: Stanley. 
MICHAEL: Stanley.  
MICHAEL: Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too. 
MICHAEL: Stanley's wife is out of town. 
MICHAEL: Stanly is having a midlife crisis. 
MICHAEL: Stay- 
MICHAEL: Stay   calm! 
MICHAEL: Stay or... 
MICHAEL: Stay, stay. 
MICHAEL: Steak! Where's my steeaaak? 
MICHAEL: Stephanie could you hop off please? 
MICHAEL: Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads. 
MICHAEL: Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did. 
MICHAEL: Still not seeing the problem here. 
MICHAEL: Stop crying. 
MICHAEL: Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it! 
MICHAEL: Stop it!  
MICHAEL: Stop it! Stop it! 
MICHAEL: Stop it! Stop it! 
MICHAEL: Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it. 
MICHAEL: Stop it. 
MICHAEL: Stop it.  Stop it. 
MICHAEL: Stop it.  Stop. It.  Don't. Don't. 
MICHAEL: Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested.  Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door? 
MICHAEL: Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now. 
MICHAEL: Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you. 
MICHAEL: Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle! 
MICHAEL: Stop talking all at once! 
MICHAEL: Stop talking. 
MICHAEL: Stop the bus, okay? 
MICHAEL: Stop! Stop! Stop!  Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow. 
MICHAEL: Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible. 
MICHAEL: Stop, stop it! Stop spraying!  Gimme the bottle! 
MICHAEL: Stop, stop! Oh, my god!  Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop. 
MICHAEL: Stop. 
MICHAEL: Stop. 
MICHAEL: Stop. 
MICHAEL: Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will. 
MICHAEL: Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music. 
MICHAEL: Stop... 
MICHAEL: Strawberries? 
MICHAEL: Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me? 
MICHAEL: Stuff. I love stuff. 
MICHAEL: Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance. 
MICHAEL: Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology. 
MICHAEL: Sucks to be you. 
MICHAEL: Sure it is. 
MICHAEL: Sure thing.  'Scuse me.  
MICHAEL: Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap. 
MICHAEL: Sure we do. 
MICHAEL: Sure you can't stay a little longer? 
MICHAEL: Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem. 
MICHAEL: Sure! 
MICHAEL: Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy? 
MICHAEL: Sure. 
MICHAEL: Sure. 
MICHAEL: Sure. 
MICHAEL: Sure.  Be right out! 
MICHAEL: Sure. Kevin, please leave. 
MICHAEL: Sure. Mr. 
MICHAEL: Sure. Thanks for asking. 
MICHAEL: Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk? 
MICHAEL: Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see. 
MICHAEL: Sure. You like Cosmos? 
MICHAEL: Sure? Might be a good idea. 
MICHAEL: Surprise! 
MICHAEL: Surprise!   As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles. 
MICHAEL: Surprise! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
MICHAEL: Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go!   Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on! 
MICHAEL: SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG. 
MICHAEL: Sweet, I will go invite Holly. 
MICHAEL: T! Yes! Yes! That is a "T", and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there. 
MICHAEL: T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say "Don't go there" but that's... lame. 
MICHAEL: Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off. 
MICHAEL: Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid. 
MICHAEL: Take a sip of that.   
MICHAEL: Take hedded of. 
MICHAEL: Take heed of. 
MICHAEL: Take heed of. 
MICHAEL: Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim. 
MICHAEL: Take it back. That is absurd. 
MICHAEL: Take it easy. 
MICHAEL: Take it from Toby. 
MICHAEL: Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different. 
MICHAEL: Talk to you later--  Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye.  Alright, I am looking forward to this. 
MICHAEL: Talk! Just talk! 
MICHAEL: Talkin' bout, uh, what? 
MICHAEL: Teach her to offer Stanley more money. 
MICHAEL: Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So... 
MICHAEL: Tell him I'm retired. 
MICHAEL: Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast? 
MICHAEL: Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids? 
MICHAEL: Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips... 
MICHAEL: Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all - 
MICHAEL: Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them. 
MICHAEL: Tell them that I'm in a meeting. 
MICHAEL: Tell them what you told me. This is genius. 
MICHAEL: Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion. 
MICHAEL: Temporary workspace. You can use it. 
MICHAEL: Terrific. Good. 
MICHAEL: Testify. 
MICHAEL: Thank God. 
MICHAEL: Thank God. Pretzel 
MICHAEL: Thank vous.   What? Oh!   
MICHAEL: Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in. 
MICHAEL: Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays. 
MICHAEL: Thank you so much. 
MICHAEL: Thank you to our hosts. 
MICHAEL: Thank you very much. 
MICHAEL: Thank you very much. 
MICHAEL: Thank you very much. 
MICHAEL: Thank you very much. It is from Italy.  Actually--- no, Bulgaria. 
MICHAEL: Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that. Diane 
MICHAEL: Thank You! 
MICHAEL: Thank you!   
MICHAEL: Thank you!  What, what is this? 
MICHAEL: Thank you! Thank you! 
MICHAEL: Thank you! That's really nice. 
MICHAEL: Thank you! Wish me luck! 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Andy. 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Jim is with me. 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Kevin. 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this. 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride "Mawige... 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Stanley. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Thank you.   
MICHAEL: Thank you.  What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin? 
MICHAEL: Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here? 
MICHAEL: Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like? 
MICHAEL: Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose? 
MICHAEL: Thank you. Pam, messages please? 
MICHAEL: Thank you. Prince 
MICHAEL: Thank you. Prince 
MICHAEL: Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. Would you like some french toast? 
MICHAEL: Thank you. You remember Ryan   And Pam is around here somewhere. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. You too. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. You, too.  
MICHAEL: Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Thanks a bunch. 
MICHAEL: Thanks Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Thanks for having me. 
MICHAEL: Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight.  
MICHAEL: Thanks Jim. 
MICHAEL: Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet. 
MICHAEL: Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore.  Wanna share? 
MICHAEL: Thanks, Kevin. Um...  
MICHAEL: Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here? Business Student 
MICHAEL: Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning. Co-Worker 
MICHAEL: Thanks, Steve. 
MICHAEL: Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy. 
MICHAEL: Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I... 
MICHAEL: Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Thanks.  
MICHAEL: Thanks.   Andy? 
MICHAEL: Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies? 
MICHAEL: Thanks. Today helped. 
MICHAEL: That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset. 
MICHAEL: That could not possibly be it. 
MICHAEL: That does sound fun to me. 
MICHAEL: That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice. 
MICHAEL: That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock. 
MICHAEL: That good? 
MICHAEL: That got a big laugh. 
MICHAEL: That guy's got more than he can handle as it is. 
MICHAEL: That is a good point. 
MICHAEL: That is a great idea JB. 
MICHAEL: That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future? 
MICHAEL: That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart. 
MICHAEL: That is a very good point, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: That is a very, very funny story. 
MICHAEL: That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican. 
MICHAEL: That is Beardy. 
MICHAEL: That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core. 
MICHAEL: That is cool. Is that like the Robot? 
MICHAEL: That is crooked on that side. 
MICHAEL: That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant. 
MICHAEL: That is full of soup. Blood 
MICHAEL: That is how you do it. 
MICHAEL: That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in. 
MICHAEL: That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him. 
MICHAEL: That is just so disgusting! 
MICHAEL: That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings. 
MICHAEL: That is neat. 
MICHAEL: That is not a very nice thing to say about him. 
MICHAEL: That is not big picture. 
MICHAEL: That is not constructive. 
MICHAEL: That is not current. 
MICHAEL: That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day. 
MICHAEL: That is not the way I heard it. 
MICHAEL: That is not what Wallace told us. 
MICHAEL: That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you. 
MICHAEL: That is ridiculous. 
MICHAEL: That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives. 
MICHAEL: That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan? 
MICHAEL: That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that? 
MICHAEL: That is the way Southern people talk. 
MICHAEL: That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot. 
MICHAEL: That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client. 
MICHAEL: That is true. 
MICHAEL: That is true. 
MICHAEL: That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times. 
MICHAEL: That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka. 
MICHAEL: That is worse. 
MICHAEL: That is.  It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there. 
MICHAEL: That is... who makes that? 
MICHAEL: That kid's going to have a lot of hair. 
MICHAEL: That makes sense because he has elfish features. 
MICHAEL: That marriage would be a sham. 
MICHAEL: That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam? 
MICHAEL: That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed. 
MICHAEL: --that none of us can be a part of-- 
MICHAEL: That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops. 
MICHAEL: That s what she said. 
MICHAEL: That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know. 
MICHAEL: That sounds good.  Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go. 
MICHAEL: That sounds good. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual. Mr. 
MICHAEL: That sounds like it was hilarious. 
MICHAEL: That sounds pretty biased. 
MICHAEL: That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing? 
MICHAEL: That waitress was the one. 
MICHAEL: That was a bunt. 
MICHAEL: That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus. 
MICHAEL: That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own. 
MICHAEL: That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it. 
MICHAEL: That was a really good choice. David 
MICHAEL: That was a really sucky thing to do. David 
MICHAEL: That was awesome. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot...  ...of water. Diane 
MICHAEL: That was deer!? Gross, oh! 
MICHAEL: That was embarrassing. 
MICHAEL: That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go? 
MICHAEL: That was fun. 
MICHAEL: That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people! 
MICHAEL: That was funny. Let's go do it to somebody else. Ayyyy! 
MICHAEL: That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This-- 
MICHAEL: That was helping. It was classic. 
MICHAEL: That was hilarious. The foam ... 
MICHAEL: That was mean. Blood 
MICHAEL: That was nice of you. 
MICHAEL: That was not scripted. 
MICHAEL: That was Packer! Oh, you're... you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar... Oh, God! Of course it was you. 
MICHAEL: That was really fun last night. 
MICHAEL: That was the worst joke ever. 
MICHAEL: That was us, right there. 
MICHAEL: That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me. 
MICHAEL: That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better. 
MICHAEL: That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you? 
MICHAEL: That will not go over well. 
MICHAEL: That would be bad. 
MICHAEL: That would be hot. I would pay to see that. 
MICHAEL: That would be sublime. 
MICHAEL: That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act. 
MICHAEL: That would never happen. 
MICHAEL: That you are afraid. 
MICHAEL: That... exists? 
MICHAEL: That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming? 
MICHAEL: That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to... 
MICHAEL: That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. 
MICHAEL: That? In the conference room? 
MICHAEL: That'a girl. 
MICHAEL: That's- 
MICHAEL: That's -- thanks. 
MICHAEL: That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope. 
MICHAEL: That's a dog. 
MICHAEL: That's a drive! 
MICHAEL: That's a good deal. 
MICHAEL: That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way. 
MICHAEL: That's a little much. All right, all right, all right. 
MICHAEL: That's a lot of zeroes. 
MICHAEL: That's a nice tie. 
MICHAEL: That's a pun. 
MICHAEL: That's a really pretty song. 
MICHAEL: That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you. 
MICHAEL: That's a shawl. 
MICHAEL: That's adorable. 
MICHAEL: That's all, you didn't mean it? 
MICHAEL: That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time. 
MICHAEL: That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got?   You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work.     Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate. 
MICHAEL: That's exactly what I was thinking. 
MICHAEL: That's from Superman? 
MICHAEL: That's fun. 
MICHAEL: That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational. 
MICHAEL: That's funny. 
MICHAEL: That's good to know.  
MICHAEL: That's good. 
MICHAEL: That's good. 
MICHAEL: That's good. 
MICHAEL: That's good. He's throwing it. 
MICHAEL: That's good. Pleasure to meet you. 
MICHAEL: That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good. 
MICHAEL: That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me? 
MICHAEL: That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  See? Everybody has a chance! 
MICHAEL: That's great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride? Robert 
MICHAEL: That's her? 
MICHAEL: That's his profit. 
MICHAEL: That's how devoted I am to this job. 
MICHAEL: That's insane! 
MICHAEL: That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it. 
MICHAEL: That's ironic. 
MICHAEL: That's it! 
MICHAEL: That's it! Hotel 
MICHAEL: That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go. 
MICHAEL: That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act. 
MICHAEL: That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me? 
MICHAEL: That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom. 
MICHAEL: That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery. 
MICHAEL: That's just an arbitrary title. 
MICHAEL: That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just... 
MICHAEL: That's my car. 
MICHAEL: THAT'S MY CAR. 
MICHAEL: That's my corner. 
MICHAEL: That's my joke, damnit Dwight. Lab 
MICHAEL: That's my wife you're talking about, man. 
MICHAEL: That's nice though. 
MICHAEL: That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude. 
MICHAEL: That's not- 
MICHAEL: That's not a baby. 
MICHAEL: That's not a joke. 
MICHAEL: That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider. 
MICHAEL: That's not gonna happen. 
MICHAEL: That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man. 
MICHAEL: That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun. 
MICHAEL: That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap. 
MICHAEL: That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.  
MICHAEL: That's not true. 
MICHAEL: That's not true.  You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan. 
MICHAEL: That's not what you said earlier. 
MICHAEL: That's okay. 
MICHAEL: That's one of 'em! Yes. These are our demands. This is what we want. Our balls are in your court. 
MICHAEL: That's over several months, Ryan. 
MICHAEL: That's perfect. 
MICHAEL: That's possible. 
MICHAEL: That's possible. Look into that. 
MICHAEL: That's really nice of you to say. 
MICHAEL: That's ridiculous. 
MICHAEL: That's right! 
MICHAEL: That's right! I am not thinking. 
MICHAEL: That's right! That's right! 
MICHAEL: That's right, let's do this. 
MICHAEL: That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up. 
MICHAEL: That's right. 
MICHAEL: That's rude. 
MICHAEL: That's so spicy. 
MICHAEL: That's sorta secondary.  
MICHAEL: That's still going on? 
MICHAEL: That's stupid. 
MICHAEL: That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright?  Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words. 
MICHAEL: That's the whole point, dummy. 
MICHAEL: That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right. 
MICHAEL: That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what- 
MICHAEL: That's true, we wouldn't get seats together. 
MICHAEL: That's true. 
MICHAEL: That's true. People say it's icky. 
MICHAEL: That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out? 
MICHAEL: That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there. 
MICHAEL: That's very rude. 
MICHAEL: That's what faggie means! 
MICHAEL: That's what I do, steal my trick. 
MICHAEL: That's what I said. 
MICHAEL: That's what I said. That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing. 
MICHAEL: That's what I'm talking about! 
MICHAEL: That's what I've heard. 
MICHAEL: That's what makes him classy. 
MICHAEL: That's what makes it so wrong. 
MICHAEL: That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks!  Whoa. Ad guy 
MICHAEL: That's what she sai  Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself. 
MICHAEL: THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! 
MICHAEL: That's what she said! 
MICHAEL: That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: That's what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ? 
MICHAEL: That's what she said. Pam? 
MICHAEL: That's what she... 
MICHAEL: That's what she... a lot of places are like that. 
MICHAEL: That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different? 
MICHAEL: That's what you're going to do, Luke! 
MICHAEL: That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault. 
MICHAEL: That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier. 
MICHAEL: That's why you made the decision. That's why you made... 
MICHAEL: That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that. 
MICHAEL: That's, that is true.  
MICHAEL: That's, whatever stupid show you want- 
MICHAEL: That's... I, I think that... 
MICHAEL: That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth. 
MICHAEL: That's... they always give an ultimatum. 
MICHAEL: That's... What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting.  Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?! 
MICHAEL: That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy.  Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves- 
MICHAEL: The "Spicy Curry" award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor! Get on up here. Here you go. 
MICHAEL: The aye's have it. 
MICHAEL: The best. 
MICHAEL: The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't... 
MICHAEL: The CFO? Ohh... 
MICHAEL: The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays. 
MICHAEL: The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight. 
MICHAEL: The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on. 
MICHAEL: The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention. 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider. 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider. 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton. 
MICHAEL: The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. "Mental" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it. 
MICHAEL: The gabba-gool. 
MICHAEL: The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead. 
MICHAEL: The guys at the papermill--- No no no! 
MICHAEL: The important thing is... this kept us secure people. 
MICHAEL: The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start. 
MICHAEL: The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible." 
MICHAEL: The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful. 
MICHAEL: The joke's on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist. 
MICHAEL: The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike. Second 
MICHAEL: The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest. Jim & 
MICHAEL: The machine knows--- stop yelling at me! 
MICHAEL: The machine knows where it is going! 
MICHAEL: The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice.  
MICHAEL: The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis? 
MICHAEL: The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones. 
MICHAEL: The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist. 
MICHAEL: The office. 
MICHAEL: The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott. They are in for a bitter surprise. I am not to be truffled with. 
MICHAEL: The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that. 
MICHAEL: The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave. 
MICHAEL: The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it? 
MICHAEL: The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited. 
MICHAEL: The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not. 
MICHAEL: The pressures of my office are insane. 
MICHAEL: The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything. 
MICHAEL: The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother. 
MICHAEL: The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them. 
MICHAEL: The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body. 
MICHAEL: The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout "shotgun" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion. 
MICHAEL: The sales department smashed my sandwich. 
MICHAEL: The same stuff you get downtown. 
MICHAEL: The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes? 
MICHAEL: The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip. David 
MICHAEL: The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"... 
MICHAEL: The watermark... it's a one time thing. 
MICHAEL: The waving? Ad guy 
MICHAEL: The what now? 
MICHAEL: The what? 
MICHAEL: The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy. 
MICHAEL: The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world. 
MICHAEL: The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright? 
MICHAEL: The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it. 
MICHAEL: The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt.  Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So...  That's Uh... Robotic 
MICHAEL: The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt! 
MICHAEL: The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship. 
MICHAEL: Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this.   
MICHAEL: Then I will name your team the Red team. 
MICHAEL: Then I'll give you away! 
MICHAEL: Then listen to your iPod, Pam. 
MICHAEL: Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone. 
MICHAEL: There an accident? Somebody hurt? 
MICHAEL: There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie!  
MICHAEL: There are certain defining moments in a person's life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it. 
MICHAEL: There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails. 
MICHAEL: There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. "I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head."  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams. 
MICHAEL: There are copies in the bathroom? 
MICHAEL: There are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job. 
MICHAEL: There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work.  He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well. 
MICHAEL: There are ten rules of business that you need to learn. Number 
MICHAEL: There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em. 
MICHAEL: There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue. My little heart can barely take it no more.  Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time. 
MICHAEL: There he goes. There he goes.  
MICHAEL: There he is! Hello, hello! 
MICHAEL: There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard.  He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs. 
MICHAEL: There he is. 
MICHAEL: There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight! 
MICHAEL: There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba - 
MICHAEL: There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. 
MICHAEL: There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like... 
MICHAEL: There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke. 
MICHAEL: There is no such things as monsters. 
MICHAEL: There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please! 
MICHAEL: There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player. 
MICHAEL: There is stink in there, my God! What is... what is that? 
MICHAEL: There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees. 
MICHAEL: There she is - Jan Levinson. First... 
MICHAEL: There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde.  
MICHAEL: There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake? 
MICHAEL: There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family. 
MICHAEL: There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks. 
MICHAEL: There they are. What's up? Hey hey. 
MICHAEL: There we go.  Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts . 
MICHAEL: There we go. Our town car awaits. 
MICHAEL: There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual. 
MICHAEL: There will be food. You leave, you do not get food. 
MICHAEL: There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover. 
MICHAEL: There you are. I don't think we have finished with my Inbox. 
MICHAEL: There you go! Where's the other? 
MICHAEL: There you go, fresh from the warehouse. 
MICHAEL: There you go. 
MICHAEL: There you go. 
MICHAEL: There you go. 
MICHAEL: There, there... 
MICHAEL: There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down. 
MICHAEL: There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers. 
MICHAEL: There's a guy, there's a guy. 
MICHAEL: There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler. 
MICHAEL: There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam. 
MICHAEL: There's gonna be a free room? 
MICHAEL: There's no downsizing. 
MICHAEL: There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody.  
MICHAEL: There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that? 
MICHAEL: There's no way I'm gonna do that. 
MICHAEL: There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend. 
MICHAEL: There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today. 
MICHAEL: There's the x-ax...icks. 
MICHAEL: There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so... 
MICHAEL: There's... a name. 
MICHAEL: These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook! 
MICHAEL: These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'. 
MICHAEL: These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun. 
MICHAEL: These are our demands. 
MICHAEL: These are shaped like paper. 
MICHAEL: These meetings are useless. 
MICHAEL: These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole. 
MICHAEL: These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it. 
MICHAEL: These people need love and I am going to get it for them Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else. I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say "I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow." Funny little bird, but he gets the job done. 
MICHAEL: They act like I have no power. 
MICHAEL: They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get? 
MICHAEL: They are correct, sir. Financial 
MICHAEL: They are into appearance. We are selling success. 
MICHAEL: They are into style. 
MICHAEL: They are nifty! They're nifty gifties. 
MICHAEL: They are not. Yes, they are.  That's my girlfriend. 
MICHAEL: They call it Scranton! 
MICHAEL: They call it Scranton! 
MICHAEL: They call it Scranton. 
MICHAEL: They could be shrinking. 
MICHAEL: They could call at any second now.  Oh God...I better call. 
MICHAEL: They did this up in Albany... 
MICHAEL: They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on. 
MICHAEL: They don't know that! 
MICHAEL: They have a TCBY booth. 
MICHAEL: They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom. 
MICHAEL: They have one of those? 
MICHAEL: They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it. 
MICHAEL: They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto them pills, just in case. 
MICHAEL: They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy's play, they took mine. 
MICHAEL: They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad. 
MICHAEL: They sent a limo. 
MICHAEL: They sound great. 
MICHAEL: They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out. 
MICHAEL: They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes. 
MICHAEL: They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir. 
MICHAEL: They were engaged, so...  Okay, you know what, sir? Hayworth's 
MICHAEL: They were so happy down there. 
MICHAEL: They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt. 
MICHAEL: They were. 
MICHAEL: They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock.   
MICHAEL: They wouldn't make it unless people liked it. 
MICHAEL: They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam!  
MICHAEL: They're cool. 
MICHAEL: They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim. 
MICHAEL: They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema. 
MICHAEL: They're good  
MICHAEL: They're good, huh? 
MICHAEL: They're men, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom. 
MICHAEL: They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away. 
MICHAEL: Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life? Somebody has a gun.  That's why I always start with a gun, because you can't top it, you just can't. Girl acting 
MICHAEL: Think of it as part of your training. 
MICHAEL: Thirty. 
MICHAEL: This  Why would somebody throw that out? 
MICHAEL: This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you. 
MICHAEL: This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute? 
MICHAEL: This guy does it all. 
MICHAEL: This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.  Right? Would you agree with that? 
MICHAEL: This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise. 
MICHAEL: This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love. 
MICHAEL: This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now. 
MICHAEL: This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone. 
MICHAEL: This is a little character I like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters.  Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.  "Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin." Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.  
MICHAEL: This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei. 
MICHAEL: This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before. 
MICHAEL: This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I. 
MICHAEL: This is all we need. 
MICHAEL: This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her. 
MICHAEL: This is bull****! 
MICHAEL: This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze. 
MICHAEL: This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will "do" you.  No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know? 
MICHAEL: THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious! 
MICHAEL: This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything. 
MICHAEL: This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler.  Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali! 
MICHAEL: This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed.  IT Tech 
MICHAEL: This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her.  I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah. 
MICHAEL: This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler. 
MICHAEL: This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation. 
MICHAEL: This is great. 
MICHAEL: This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing. 
MICHAEL: This is it, check that out, can you smell that?  
MICHAEL: This is it. 
MICHAEL: This is it. What do you think? 
MICHAEL: This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes. 
MICHAEL: This is Michael. 
MICHAEL: This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder. 
MICHAEL: This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall.  used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.  
MICHAEL: This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance. 
MICHAEL: This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask? 
MICHAEL: This is none of your affair because she is your boss- 
MICHAEL: This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir. 
MICHAEL: This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience. 
MICHAEL: This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that. 
MICHAEL: This is perfect. 
MICHAEL: This is plenty complicated. 
MICHAEL: This is probably the icebreaker you need. 
MICHAEL: This is Scott. 
MICHAEL: This is so stupid. 
MICHAEL: This is so, so stupid. And, God...   that's my phone. 
MICHAEL: This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: This is the party. 
MICHAEL: This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey . That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi?  OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey.  Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh. 
MICHAEL: This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it! 
MICHAEL: This is Tito. 
MICHAEL: This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.   Hank, could you come up here please? Hank is our security guard-- 
MICHAEL: This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it? 
MICHAEL: This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead. 
MICHAEL: This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls! 
MICHAEL: This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives. 
MICHAEL: This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these?  You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions? 
MICHAEL: This is where the magic happens. 
MICHAEL: This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here. 
MICHAEL: This is where we first kissed. 
MICHAEL: This is you we're talking about. 
MICHAEL: This is you. How much do you charge? 
MICHAEL: This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy? 
MICHAEL: This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap. 
MICHAEL: This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that. 
MICHAEL: This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it. 
MICHAEL: This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange   
MICHAEL: This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer. 
MICHAEL: This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.  
MICHAEL: This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out. 
MICHAEL: This place is like sexy pre-school. 
MICHAEL: This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison. 
MICHAEL: This place is so cursed. 
MICHAEL: This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it. 
MICHAEL: This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days. 
MICHAEL: This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me. 
MICHAEL: This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home. 
MICHAEL: This was Jim's idea? 
MICHAEL: This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them. 
MICHAEL: This way to the partay bus. 
MICHAEL: This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits. 
MICHAEL: This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest. Billy 
MICHAEL: This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness.  Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall. 
MICHAEL: This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh? 
MICHAEL: This'll be  the day that I died. 
MICHAEL: Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel. 
MICHAEL: Those are real cops, real guns. I wonder what's going on.   
MICHAEL: Those glasses are super dark. 
MICHAEL: Those people will be ruined.   
MICHAEL: Thought I'd catch a show. 
MICHAEL: Thought so too. 
MICHAEL: Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould. 
MICHAEL: Threat neutralized. 
MICHAEL: Three hours, wow. Have fun.  
MICHAEL: Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes. 
MICHAEL: Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap. 
MICHAEL: Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are.  Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got? 
MICHAEL: Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to. 
MICHAEL: Titanic? 
MICHAEL: T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness. 
MICHAEL: To be continued! 
MICHAEL: To Can-A-da. 
MICHAEL: To change lives. 
MICHAEL: To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great. 
MICHAEL: To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever. 
MICHAEL: To Mama Juju Boo Boo. 
MICHAEL: To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty. 
MICHAEL: To save time, Jim. 
MICHAEL: To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity. 
MICHAEL: To the left? 
MICHAEL: To the right? 
MICHAEL: To throw you off the scent. 
MICHAEL: To watch tonight 
MICHAEL: To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace? 
MICHAEL: Toaster Oven 101? 
MICHAEL: Toby can I see those? Ooh.   What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared? 
MICHAEL: Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left? 
MICHAEL: Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap.  But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.  The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.  Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite.  
MICHAEL: Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family. 
MICHAEL: Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go! 
MICHAEL: Toby, can I really tell you anything? 
MICHAEL: Toby, come on. Let's go. 
MICHAEL: Toby, Katy. 
MICHAEL: Toby. 
MICHAEL: Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right? 
MICHAEL: Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, "This might be kinda fun." And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together. 
MICHAEL: Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me. 
MICHAEL: Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment.  A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally  Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  Some people shouldn't be in this business. 
MICHAEL: Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place. 
MICHAEL: Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." I dunno, it's a good feeling. 
MICHAEL: Today is about family. 
MICHAEL: Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited. 
MICHAEL: Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a perfect ice-breaker if I ever meet Terry Hatcher. 
MICHAEL: Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity. 
MICHAEL: Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring? Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well I say that an empty desk means a... 
MICHAEL: Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days. 
MICHAEL: Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down. 
MICHAEL: Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate. 
MICHAEL: Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English? 
MICHAEL: Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by   Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace.   He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad. 
MICHAEL: Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you... 
MICHAEL: Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So... 
MICHAEL: Toga! 
MICHAEL: Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge... 
MICHAEL: Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom. 
MICHAEL: Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright? 
MICHAEL: Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin.  And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me." Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So... 
MICHAEL: Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good. 
MICHAEL: Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds- 
MICHAEL: Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it  it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great.  Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween. 
MICHAEL: Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it. 
MICHAEL: Tonight? 
MICHAEL: Tonight's so... 
MICHAEL: Too expensive. 
MICHAEL: Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day. 
MICHAEL: Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.' 
MICHAEL: Took me all night. 
MICHAEL: Top 80 percent! 
MICHAEL: Top of the Sunday morning to you. 
MICHAEL: Totally your call babe. 
MICHAEL: Toward the sun. 
MICHAEL: Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me. 
MICHAEL: Traitor. You are a traitor. 
MICHAEL: Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer? 
MICHAEL: Trouble. Okay, alright. 
MICHAEL: Try "profits". No! Try "Michael Scott". "Michael" "boss" and "funny".  Oh my God, wow!  E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, Terribly nice guy.  "Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late." Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers. 
MICHAEL: Try 80. 
MICHAEL: Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you.  
MICHAEL: Try 'Control P'. 
MICHAEL: Try not to be so hurtful Jim. 
MICHAEL: Tube City, you owe me one. 
MICHAEL: Turn around, turn around. Come on.  
MICHAEL: Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people!  Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished. 
MICHAEL: Twenty years. 
MICHAEL: Twice. ... Right? 
MICHAEL: Two are for souvenirs. 
MICHAEL: Two fifteenths. 
MICHAEL: Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head. 
MICHAEL: Two minutes apart. 
MICHAEL: Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it. 
MICHAEL: Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody. 
MICHAEL: Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said. 
MICHAEL: Type O-Ocean Spray. Blood 
MICHAEL: Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room. 
MICHAEL: Uck... T.M.I. 
MICHAEL: Ugh! 
MICHAEL: Ugh! God! What happened to you people?   We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work. 
MICHAEL: Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?  
MICHAEL: Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God! 
MICHAEL: Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam. 
MICHAEL: Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet. 
MICHAEL: Ugh, what? 
MICHAEL: Ugh. 
MICHAEL: Ugh. 
MICHAEL: Ugh. 
MICHAEL: Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define "begin". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago. 
MICHAEL: Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today. 
MICHAEL: Ugh...  I'm in. 
MICHAEL: Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter. 
MICHAEL: Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment. 
MICHAEL: Ughh... Blech. 
MICHAEL: Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices. 
MICHAEL: Uh huh, uh huh.  Power trip. 
MICHAEL: Uh huh. 
MICHAEL: Uh huh. 
MICHAEL: Uh huh.  Alright? 
MICHAEL: Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out. 
MICHAEL: Uh huh... 
MICHAEL: Uh huh... 
MICHAEL: Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o! 
MICHAEL: Uh oh. Todd 
MICHAEL: Uh,  "I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword." 
MICHAEL: Uh,  MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery. 
MICHAEL: Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something? 
MICHAEL: Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you? 
MICHAEL: Uh, duh. 
MICHAEL: Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits? 
MICHAEL: Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins. 
MICHAEL: Uh, hey... Creed? 
MICHAEL: Uh, huh. 
MICHAEL: Uh, I better tell somebody.  Excuse me, sir... 
MICHAEL: Uh, I don't know what you mean. Todd 
MICHAEL: Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that. 
MICHAEL: Uh, I don't need one. 
MICHAEL: Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen. 
MICHAEL: Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another. 
MICHAEL: Uh, I'll drive. 
MICHAEL: Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron. 
MICHAEL: Uh, Jan, what happened? 
MICHAEL: Uh, just a few more items. 
MICHAEL: Uh, just never happened. 
MICHAEL: Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Uh, nine. 
MICHAEL: Uh, no, no, no Gould. 
MICHAEL: Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks. 
MICHAEL: Uh, nope. 
MICHAEL: Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it. 
MICHAEL: Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok? Why don't you just go... away? 
MICHAEL: Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through?  Hi buddy. 
MICHAEL: Uh, okay. 
MICHAEL: Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN! 
MICHAEL: Uh, well I'm afraid not. Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance. 
MICHAEL: Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out. 
MICHAEL: Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now. 
MICHAEL: Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning. 
MICHAEL: Uh, what flavor? 
MICHAEL: Uh, what the hell is happening? 
MICHAEL: Uh, wh-why would she say that? 
MICHAEL: Uh, yeah, sure. 
MICHAEL: Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will... 
MICHAEL: Uh, yes you are. 
MICHAEL: Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May. 
MICHAEL: Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um... 
MICHAEL: Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh... 
MICHAEL: Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding. 
MICHAEL: Uh.  
MICHAEL: Uh. Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Uh... 
MICHAEL: Uh... 
MICHAEL: Uh... 
MICHAEL: Uh... 
MICHAEL: Uh... 
MICHAEL: Uh... 
MICHAEL: Uh... "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?"  Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right? 
MICHAEL: Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection. 
MICHAEL: Uh... it was like eight years ago? 
MICHAEL: Uh... no. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it? 
MICHAEL: Uh... Ten year. 
MICHAEL: Uh... that I have not decided yet. 
MICHAEL: Uh... try "password". 
MICHAEL: Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail. 
MICHAEL: Uhh, I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information. 
MICHAEL: Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy? 
MICHAEL: Uhhgh. 
MICHAEL: Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right? 
MICHAEL: Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm...  
MICHAEL: Uhhh... nothing. 
MICHAEL: Uh-huh. 
MICHAEL: Uh-huh. 
MICHAEL: Uh-huh. 
MICHAEL: Uh-huh.   Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner.   At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up.   Here he is. 
MICHAEL: Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis.  I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong. 
MICHAEL: Uh-huh? 
MICHAEL: Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty. 
MICHAEL: Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin? 
MICHAEL: Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi. 
MICHAEL: Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this. 
MICHAEL: Um it is, Grotti. Andy and 
MICHAEL: Um, 
MICHAEL: Um, 
MICHAEL: Um, come on. 
MICHAEL: Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show's just getting started. 
MICHAEL: Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings.  Couldn't find the knob. 
MICHAEL: Um, how many people are you interviewing? 
MICHAEL: Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  
MICHAEL: Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is. 
MICHAEL: Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just- 
MICHAEL: Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them? 
MICHAEL: Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time. 
MICHAEL: Um, I... 
MICHAEL: Um, I'll... I have to think about it. 
MICHAEL: Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive? 
MICHAEL: Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes. 
MICHAEL: Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way. 
MICHAEL: Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool? 
MICHAEL: Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler? 
MICHAEL: Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars. 
MICHAEL: Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke. 
MICHAEL: Um, not personally, no. 
MICHAEL: Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.  
MICHAEL: Um, oh, thinking about business school? 
MICHAEL: Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do. 
MICHAEL: Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. 
MICHAEL: Um, sort of a spy, thriller... 
MICHAEL: Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable. 
MICHAEL: Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying? 
MICHAEL: Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez. 
MICHAEL: Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk. 
MICHAEL: Um, what do you play? Center? 
MICHAEL: Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...  
MICHAEL: Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day. 
MICHAEL: Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges. 
MICHAEL: Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin. 
MICHAEL: Um. 
MICHAEL: Um. Dwight and 
MICHAEL: Um. I'd like to see a menu please. 
MICHAEL: Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me. 
MICHAEL: Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did. 
MICHAEL: Um. Oh.  Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off? 
MICHAEL: Um. Okay, um. 
MICHAEL: Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do. 
MICHAEL: Um... 
MICHAEL: Um... 
MICHAEL: Um...  
MICHAEL: Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed.  I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are? 
MICHAEL: Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay? 
MICHAEL: Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind? 
MICHAEL: Um... literally two seconds? 
MICHAEL: Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison.  No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool! 
MICHAEL: Um... Me no get an agenda. 
MICHAEL: Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why. 
MICHAEL: Um... that wasn't much of an introduction. 
MICHAEL: Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise. 
MICHAEL: Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so... 
MICHAEL: Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday. 
MICHAEL: Umm, hmm? 
MICHAEL: Umm, hmmm. 
MICHAEL: Umm, nacho chips. 
MICHAEL: Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging? Tech 
MICHAEL: Umm... I don't know? Average kind? 
MICHAEL: Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met. 
MICHAEL: Ummm... I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Ummm-hmmm... 
MICHAEL: Unbelievable! Unbelievable. 
MICHAEL: Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame. Liquor Store 
MICHAEL: Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those  are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.  
MICHAEL: Ungh, this is not looking good Pam! 
MICHAEL: Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call. 
MICHAEL: Up and over. 
MICHAEL: Up and over. 
MICHAEL: Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her. 
MICHAEL: Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products. 
MICHAEL: Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero. 
MICHAEL: Uuf, well... 
MICHAEL: Very comedically humorous Jim. 
MICHAEL: Very cool. 
MICHAEL: Very easy to clean.  
MICHAEL: Very good  
MICHAEL: Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.  
MICHAEL: Very good. 
MICHAEL: Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic. 
MICHAEL: Very inspirational.  
MICHAEL: Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here. Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable. 
MICHAEL: Very nice. 
MICHAEL: Very nice. 
MICHAEL: Very nice. 
MICHAEL: Very perfect.  Oh my  This needs to be shared.   
MICHAEL: Very valid. 
MICHAEL: Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it? 
MICHAEL: Video games. 
MICHAEL: Vikram doesn't have my people skills. 
MICHAEL: Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a... Captain 
MICHAEL: Waa... what? What are you talking about? 
MICHAEL: Wait a minute. 
MICHAEL: Wait a second, are you listening to music? 
MICHAEL: Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary. 
MICHAEL: Wait a second.   I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me. 
MICHAEL: Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks. 
MICHAEL: Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's.  Do you think that this is a game? 
MICHAEL: Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me? 
MICHAEL: Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three? 
MICHAEL: Wait, do we have until the end of the day? 
MICHAEL: Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true? 
MICHAEL: Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend? 
MICHAEL: Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why? 
MICHAEL: Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take? 
MICHAEL: Wait, wait. Check one more time. 
MICHAEL: Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance. 
MICHAEL: Wait, where are the warehouse guys? 
MICHAEL: Wait, you still don't know... 
MICHAEL: Wait. 
MICHAEL: Wait. What day is today? 
MICHAEL: Wait. You forgetting something? 
MICHAEL: Walk with me. 
MICHAEL: Walk with me. 
MICHAEL: Walking in the door... Mr. 
MICHAEL: Walking out of the room unexpectedly. 
MICHAEL: Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed. 
MICHAEL: Wallace is going to freak. 
MICHAEL: Wanna come over Friday? 
MICHAEL: Wanna head back? 
MICHAEL: Want some pie? 
MICHAEL: Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath"- 
MICHAEL: Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting? 
MICHAEL: Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point? 
MICHAEL: Was it nice? 
MICHAEL: Was it the cleavage? 
MICHAEL: Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING!  
MICHAEL: Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey-- come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do. 
MICHAEL: Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost. 
MICHAEL: Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage? 
MICHAEL: Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp. 
MICHAEL: Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you. 
MICHAEL: Watch out, Pam. You're next! 
MICHAEL: Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!  Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go.  I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler.  
MICHAEL: We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's. 
MICHAEL: We already have a buyer. 
MICHAEL: We already have a sofa. So why do--- 
MICHAEL: We are a law firm. Prince 
MICHAEL: We are getting there folks. Slow and steady.   Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo! David 
MICHAEL: We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing. 
MICHAEL: We are going to choose team names. Dwight? 
MICHAEL: We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right?  Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on. 
MICHAEL: We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you. Michael and 
MICHAEL: We are great together. We are a great team. Uncle 
MICHAEL: We are in the heart of it.   And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea. 
MICHAEL: We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby. 
MICHAEL: We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way? 
MICHAEL: We are so rich. 
MICHAEL: We are, we are a family. 
MICHAEL: We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day. 
MICHAEL: We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me. 
MICHAEL: We are? 
MICHAEL: We can do this. 
MICHAEL: We can do... 
MICHAEL: We can talk about that.  All right. 
MICHAEL: We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.  
MICHAEL: We could do a movie... sort of thing. 
MICHAEL: We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything. 
MICHAEL: We could go there, sure. 
MICHAEL: We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move... 
MICHAEL: We did it! 
MICHAEL: We did it! 
MICHAEL: We did it? We did it. 
MICHAEL: We did? 
MICHAEL: We didn't break up. 
MICHAEL: We didn't get it. 
MICHAEL: We don't know if it's dead. 
MICHAEL: We don't need luck. 
MICHAEL: We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors? 
MICHAEL: We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states. 
MICHAEL: We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket. 
MICHAEL: We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier. 
MICHAEL: We got it. 
MICHAEL: We gotta do something.  This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not... 
MICHAEL: We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans. 
MICHAEL: We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing... unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan. 
MICHAEL: We have a history... 
MICHAEL: We have a little song prepared for you. 
MICHAEL: We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today. 
MICHAEL: We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?  
MICHAEL: We have a monthly staff meeting 
MICHAEL: We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool.  The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow!  
MICHAEL: We have fun. 
MICHAEL: We have nowhere else Jan. This... 
MICHAEL: We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later? 
MICHAEL: We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously. Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area. 
MICHAEL: We have to put an end to this. 
MICHAEL: We like Cugino's 
MICHAEL: We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black. 
MICHAEL: We need to sell her an elevator pass. 
MICHAEL: We ought to have this thing serviced. 
MICHAEL: We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts. 
MICHAEL: We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump. 
MICHAEL: We should come up with a signal of some sort. 
MICHAEL: We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda. 
MICHAEL: We should have your contract done by Thursday. 
MICHAEL: We should invite them to the Christmas party. 
MICHAEL: We should look into that. Or we just go for the loft. David 
MICHAEL: We take separate cars. 
MICHAEL: We tell them the plan, right? 
MICHAEL: We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking-- 
MICHAEL: We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free. Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad. 
MICHAEL: We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon. 
MICHAEL: We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright? 
MICHAEL: We were more than we were. 
MICHAEL: We will demonstrate on Pam. 
MICHAEL: We will find another way, we'll ask power-point. 
MICHAEL: We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines? 
MICHAEL: We would have twins.  
MICHAEL: We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again. 
MICHAEL: Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages. 
MICHAEL: Weird... 
MICHAEL: Welcome back! How was your vacation? 
MICHAEL: Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community. 
MICHAEL: Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here. 
MICHAEL: Welcome to your future. 
MICHAEL: Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader. 
MICHAEL: Welcome. 
MICHAEL: Welcome. 
MICHAEL: Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss. 
MICHAEL: Well- 
MICHAEL: Well- 
MICHAEL: Well- 
MICHAEL: Well- 
MICHAEL: Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store. 
MICHAEL: Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people. 
MICHAEL: Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame. 
MICHAEL: We'll do it quickly. 
MICHAEL: Well done. 
MICHAEL: Well get on it. And make it happen. 
MICHAEL: We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please. 
MICHAEL: Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa. 
MICHAEL: Well here we all are. Alone but together. No flowers for us.   Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships. I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan? He treated you pretty terribly, yeah? 
MICHAEL: Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name. 
MICHAEL: Well how do you think I feel? I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy. Every night, a different woman. Being oogled. Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful. 
MICHAEL: Well I believe in love at first sight. 
MICHAEL: Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing. 
MICHAEL: Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done .  Very well. Then you are all punished. 
MICHAEL: Well I have interviews. 
MICHAEL: Well I hope I make it. 
MICHAEL: Well I think we're past that now. 
MICHAEL: Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch. Hot Dog 
MICHAEL: Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever. 
MICHAEL: Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela?   Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are...   Oscar, you're gay. 
MICHAEL: Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy  may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day. 
MICHAEL: Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that. David 
MICHAEL: Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim. 
MICHAEL: Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey!   I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper. 
MICHAEL: Well it can wait. It can wait. 
MICHAEL: Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend. 
MICHAEL: Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious. 
MICHAEL: Well it sounds right, but is it? 
MICHAEL: Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company... 
MICHAEL: Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager. 
MICHAEL: Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice. 
MICHAEL: Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket. Larry 
MICHAEL: Well no harm no foul. 
MICHAEL: We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready? 
MICHAEL: Well put it aside.   Umm... yeah. 
MICHAEL: Well some of us are trying to have a... 
MICHAEL: Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological. 
MICHAEL: Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well. 
MICHAEL: We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right? 
MICHAEL: Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate -  
MICHAEL: Well that goes without saying. 
MICHAEL: Well that is all in the past. David 
MICHAEL: Well that is... because... I am a genius. Prince 
MICHAEL: Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager. 
MICHAEL: Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point- 
MICHAEL: Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make--- 
MICHAEL: Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Well the number three is not such a giant feast. 
MICHAEL: Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen... 
MICHAEL: Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine. 
MICHAEL: Well then I won't get a warrantee. 
MICHAEL: Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him! 
MICHAEL: Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity. 
MICHAEL: Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk. 
MICHAEL: Well there's no jumping in a triathlon. 
MICHAEL: Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it? 
MICHAEL: Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with. 
MICHAEL: Well this is it. I am here to see you off. 
MICHAEL: Well we can do better than that. Ad guy 
MICHAEL: Well we did talk about how handsome you are. 
MICHAEL: Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing. 
MICHAEL: Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright.   Okay... 
MICHAEL: Well what am I supposed to do? 
MICHAEL: Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other... 
MICHAEL: Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you. 
MICHAEL: Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one 
MICHAEL: Well you don't need two of you to do that. 
MICHAEL: Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam. 
MICHAEL: Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch. 
MICHAEL: Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company! 
MICHAEL: Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist. 
MICHAEL: Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many. 
MICHAEL: Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada. 
MICHAEL: Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd. 
MICHAEL: Well you tried. 
MICHAEL: Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly. 
MICHAEL: Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition. Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition. I'm so, so sorry. 
MICHAEL: Well,  busier. Making the time. 
MICHAEL: Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down? 
MICHAEL: Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled. 
MICHAEL: Well, actually, it's my warehouse. 
MICHAEL: Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos. 
MICHAEL: Well, at least you're still being honest with me. 
MICHAEL: Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag. 
MICHAEL: Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'. 
MICHAEL: Well, can't Alan protect you? 
MICHAEL: Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there? Jerome 
MICHAEL: Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan? 
MICHAEL: Well, could you condense it please? 
MICHAEL: Well, deal with this.  
MICHAEL: Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it. 
MICHAEL: Well, don't let it happen again. 
MICHAEL: Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people. 
MICHAEL: Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you? 
MICHAEL: Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else. 
MICHAEL: Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival. 
MICHAEL: Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm... 
MICHAEL: Well, he is. 
MICHAEL: Well, he needs a permanent number, right? 
MICHAEL: Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling. 
MICHAEL: Well, he... 
MICHAEL: Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's. 
MICHAEL: Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't. Mr. 
MICHAEL: Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts. 
MICHAEL: Well, hobbies-- 
MICHAEL: Well, I- 
MICHAEL: Well, I am heading down there. 
MICHAEL: Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna... 
MICHAEL: Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and - 
MICHAEL: Well, I am starting it again! 
MICHAEL: Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious. 
MICHAEL: Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you. 
MICHAEL: Well, I call it fun! 
MICHAEL: Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar.  Oh... 
MICHAEL: Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me! 
MICHAEL: Well, I don't really have two heads. So... 
MICHAEL: Well, I find it beautiful. 
MICHAEL: Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut . 
MICHAEL: Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring. 
MICHAEL: Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.   And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting. 
MICHAEL: Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So - 
MICHAEL: Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner. 
MICHAEL: Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation. 
MICHAEL: Well, I hope this conversation has helped. 
MICHAEL: Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me. 
MICHAEL: Well, I just like to look good OK, so --- 
MICHAEL: Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there. 
MICHAEL: Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what? 
MICHAEL: Well, I ran down Meredith in my car. 
MICHAEL: Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage. 
MICHAEL: Well, I think I can get through the door. 
MICHAEL: Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him. 
MICHAEL: Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith. 
MICHAEL: Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic.   
MICHAEL: Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects. 
MICHAEL: Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket... 
MICHAEL: Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business. 
MICHAEL: Well, I... it could be either of us. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good. 
MICHAEL: Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules. 
MICHAEL: Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. 
MICHAEL: Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest-- 
MICHAEL: Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going. Improv 
MICHAEL: Well, if you have a question, you should ask me. 
MICHAEL: Well, if you like her so much, don't give up. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'll be in my office. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready. Wendy's phone 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm not really one for making speeches. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm texting him, so. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like... 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm writing a message. 
MICHAEL: Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal- 
MICHAEL: Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: Well, it has always been a lifelong dream. 
MICHAEL: Well, it has certain connotations. 
MICHAEL: Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!' 
MICHAEL: Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you. Bar 
MICHAEL: Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly.  Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess  and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try. 
MICHAEL: Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day. 
MICHAEL: Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears. 
MICHAEL: Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior. 
MICHAEL: Well, it's a pretty big check. 
MICHAEL: Well, it's a suicide mission, you know. 
MICHAEL: Well, it's mostly made up. So... 
MICHAEL: Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged. 
MICHAEL: Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down. 
MICHAEL: Well, it's not official. 
MICHAEL: Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh. 
MICHAEL: Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em. 
MICHAEL: Well, it's, it's- 
MICHAEL: Well, it's...  No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK. 
MICHAEL: Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it. 
MICHAEL: Well, just shhhh... just just... 
MICHAEL: Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K? 
MICHAEL: Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you. 
MICHAEL: Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won. 
MICHAEL: Well, let's keep this party movin' on. 
MICHAEL: Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok. 
MICHAEL: Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman. 
MICHAEL: Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo. 
MICHAEL: Well, let's... 
MICHAEL: Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.  OK, yes that would be bad. 
MICHAEL: Well, maybe I did. 
MICHAEL: Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot... 
MICHAEL: Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths. 
MICHAEL: Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. Toby Flenderson is doing drugs. 
MICHAEL: Well, no no no no no... 
MICHAEL: Well, no. 
MICHAEL: Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack. 
MICHAEL: Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys. Warehouse 
MICHAEL: Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do.  
MICHAEL: Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired. 
MICHAEL: Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally. 
MICHAEL: Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this? Mr. 
MICHAEL: Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance? 
MICHAEL: Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth? Hot Dog 
MICHAEL: Well, okay, lets go. 
MICHAEL: Well, okay. Different management styles. 
MICHAEL: Well, okay... 
MICHAEL: Well, okay... 
MICHAEL: Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts.  
MICHAEL: Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration. 
MICHAEL: Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam.   No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter.   Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy. 
MICHAEL: Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings. 
MICHAEL: Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time. 
MICHAEL: Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history. 
MICHAEL: Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'. 
MICHAEL: Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay? 
MICHAEL: Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have!  Nice, huh? 
MICHAEL: Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost. 
MICHAEL: Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's. 
MICHAEL: Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month. 
MICHAEL: Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott. 
MICHAEL: Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior. 
MICHAEL: Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you? 
MICHAEL: Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about. 
MICHAEL: Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice. 
MICHAEL: Well, that is not gonna happen! 
MICHAEL: Well, that is probably from the test drive. 
MICHAEL: Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow. 
MICHAEL: Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "I'm sleeping with your wife." And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond. 
MICHAEL: Well, that... 
MICHAEL: Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good! 
MICHAEL: Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor. Billy 
MICHAEL: Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember.  That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you - 
MICHAEL: Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character? 
MICHAEL: Well, thats... 
MICHAEL: Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too. 
MICHAEL: Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike. 
MICHAEL: Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half. 
MICHAEL: Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu. 
MICHAEL: Well, then he's not a senator. 
MICHAEL: Well, then I will get a warrantee. 
MICHAEL: Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try. 
MICHAEL: Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane. 
MICHAEL: Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good. 
MICHAEL: Well, then, they need our money more than ever. 
MICHAEL: Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does! 
MICHAEL: Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy. 
MICHAEL: Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin! 
MICHAEL: Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts. 
MICHAEL: Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later. 
MICHAEL: Well, they're sold out. 
MICHAEL: Well, this is a work related matter. 
MICHAEL: Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal. 
MICHAEL: Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool. 
MICHAEL: Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa. 
MICHAEL: Well, this... 
MICHAEL: Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there. Todd 
MICHAEL: Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back. 
MICHAEL: Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words. 
MICHAEL: Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support. Captain 
MICHAEL: Well, we are extremely sorry. 
MICHAEL: Well, we are running a business, so. 
MICHAEL: Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan. 
MICHAEL: Well, we don't-- Financial 
MICHAEL: Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or- 
MICHAEL: Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already. 
MICHAEL: Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that.  
MICHAEL: Well, we'll squeeze you in. 
MICHAEL: Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk. 
MICHAEL: Well, what should I do? 
MICHAEL: Well, what? You could be referring to anything. 
MICHAEL: Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work. 
MICHAEL: Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love. 
MICHAEL: Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Well, who's that one? 
MICHAEL: Well, why don't- 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around. 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah, I mean, what is... 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it. 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis. 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah. 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car? 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah... 
MICHAEL: Well, yes I would. And I would survive. 
MICHAEL: Well, you are boner-ific.  
MICHAEL: Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party. 
MICHAEL: Well, you can't get diseases from a bird! 
MICHAEL: Well, you can't swim in leather pants.  I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally. 
MICHAEL: Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home. 
MICHAEL: Well, you didn't even hear it. 
MICHAEL: Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby. 
MICHAEL: Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly. 
MICHAEL: Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family. 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess. 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So... 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on. 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good? 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head! 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work! 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem. 
MICHAEL: Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time. 
MICHAEL: Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool. 
MICHAEL: Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in. 
MICHAEL: Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em. 
MICHAEL: Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore. 
MICHAEL: Well, you're not a romantic. 
MICHAEL: Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry. 
MICHAEL: Well, you're wearing it at the office. And  it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy. 
MICHAEL: Well. 
MICHAEL: Well. 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MICHAEL: Well...  OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill--- 
MICHAEL: Well... bleh busted. I don't... 
MICHAEL: Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great! Captain 
MICHAEL: Well... I didn't know they didn't know. 
MICHAEL: Well... I don't know if that's a good idea. 
MICHAEL: Well... I guess we should go tell the troops. 
MICHAEL: Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day. 
MICHAEL: Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up. Business Student 
MICHAEL: Well... s-sure I can. 
MICHAEL: Well... That's my watch. 
MICHAEL: Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right? 
MICHAEL: Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for. 
MICHAEL: Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can. Dwight 
MICHAEL: Well? 
MICHAEL: Well? 
MICHAEL: We're all gonna have a good time tonight! Captain 
MICHAEL: We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you. 
MICHAEL: We're circling it. 
MICHAEL: We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.   Hey. Hey. You shaved? 
MICHAEL: We're going out of business! 
MICHAEL: We're going to ... 
MICHAEL: We're going to have a baby. 
MICHAEL: We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on. 
MICHAEL: We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright? 
MICHAEL: We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song. Michael and 
MICHAEL: We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand! 
MICHAEL: We're havin a little brainstorm session... 
MICHAEL: We're just friends.   Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know. 
MICHAEL: We're making love! Michael and 
MICHAEL: We're never going to find those leads, are we?  
MICHAEL: We're not- 
MICHAEL: We're not doing anything. 
MICHAEL: We're not fired? 
MICHAEL: We're not hiring, Jim. 
MICHAEL: We're not supposed to PDA. 
MICHAEL: We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers. 
MICHAEL: We're not. 
MICHAEL: We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is? 
MICHAEL: We're party girls. 
MICHAEL: We're really close. 
MICHAEL: We're so alike. So alike.  
MICHAEL: We're totally alone. 
MICHAEL: We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please? 
MICHAEL: We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right? 
MICHAEL: We're watching it. 
MICHAEL: We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us. 
MICHAEL: Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek? 
MICHAEL: We're, uh, we're doing okay. A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun. Uh, yep. We have 20-- of those. 
MICHAEL: Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write? 
MICHAEL: We've almost got it. Push it! Push it! 
MICHAEL: Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy. 
MICHAEL: Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso. 
MICHAEL: Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine. 
MICHAEL: Wha- what? 
MICHAEL: Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him. 
MICHAEL: Wha? Really? You should! It's fun. 
MICHAEL: Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends? 
MICHAEL: Whass...up! 
MICHAEL: Whassup! 
MICHAEL: Whassup! 
MICHAEL: What a disaster, this whole thing. 
MICHAEL: What a douche bag! 
MICHAEL: What a horrible day. 
MICHAEL: What a tool.  What? 
MICHAEL: What about a rabies nurse? 
MICHAEL: What about a raise based on merit? 
MICHAEL: What about her looks? 
MICHAEL: What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous? 
MICHAEL: What about Oscar? 
MICHAEL: What about our truce? 
MICHAEL: What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us. 
MICHAEL: What about the rest of you?   
MICHAEL: What about... 
MICHAEL: What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good. 
MICHAEL: What am I supposed to do here? 
MICHAEL: What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight? 
MICHAEL: What am I supposed to do with this? Cherokee 
MICHAEL: What are our plans for tonight? Umm... 
MICHAEL: What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing? 
MICHAEL: What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples. 
MICHAEL: What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car. 
MICHAEL: What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened. 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing?  
MICHAEL: What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just -- 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you gonna call him? 
MICHAEL: What are you looking for? You bring dip? 
MICHAEL: What are you reading? 
MICHAEL: What are you talking about-- 
MICHAEL: What are you wearing? 
MICHAEL: What are you writing?   
MICHAEL: What are you...  Improv 
MICHAEL: What are you? IT Tech 
MICHAEL: What are your symptoms? 
MICHAEL: What are... That's insane. 
MICHAEL: What are... What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not.  Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this. 
MICHAEL: What can I do? 
MICHAEL: What did I say? 
MICHAEL: What did I say? 
MICHAEL: What did you get tonight? 
MICHAEL: What did you just thought? 
MICHAEL: What did you think was going to happen? 
MICHAEL: What difference does it make whether your here? 
MICHAEL: What do I have to live for? 
MICHAEL: What do I write under "reason for visit"? 
MICHAEL: What do we got? 
MICHAEL: What do we got? Creed, disqualified. 
MICHAEL: What do you guys think?  
MICHAEL: What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So... 
MICHAEL: What do you like best about Pam? 
MICHAEL: What do you like Pam? 
MICHAEL: What do you mean by "these people"? 
MICHAEL: What do you race cars? 
MICHAEL: What do you say, Jan? 
MICHAEL: What do you say? 
MICHAEL: What do you think? What do you think of this place? 
MICHAEL: What do you want Dwight? 
MICHAEL: What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business? 
MICHAEL: What do you want me to do Jim? 
MICHAEL: What does a great manager need most of all? Courage. 
MICHAEL: What does that even mean? That is impossible. 
MICHAEL: What does that mean? 
MICHAEL: What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure? 
MICHAEL: What does warm mean? 
MICHAEL: What does what mean? 
MICHAEL: What for? 
MICHAEL: What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting. 
MICHAEL: What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head. 
MICHAEL: What has gotten into you? 
MICHAEL: What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'. 
MICHAEL: What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend? 
MICHAEL: What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic. 
MICHAEL: What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work?  Would that be crossing the line? 
MICHAEL: What if she makes me? 
MICHAEL: What if they made out? In front of everybody? 
MICHAEL: What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under? 
MICHAEL: What I'm saying is that,  
MICHAEL: What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more.  
MICHAEL: What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for?  
MICHAEL: What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening? 
MICHAEL: What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results. 
MICHAEL: What is it? 
MICHAEL: What is it? 
MICHAEL: What is it? 
MICHAEL: What is it? No, just tell me what it is. 
MICHAEL: What is Jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That 's bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you there has been work everyday. Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here. 
MICHAEL: What is October feast? 
MICHAEL: What is taking someone from behind? 
MICHAEL: What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House. 
MICHAEL: What is that smaller stripper holding? 
MICHAEL: What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here? 
MICHAEL: What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow? 
MICHAEL: What is that... word? 
MICHAEL: What is that? 
MICHAEL: What is that? 
MICHAEL: What is that? A squid's eye or... 
MICHAEL: What is that? Dwight, are you peeing? 
MICHAEL: What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked. 
MICHAEL: What is the world's largest ocean? 
MICHAEL: What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not? 
MICHAEL: What is this meeting about? 
MICHAEL: What is up with you two, Holly? 
MICHAEL: What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry. 
MICHAEL: What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years. 
MICHAEL: What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel! 
MICHAEL: What is your problem? 
MICHAEL: What is your problem?! 
MICHAEL: What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter? 
MICHAEL: What kind of toppings would you like? 
MICHAEL: What old days? What are you talking about? 
MICHAEL: What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car. 
MICHAEL: What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves. 
MICHAEL: What punch? 
MICHAEL: What shape? 
MICHAEL: What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point. 
MICHAEL: What table should we take? So many to choose from. 
MICHAEL: What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse. 
MICHAEL: What the hell are you reading to them? 
MICHAEL: What the hell is a terrarium? 
MICHAEL: What the hell is going on here?! 
MICHAEL: What the hell is going on? 
MICHAEL: What the hell is that? 
MICHAEL: What the hell was that? 
MICHAEL: What the hell was that?   
MICHAEL: What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time? 
MICHAEL: What up? 
MICHAEL: What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish. 
MICHAEL: What would you like for Christmas little boy? 
MICHAEL: What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life? 
MICHAEL: What you mean uh hmmm... ? 
MICHAEL: What you talking bout, Wallace?   
MICHAEL: What!? 
MICHAEL: What!? 
MICHAEL: What, are you talking about me and Holly? 
MICHAEL: What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir. 
MICHAEL: What, um... what do you think of role-play? 
MICHAEL: What... 
MICHAEL: What... can I do, for you? 
MICHAEL: What?

MICHAEL: What? 
MICHAEL: What? 
MICHAEL: What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow! 
MICHAEL: What? Blood Drive 
MICHAEL: What? Come on. It's time for grapes.  Real fun day. 
MICHAEL: What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes? 
MICHAEL: What? I told them busiest...idiots. 
MICHAEL: What? Limo 
MICHAEL: What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss. 
MICHAEL: What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please... 
MICHAEL: What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous. 
MICHAEL: What? No, she didn't say that. 
MICHAEL: What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm. 
MICHAEL: What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other... 
MICHAEL: What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you. 
MICHAEL: What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right? 
MICHAEL: What? Oh.  
MICHAEL: What? Part of your duties are to what? 
MICHAEL: What? Problem solved. 
MICHAEL: What? Really? 
MICHAEL: What? Really? That stinks! 
MICHAEL: What? Shut up. 
MICHAEL: What? Video 
MICHAEL: What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said. 
MICHAEL: What? Wha? You said ten. 
MICHAEL: What? What does that even... 
MICHAEL: What? What I'm saying... 
MICHAEL: What? What? 
MICHAEL: What? What? We did? Dwight and 
MICHAEL: What?! 
MICHAEL: What?! 
MICHAEL: What?! That would've solved all my problems. 
MICHAEL: Whatcha got? 
MICHAEL: What'cha talking about?  Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think--- 
MICHAEL: What'd you have, Stanley? 
MICHAEL: Whatever David wants. 
MICHAEL: Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see? 
MICHAEL: Whatever you guys did earlier. 
MICHAEL: Whatever you say babe. 
MICHAEL: Whatever, yeah. Financial 
MICHAEL: Whatever. 
MICHAEL: What're you talking about? 
MICHAEL: What're you wearing? 
MICHAEL: What's a bad idea? 
MICHAEL: What's a Nazi? 
MICHAEL: What's going on? 
MICHAEL: What's going on? Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right? Prince 
MICHAEL: What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls. 
MICHAEL: What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome. 
MICHAEL: What's happening? 
MICHAEL: What's his name? 
MICHAEL: What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles? 
MICHAEL: What's that, pipsqueak? 
MICHAEL: What's that? 
MICHAEL: What's that? 
MICHAEL: What's that? 
MICHAEL: What's the matter... haaaww! 
MICHAEL: What's the matter? 
MICHAEL: What's the only thing worse than one HR rep? 
MICHAEL: What's the pink? 
MICHAEL: What's the problem? 
MICHAEL: What's this? 
MICHAEL: What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime. David 
MICHAEL: What's up spinsters? 
MICHAEL: What's up? 
MICHAEL: What's up? 
MICHAEL: What's up? 
MICHAEL: What's up-dog? 
MICHAEL: What's wrong? Where's your costume? 
MICHAEL: What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason? 
MICHAEL: Whatta we got? 
MICHAEL: When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire. 
MICHAEL: When did this happen? 
MICHAEL: When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her. 
MICHAEL: When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles. 
MICHAEL: When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone. 
MICHAEL: When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so... 
MICHAEL: When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we- 
MICHAEL: When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that. 
MICHAEL: When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back. 
MICHAEL: When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being. 
MICHAEL: When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another. 
MICHAEL: When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children. 
MICHAEL: When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office . Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy. 
MICHAEL: When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me. 
MICHAEL: When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday. 
MICHAEL: When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So... That was the worst birthday I think I ever had. 
MICHAEL: When in Rome. 
MICHAEL: When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "Survivorman." And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed. 
MICHAEL: When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet. 
MICHAEL: When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute.  And she still is. 
MICHAEL: When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours. 
MICHAEL: When we were going out? 
MICHAEL: When will she be ready? 
MICHAEL: When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him? 
MICHAEL: When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation. 
MICHAEL: When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me. 
MICHAEL: When you know, you just know. 
MICHAEL: When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman-- 
MICHAEL: When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in! 
MICHAEL: Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles. 
MICHAEL: WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY? 
MICHAEL: Where are the yams? 
MICHAEL: Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there? 
MICHAEL: Where did you get your outfit? 
MICHAEL: Where do you wanna go? Second 
MICHAEL: Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up. 
MICHAEL: Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours. 
MICHAEL: Where is my cornbread? 
MICHAEL: Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go. 
MICHAEL: Where were you this morning? 
MICHAEL: Where you from? 
MICHAEL: Where you going? 
MICHAEL: Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride. 
MICHAEL: Where? 
MICHAEL: Where? Bar 
MICHAEL: Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go. 
MICHAEL: Where'd you eat? 
MICHAEL: Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are.  
MICHAEL: Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin!  
MICHAEL: Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma. 
MICHAEL: Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan. 
MICHAEL: Whew, oh God.  Laying a base. Laying a base... 
MICHAEL: Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days.   Blood 
MICHAEL: Which is it more of? David 
MICHAEL: Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie.  I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer! 
MICHAEL: Which will be fine. I am off! 
MICHAEL: While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society. 
MICHAEL: Whispering and tickling have their place in business. 
MICHAEL: Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually. 
MICHAEL: Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals. 
MICHAEL: Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there? 
MICHAEL: Who do you think it should be? 
MICHAEL: Who eats eight protein bars? 
MICHAEL: Who else here is single? 
MICHAEL: Who else knows? 
MICHAEL: Who else? 
MICHAEL: Who else? Who else? Ryan? 
MICHAEL: Who enjoys the weekends?  Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did.  And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out. 
MICHAEL: Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else? 
MICHAEL: Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him! 
MICHAEL: Who is D. Abramson? 
MICHAEL: Who is Dr. Perry? I... 
MICHAEL: Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke? Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night? 
MICHAEL: Who is he? 
MICHAEL: Who is it? Who's the birthday? 
MICHAEL: Who is this? How did you get this number? 
MICHAEL: Who is? 
MICHAEL: Who likes Threat 
MICHAEL: Who should be the judges and juries of our society? 
MICHAEL: Who should it come from, then? 
MICHAEL: Who the hell is this? Who is this guy? 
MICHAEL: Who wants candy? 
MICHAEL: Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  Alright, good. 
MICHAEL: Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod? 
MICHAEL: Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really   Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important. 
MICHAEL: Who you dating? 
MICHAEL: Who. 
MICHAEL: Who? 
MICHAEL: Who? 
MICHAEL: Who? 
MICHAEL: Who? 
MICHAEL: Who? 
MICHAEL: Who? 
MICHAEL: Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary? 
MICHAEL: Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay. 
MICHAEL: Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please. 
MICHAEL: Whoa! 
MICHAEL: Whoa! 
MICHAEL: Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey... 
MICHAEL: Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide. 
MICHAEL: Whoa, whoa! 
MICHAEL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, calm down, breathe. 
MICHAEL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? 
MICHAEL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay. 
MICHAEL: Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize? 
MICHAEL: Whoa. What are those stains? 
MICHAEL: Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away. 
MICHAEL: Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . . 
MICHAEL: Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos! 
MICHAEL: Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday. 
MICHAEL: Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh... 
MICHAEL: Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down. 
MICHAEL: Whoo! 
MICHAEL: Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! 
MICHAEL: Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.   So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may.   Ok... lower the mic for the midget. 
MICHAEL: Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch? 
MICHAEL: Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting. 
MICHAEL: Whoop! Okay, what? 
MICHAEL: Who's Amanda Bynes? 
MICHAEL: Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and-- 
MICHAEL: Who's got Roy?  
MICHAEL: Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare. 
MICHAEL: Who's next? 
MICHAEL: Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today. 
MICHAEL: Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep. 
MICHAEL: Who's that? Who's that guy?  
MICHAEL: Who's the boy toy? 
MICHAEL: Who's there? 
MICHAEL: Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo... 
MICHAEL: Wh-Why not? 
MICHAEL: Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing? 
MICHAEL: Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them. 
MICHAEL: Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number 
MICHAEL: Why are you dressed like that? 
MICHAEL: Why are you here? 
MICHAEL: Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party. 
MICHAEL: Why are you telling me this? 
MICHAEL: Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS. 
MICHAEL: Why aren't they building it themselves? 
MICHAEL: Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six.  
MICHAEL: Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable? 
MICHAEL: Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities. 
MICHAEL: Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend. 
MICHAEL: Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake. 
MICHAEL: Why did you do that? 
MICHAEL: Why did you just say he was the boss? 
MICHAEL: Why didn't you just say that, Pam? 
MICHAEL: Why do I have to explain everything? 
MICHAEL: Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings. 
MICHAEL: Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me. 
MICHAEL: Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it. 
MICHAEL: Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly. 
MICHAEL: Why do you hate her? 
MICHAEL: Why do you have a diary? 
MICHAEL: Why do you lie, liar? 
MICHAEL: Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is? 
MICHAEL: Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody. 
MICHAEL: Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job. 
MICHAEL: Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand. 
MICHAEL: Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly. 
MICHAEL: Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship? 
MICHAEL: Why don't we just, live and let live? 
MICHAEL: Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up? 
MICHAEL: Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it? 
MICHAEL: Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five. 
MICHAEL: Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p. 
MICHAEL: Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it. 
MICHAEL: Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay? 
MICHAEL: Why don't you go with him? 
MICHAEL: Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God!  Dude, where's my office?  I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest! 
MICHAEL: Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly. 
MICHAEL: Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me! 
MICHAEL: Why don't you run them again? 
MICHAEL: Why don't you tell us? 
MICHAEL: Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun. 
MICHAEL: Why don't... hey. 
MICHAEL: Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone. That's respect. 
MICHAEL: Why Improv 
MICHAEL: Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message? 
MICHAEL: Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us? 
MICHAEL: Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4? Prince 
MICHAEL: Why is today a special day? 
MICHAEL: Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it? 
MICHAEL: Why me? 
MICHAEL: Why not? 
MICHAEL: Why not? It's part of the sales experience. 
MICHAEL: Why on earth would we give you a raise? 
MICHAEL: Why privately? 
MICHAEL: Why quick? 
MICHAEL: Why so you can do it? 
MICHAEL: Why thank you very much.   Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please! 
MICHAEL: Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company. 
MICHAEL: Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us. 
MICHAEL: Why would I do that? 
MICHAEL: Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her. 
MICHAEL: Why would we do that? 
MICHAEL: Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote? 
MICHAEL: Why, is there an untapped gay market? 
MICHAEL: Why... are you here? 
MICHAEL: Why... why are you making this so hard? 
MICHAEL: Why? 
MICHAEL: Why? 
MICHAEL: Why? 
MICHAEL: Why? 
MICHAEL: Why? 
MICHAEL: Why? 
MICHAEL: Why? 
MICHAEL: Why? 
MICHAEL: Why? 
MICHAEL: Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump." 
MICHAEL: Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's... 
MICHAEL: Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful.  "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!" 
MICHAEL: Why? I'm not your father.  All right. 
MICHAEL: Why? Well, theft and stealing. 
MICHAEL: Why? Wha... 
MICHAEL: Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay? 
MICHAEL: W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms. 
MICHAEL: Wikipedia. 
MICHAEL: Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information. 
MICHAEL: Will they throw their hats, you think? 
MICHAEL: Will you? 
MICHAEL: Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work. 
MICHAEL: Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't. 
MICHAEL: Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So... 
MICHAEL: Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday. 
MICHAEL: With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like. 
MICHAEL: With that I can buy... half the menu. Hot Dog 
MICHAEL: With tolerance. Mr. 
MICHAEL: With us? 
MICHAEL: Woah, wow, who told you that? 
MICHAEL: Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God. 
MICHAEL: Women in the workplace... yeah, translation "I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls." Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh! 
MICHAEL: Wonder what I would've been back home? 
MICHAEL: Woo hoo!  
MICHAEL: Woo hoo, shout out! 
MICHAEL: Woo hoo. 
MICHAEL: Woo! 
MICHAEL: Woo! 
MICHAEL: WOO! Alright! 
MICHAEL: Woo! Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh. 
MICHAEL: Woooah! Wow! 
MICHAEL: Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me. 
MICHAEL: Work it out amongst your selves! 
MICHAEL: Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff. 
MICHAEL: Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie... 
MICHAEL: Worse than that. 
MICHAEL: Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars?   
MICHAEL: Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them. 
MICHAEL: Would she get into trouble? 
MICHAEL: Would someone just make the copy? 
MICHAEL: Would you come with me? You know, like old times, instead of...  
MICHAEL: Would you excuse me for a second? 
MICHAEL: Would you have sex with Meredith? 
MICHAEL: Would you like fries with that? Please drive around. 
MICHAEL: Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company? 
MICHAEL: Would you like to dance? 
MICHAEL: Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us? 
MICHAEL: Would you like to help me with a special project? 
MICHAEL: Would you stop it, please? 
MICHAEL: Wouldn't that be fun? 
MICHAEL: Wow! 
MICHAEL: Wow! 
MICHAEL: Wow! 
MICHAEL: Wow! 
MICHAEL: Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us .   Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish. 
MICHAEL: Wow! What happened in there? 
MICHAEL: Wow! Who opened the morgue for this thing? I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in.  There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it. Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!  Oh, come on! That guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it! I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs. I got next, I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok? Where's that wine? 
MICHAEL: Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you! 
MICHAEL: Wow! You did these... freehand? 
MICHAEL: Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today. 
MICHAEL: Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy... 
MICHAEL: Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories. 
MICHAEL: Wow, Kevin, really? We're-  Sorry. We're in the middle of a party.  Is this why you called me down here? 
MICHAEL: Wow, man. That - 
MICHAEL: Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end. 
MICHAEL: Wow, really? 
MICHAEL: Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh? 
MICHAEL: Wow, terminator, terminator. 
MICHAEL: Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour? 
MICHAEL: Wow, that sounds so... warm. 
MICHAEL: Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night? Kelly's 
MICHAEL: Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen.   Ahh! 
MICHAEL: Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque.  
MICHAEL: Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about? 
MICHAEL: Wow. 
MICHAEL: Wow. 
MICHAEL: Wow. 
MICHAEL: Wow. 
MICHAEL: Wow.  That's exciting. 
MICHAEL: Wow.  What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible. 
MICHAEL: Wow. High score? 
MICHAEL: Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you!  Are you nauseous? 
MICHAEL: Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say. 
MICHAEL: Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Kelly's 
MICHAEL: Wow. Oh, yummy.  You have got the life, my friend. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you - 
MICHAEL: Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Really terrific. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Robert 
MICHAEL: Wow. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much. 
MICHAEL: Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right? 
MICHAEL: Wow. That just-- you've really grown. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Things are really picking up. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that? 
MICHAEL: Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported. 
MICHAEL: Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight... 
MICHAEL: Wow... that is insane!  
MICHAEL: Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier.   Man, this must be torture for you. 
MICHAEL: Write it down. 
MICHAEL: Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please. 
MICHAEL: Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles. 
MICHAEL: Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So... 
MICHAEL: WUPHF! 
MICHAEL: Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan. 
MICHAEL: Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan--- 
MICHAEL: W-why did you... 
MICHAEL: WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA! 
MICHAEL: Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun? 
MICHAEL: Yaaaaay. 
MICHAEL: Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now. 
MICHAEL: Ye - OK, yes. 
MICHAEL: Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just-- 
MICHAEL: Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want. 
MICHAEL: Yeah-- 
MICHAEL: Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you   if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man? 
MICHAEL: Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody. 
MICHAEL: Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim. 
MICHAEL: Yeah I'm good. 
MICHAEL: Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up. 
MICHAEL: Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too. 
MICHAEL: Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales. Pizza 
MICHAEL: Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work! 
MICHAEL: Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay. Business Student 
MICHAEL: Yeah that sounds good. 
MICHAEL: Yeah that's fine. 
MICHAEL: Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving. 
MICHAEL: Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica? 
MICHAEL: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: yeah! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Yeah!  Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something. 
MICHAEL: Yeah!  It's a Christmas miracle! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland. 
MICHAEL: Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do? 
MICHAEL: Yeah! My last physical when I was forty. 
MICHAEL: Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline. 
MICHAEL: Yeah! Oh ho ho  
MICHAEL: Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, "So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?" 
MICHAEL: Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them. 
MICHAEL: Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!   
MICHAEL: Yeah,  . Come on, anybody. Let it fly. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus.  Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, a little bit. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one.  
MICHAEL: Yeah, baby! 
MICHAEL: Yeah, baby, here we go! 
MICHAEL: Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.   Okay, sorry, let's, who else? Oscar. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, can I point something out to you? Blood 
MICHAEL: Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, do it! 
MICHAEL: Yeah, do you? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I- 
MICHAEL: Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see.  There we go!  Good. Yes, we have the... all right.  
MICHAEL: Yeah, good job. Well done. Sweeney 
MICHAEL: Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day.  
MICHAEL: Yeah, Have a seat. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, he is that good-looking. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, here we go. Ok. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers.  
MICHAEL: Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I am. I am. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles? Hayworth's 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I do. My word against yours. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I figured that. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I get those every day after work. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I gotta get in on this.  Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk! 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'.   Umm... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I hate that. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I have fun. Girl in 2nd 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I hear ya. It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy. So if you think you're hurting... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know. Ad guy 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody. Kevin & 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know. I know. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I noticed that. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I think that's pretty boss. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas. Pizza 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected... Sadiq (IT 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm betting one more. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm good. You good? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.   
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm pretty excited too. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline! 
MICHAEL: Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well- 
MICHAEL: Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.' 
MICHAEL: Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, it's a business lunch. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay? Police Officer 
MICHAEL: Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!  
MICHAEL: Yeah, maybe.  
MICHAEL: Yeah, me too. Blood 
MICHAEL: Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, no, it's nobody. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, nothing. How was your day? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.   
MICHAEL: Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go!   Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, oh there you go. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, OK. Well, he only gets better. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, okay. Call the school, cancel. I can't go through with this. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, paper business. Is this done? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, right here. It is right there.  Anybody read the news any more? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, she does - she loves purple.  Does it stink? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, she does all that. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, so there you go. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, sure. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, tell me about it. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, that sounds good. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, that's smart. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right?  No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, the Commish. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, they used to. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, we locked him up for two years. David 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well duh. Where ya headed? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that? Chad 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, why don't you do that? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up! 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here.  Here we go. Three!  Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone! 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  Hey, hey, you know what? You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah. The Shield. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school? Business Student 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies, but... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, You love him right?  You love him. I can tell. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, you took it too slow. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs! 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah.  "Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you." Here you go. 
MICHAEL: Yeah.  Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Yeah.  Wow. I just miss you so much. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. But one would be good. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or... 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Do you have any ice? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Edward R. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Fine. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Go ahead. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I am. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.   Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I just sort've had a feeling about him. I have a feeling about you too. Michael and 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I saved 3 years salary. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I withdrew too. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you... What do you... 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Maybe next year. Todd 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Mmmmmm. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Mrs. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Oh... oh! 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Quiz me. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. So... and Andy is gay. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Uuuuh... well. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Well, it wasn't him. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk.  
MICHAEL: Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. What do you know about Meredith? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know. Jan : Michael? Hello? Michael?  
MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job! 
MICHAEL: Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks. 
MICHAEL: Yeah... 
MICHAEL: Yeah... Billy 
MICHAEL: Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three. 
MICHAEL: Yeah... I could. 
MICHAEL: Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say. 
MICHAEL: Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's...  Whup! Come on! Hey! Todd 
MICHAEL: Yeah... ugh. She's...  you don't deserve her. Alright. 
MICHAEL: Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike. 
MICHAEL: Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science. 
MICHAEL: Yeah? 
MICHAEL: Yeah? 
MICHAEL: Yeah? 
MICHAEL: Yeah? 
MICHAEL: Yeah? 
MICHAEL: Yeah?

MICHAEL: Yeah? 
MICHAEL: Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy. 
MICHAEL: Yeah? Who did you have? 
MICHAEL: Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute. 
MICHAEL: Yeah-es. 
MICHAEL: Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to,  Danny Cordray!  Danny couldn't be here tonight... 
MICHAEL: Years! 
MICHAEL: Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather? 
MICHAEL: Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?

MICHAEL: Yep, all right. 
MICHAEL: Yep, get it. 
MICHAEL: Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it. 
MICHAEL: Yep, never been used. 
MICHAEL: Yep, not as good as gold.  Why are you playing the national anthem? 
MICHAEL: Yep, right after you. Apres-vous.  No calls. 
MICHAEL: Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious? 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Yep.   
MICHAEL: Yep. Captain 
MICHAEL: Yep. Don't mess with Colorado. 
MICHAEL: Yep. Oh... wow. 
MICHAEL: Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win. 
MICHAEL: Yep. Yeah, she's up front. 
MICHAEL: Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I'm making him do my laundry for a year. 
MICHAEL: Yeppers. 
MICHAEL: Yes 
MICHAEL: Yes 
MICHAEL: Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye! 
MICHAEL: Yes I am. 
MICHAEL: Yes I do. 
MICHAEL: Yes I do. 
MICHAEL: Yes I do. 
MICHAEL: Yes I do. You've just never seen it.   March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets. 
MICHAEL: Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery. 
MICHAEL: Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday. 
MICHAEL: Yes I was. Yes I was. 
MICHAEL: Yes I would. So, what have you been doing? 
MICHAEL: Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left. 
MICHAEL: Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate. 
MICHAEL: Yes it is! 
MICHAEL: Yes it is! 
MICHAEL: Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it? 
MICHAEL: Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate... 
MICHAEL: Yes it is. 
MICHAEL: Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager. 
MICHAEL: Yes it is. I am writing a book about it. Bar 
MICHAEL: Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you. 
MICHAEL: Yes it was. 
MICHAEL: Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu! 
MICHAEL: Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time.  
MICHAEL: Yes they are, you just don't care about the information. 
MICHAEL: Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music? 
MICHAEL: Yes they were. 
MICHAEL: Yes we do. 
MICHAEL: Yes we do. Larry 
MICHAEL: Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back.   Ah, okay. 
MICHAEL: Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them. 
MICHAEL: Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business!  Hello! 
MICHAEL: Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you. Pizza 
MICHAEL: Yes you are.   
MICHAEL: Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim. 
MICHAEL: Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome. 
MICHAEL: Yes you can. 
MICHAEL: Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this? 
MICHAEL: Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out. 
MICHAEL: Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and... 
MICHAEL: Yes you do. 
MICHAEL: Yes you will. 
MICHAEL: Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group. 
MICHAEL: Yes! 
MICHAEL: Yes! 
MICHAEL: Yes! 
MICHAEL: Yes! 
MICHAEL: Yes! All right, come on down Meredith! 
MICHAEL: Yes! Can you believe it? That's what I'm talking about! 
MICHAEL: Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin! 
MICHAEL: Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil! 
MICHAEL: Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will! 
MICHAEL: Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those. 
MICHAEL: Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby. 
MICHAEL: Yes! Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Yes! You went over my head to Wallace! 
MICHAEL: Yes, about that. 
MICHAEL: Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm...  Delivery 
MICHAEL: Yes, all right. Who else?   Can I put you down for 10 pounds? 
MICHAEL: Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant. 
MICHAEL: Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.   Bill Cosby. 
MICHAEL: Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me. 
MICHAEL: Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio. 
MICHAEL: Yes, and thank you for sending that to me. 
MICHAEL: Yes, Andy. 
MICHAEL: Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that. 
MICHAEL: Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings. 
MICHAEL: Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart... 
MICHAEL: Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy. 
MICHAEL: Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake. 
MICHAEL: Yes, but, Ben Franklin was. Ben 
MICHAEL: Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace. 
MICHAEL: Yes, definitely. 
MICHAEL: Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover. 
MICHAEL: Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes? 
MICHAEL: Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing. 
MICHAEL: Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and... 
MICHAEL: Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Yes, I am, Charles. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I am. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I am. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I am. Are you? 
MICHAEL: Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I do! 
MICHAEL: Yes, I do. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I don't... 
MICHAEL: Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I was watching Jim's face. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I will not be. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I... 
MICHAEL: Yes, I'm bringing Darryl. 
MICHAEL: Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link. 
MICHAEL: Yes, indeed. 
MICHAEL: Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin. 
MICHAEL: Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our... 
MICHAEL: Yes, is Mr. Hudson there? 
MICHAEL: Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go. 
MICHAEL: Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at. 
MICHAEL: Yes, it is. 
MICHAEL: Yes, it was that. It's that one. 
MICHAEL: Yes, it's mine. Police Officer 
MICHAEL: Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill. 
MICHAEL: Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit. 
MICHAEL: Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this. 
MICHAEL: Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later. 
MICHAEL: Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes. 
MICHAEL: Yes, of course. What is this in reference to? 
MICHAEL: Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me. 
MICHAEL: Yes, Phyl? 
MICHAEL: Yes, please. 
MICHAEL: Yes, right in here, come on in. Billy 
MICHAEL: Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys. 
MICHAEL: Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you. 
MICHAEL: Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize. 
MICHAEL: Yes, she is nuts. 
MICHAEL: Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday. 
MICHAEL: Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin! 
MICHAEL: Yes, sir. 
MICHAEL: Yes, sure they do, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Yes, thank you for seeing that. 
MICHAEL: Yes, thank you. 
MICHAEL: Yes, thank you. I know where to sign. 
MICHAEL: Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent. 
MICHAEL: Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work. 
MICHAEL: Yes, that's a good idea. 
MICHAEL: Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right? 
MICHAEL: Yes, that's me. Come on it. 
MICHAEL: Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby! 
MICHAEL: Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute. 
MICHAEL: Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail. 
MICHAEL: Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning. 
MICHAEL: Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else? 
MICHAEL: Yes, Toby? 
MICHAEL: Yes, um, Jim. Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office. 
MICHAEL: Yes, we did. 
MICHAEL: Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle. 
MICHAEL: Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup?   Is this the cup?   Is this what I drink out of?   Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession. 
MICHAEL: Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks. 
MICHAEL: Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman... 
MICHAEL: Yes, what else? 
MICHAEL: Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat. 
MICHAEL: Yes, yes I do. I love that song.   First I was afraid, I was petrified. 
MICHAEL: Yes, yes! Okay! 
MICHAEL: Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture. 
MICHAEL: Yes, yes. 
MICHAEL: Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody... 
MICHAEL: Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy. 
MICHAEL: Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that?  Three hours. We're half way done. 
MICHAEL: Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have? 
MICHAEL: Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch. 
MICHAEL: Yes, you did. 
MICHAEL: Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history. 
MICHAEL: Yes, you did. What is wrong with you? 
MICHAEL: Yes, you have tapped this. Hard. 
MICHAEL: Yes, your corner. Go. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Yes.

MICHAEL: Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So... 
MICHAEL: Yes. And don't call me Shirley. 
MICHAEL: Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.  Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals. 
MICHAEL: Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it! 
MICHAEL: Yes. Count to three, please. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Darryl and 
MICHAEL: Yes. Diane 
MICHAEL: Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Gooooo-tee! 
MICHAEL: Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Homelessness. What? Bar 
MICHAEL: Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome. 
MICHAEL: Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello. 
MICHAEL: Yes. I kind of arranged it. 
MICHAEL: Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.   Yeah, take as many as you want. 
MICHAEL: Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on. 
MICHAEL: Yes. I said that yesterday. 
MICHAEL: Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David. 
MICHAEL: Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Jim... 
MICHAEL: Yes. Join me please, won't you?  I am going to give you a raise. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Mr. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---" 
MICHAEL: Yes. Right. Good. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Second 
MICHAEL: Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse. 
MICHAEL: Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need "small talk." What topics can you use for small talk? 
MICHAEL: Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything. 
MICHAEL: Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Pam says hi.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye. 
MICHAEL: Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers. 
MICHAEL: Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK? 
MICHAEL: Yes. We are. We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide. David 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I? 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes! Oh! There-oh!  
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon. Uncle

MICHAEL: Yesh. 
MICHAEL: Yessh. 
MICHAEL: Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life. 
MICHAEL: Yick. Blood 
MICHAEL: Yo soy Cancun. 
MICHAEL: Yoko shack. Male 
MICHAEL: You all right Ryan? 
MICHAEL: You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin? 
MICHAEL: You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place. 
MICHAEL: You and Jim are close, huh? 
MICHAEL: You and me. 
MICHAEL: You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards! 
MICHAEL: You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas. 
MICHAEL: You and your wife, and you have kids. 
MICHAEL: You are- 
MICHAEL: You are a liar. 
MICHAEL: You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah? 
MICHAEL: You are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand." 
MICHAEL: You are being too modest. 
MICHAEL: You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business. 
MICHAEL: You are doing it. 
MICHAEL: You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk! 
MICHAEL: You are getting so funny!  Very good. 
MICHAEL: You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it. Mr. 
MICHAEL: You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK? 
MICHAEL: You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry? 
MICHAEL: You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop. 
MICHAEL: You are lying right now. 
MICHAEL: You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon. 
MICHAEL: You are not leaving. No! We are not done. 
MICHAEL: You are not reacting at all as I had hoped. 
MICHAEL: You are out of order. 
MICHAEL: You are relieved. 
MICHAEL: You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info. 
MICHAEL: You are so brave. You are so brave. Billy 
MICHAEL: You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me. 
MICHAEL: You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital? 
MICHAEL: You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex. 
MICHAEL: You are welcome. 
MICHAEL: You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop.  You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me. 
MICHAEL: You are. You are. 
MICHAEL: You are? 
MICHAEL: You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard? 
MICHAEL: You are? What bar? 
MICHAEL: You be cool. 
MICHAEL: You bet your fat ass we are. 
MICHAEL: You bet. 
MICHAEL: You broke up with AJ weeks ago. 
MICHAEL: You called Bob? 
MICHAEL: You can call. Can you call 'em? 
MICHAEL: You can do it, just say it. 
MICHAEL: You can do the old way or whatever you think would work.  
MICHAEL: You can do this. You can do this. 
MICHAEL: You can get up. Get up.  And you can hug it out, bitch.  
MICHAEL: You can go to hell.   I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world. 
MICHAEL: You can hear me, but I can't hear you. 
MICHAEL: You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want. 
MICHAEL: You can not, I have a thing tonight. 
MICHAEL: You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you. 
MICHAEL: You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world.   Oh God! Blech! Phyllis! 
MICHAEL: You can toss them. 
MICHAEL: You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um... Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours. 
MICHAEL: You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace. 
MICHAEL: You can. 
MICHAEL: You cannot say "I was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened. 
MICHAEL: You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming. 
MICHAEL: You can't always work 200 days though. 
MICHAEL: You can't be a baby in the office. It makes me look like I hire babies. 
MICHAEL: You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file. 
MICHAEL: You can't have it. 
MICHAEL: You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody. 
MICHAEL: You can't quit! On the first day. That's  heresy, my friend!  Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what? 
MICHAEL: You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win.  Eight points. Nine points.  
MICHAEL: You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to? 
MICHAEL: You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan. 
MICHAEL: You did uh... okay. 
MICHAEL: You did! 
MICHAEL: You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out. 
MICHAEL: You did? 
MICHAEL: You did? 
MICHAEL: You did? 
MICHAEL: You did? 
MICHAEL: You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza? 
MICHAEL: You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going? 
MICHAEL: You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright. 
MICHAEL: You didn't have any of the potato salad did you? 
MICHAEL: You didn't know it was my birthday. 
MICHAEL: You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good. 
MICHAEL: You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager. 
MICHAEL: You do? How do you get in? 
MICHAEL: You don't get it. 
MICHAEL: You don't have all the facts. 
MICHAEL: You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide. 
MICHAEL: You don't have to say it like that. 
MICHAEL: You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all. 
MICHAEL: You don't know that. 
MICHAEL: You don't know what it is.  
MICHAEL: You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit." 
MICHAEL: You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet...  "I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!"  Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it! 
MICHAEL: You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k  No, no! 
MICHAEL: You don't. No, no. 
MICHAEL: You enjoy the second act. 
MICHAEL: You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de- 
MICHAEL: You ever read this?  
MICHAEL: You excited? About the new company? 
MICHAEL: You find it? 
MICHAEL: You first. 
MICHAEL: You forged them! You forged the forms! 
MICHAEL: You get me. 
MICHAEL: You get something good this year? 
MICHAEL: You got it? 
MICHAEL: You got that? 
MICHAEL: You gotta crack these things open. 
MICHAEL: You gotta do something-- 
MICHAEL: You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating. 
MICHAEL: You gotta keep yourself dehydrated. 
MICHAEL: You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand. 
MICHAEL: You guys ever protect the president? 
MICHAEL: You guys excited about the party? 
MICHAEL: You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it. 
MICHAEL: You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday? 
MICHAEL: You guys think Donna's cheating on me? 
MICHAEL: You guys! Yes! Yes! 
MICHAEL: You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true? 
MICHAEL: You have big plans for tonight? 
MICHAEL: You have no idea how high I can fly. 
MICHAEL: You have no idea what you're talking about. 
MICHAEL: You have plans. 
MICHAEL: You have stress? 
MICHAEL: You have to ask me that because you work for human resources. 
MICHAEL: You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did. 
MICHAEL: You have two seconds.   
MICHAEL: You having fun? 
MICHAEL: You heard me, pack your things. 
MICHAEL: You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference. 
MICHAEL: You just said "part of your duties are to" something. 
MICHAEL: You just said, let me uh... check my notes. You just said... 
MICHAEL: You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand. 
MICHAEL: You kind of have. 
MICHAEL: You knew about this all along, didn't you? 
MICHAEL: You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned,  this says 'World's Best Dad'. 
MICHAEL: You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that? 
MICHAEL: You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you. 
MICHAEL: You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do? 
MICHAEL: You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price. 
MICHAEL: You know let me give you some money for this. Prince 
MICHAEL: You know me very well, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.   I'm okay. No, I'm not. 
MICHAEL: You know this can't go on. 
MICHAEL: You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley. 
MICHAEL: You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea. 
MICHAEL: You know what Erin you do have to. 
MICHAEL: You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon. 
MICHAEL: You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this. 
MICHAEL: You know what it means. 
MICHAEL: You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions. 
MICHAEL: You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me. 
MICHAEL: You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and... 
MICHAEL: You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice. 
MICHAEL: You know what the problem is? 
MICHAEL: You know what they say, keep your friends close.   
MICHAEL: You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go. 
MICHAEL: You know what this is? This is a stinger. 
MICHAEL: You know what we need? We need some couches in here. 
MICHAEL: You know what we should do? 
MICHAEL: You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them. 
MICHAEL: You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do? 
MICHAEL: You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "How could they do this to us?" 
MICHAEL: You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no? 
MICHAEL: You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok? 
MICHAEL: You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about. 
MICHAEL: You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something. 
MICHAEL: You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch. 
MICHAEL: You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just... 
MICHAEL: You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator. Co-Worker 
MICHAEL: You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch.  It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies - 
MICHAEL: You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so.. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here.  
MICHAEL: You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla. 
MICHAEL: You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and - 
MICHAEL: You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real 
MICHAEL: You know what, my job will be here when I get back. 
MICHAEL: You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby... 
MICHAEL: You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright. 
MICHAEL: You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps. 
MICHAEL: You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree. 
MICHAEL: You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit. 
MICHAEL: You know what. I had a great time at prom. And no one said 'Yes' to that either. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed? 
MICHAEL: You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Dwight, Dwight... 
MICHAEL: You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Get Pam. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I deserve a bump. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it.  
MICHAEL: You know what? I should. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think? 
MICHAEL: You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I'll help. I will... 
MICHAEL: You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come. Jerome 
MICHAEL: You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys. 
MICHAEL: You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts.  I did do it!  
MICHAEL: You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency. 
MICHAEL: You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal? 
MICHAEL: You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend. 
MICHAEL: You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody. 
MICHAEL: You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race. Mr. 
MICHAEL: You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room. Pizza 
MICHAEL: You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today. 
MICHAEL: You know what? We should really do something fun this week. 
MICHAEL: You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom. 
MICHAEL: You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early? 
MICHAEL: You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends. 
MICHAEL: You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson. 
MICHAEL: You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now. 
MICHAEL: You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room. 
MICHAEL: You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh. 
MICHAEL: You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work? Well, I don't believe that. I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart. It is just elegant. 
MICHAEL: You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him. 
MICHAEL: You know who I really think should go? Stanley. 
MICHAEL: You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom. 
MICHAEL: You know who my favorite character is? The invalid.  I am coming to your party. 
MICHAEL: You know who that is? 
MICHAEL: You know who used to sit at that desk? 
MICHAEL: You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him? 
MICHAEL: You know you did. 
MICHAEL: You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing. 
MICHAEL: You know, David. I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me. 
MICHAEL: You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me? 
MICHAEL: You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me. 
MICHAEL: You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me. 
MICHAEL: You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She... 
MICHAEL: You know, I had never been out of the country before now? 
MICHAEL: You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player? 
MICHAEL: You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big. 
MICHAEL: You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing. Ad guy 
MICHAEL: You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question   for you would be   how many clients do you have? Prince 
MICHAEL: You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you. 
MICHAEL: You know, I would like to try the luge, through. 
MICHAEL: You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break. 
MICHAEL: You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here. 
MICHAEL: You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine. 
MICHAEL: You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it, 
MICHAEL: You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it. 
MICHAEL: You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show. 
MICHAEL: You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here- 
MICHAEL: You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing. 
MICHAEL: You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse. 
MICHAEL: You know. 
MICHAEL: You know? 
MICHAEL: You leaked it? 
MICHAEL: You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop? 
MICHAEL: You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot, 
MICHAEL: You listen to me. You listen good. You are are not, to see that boy, anymore. 
MICHAEL: You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish. 
MICHAEL: You look great too. 
MICHAEL: You look great! And you're a princess? 
MICHAEL: You look great. 
MICHAEL: You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise." You were, like, "What?" "What the hell's goin' on here?" Good cake. Why don't you have some? 
MICHAEL: You love it. There ya go. 
MICHAEL: You mad? You mad at me? 
MICHAEL: You made this? Wow.  That's... that's very nice. 
MICHAEL: You may be asking yourself, "What am I doing on a trampoline?" Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, "Hey! You ever seen a suicide?" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side 
MICHAEL: You may be right. I may be crazy. 
MICHAEL: You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease. 
MICHAEL: You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy! 
MICHAEL: You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow! 
MICHAEL: You mean cancer? 
MICHAEL: You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet. 
MICHAEL: You might take something. 
MICHAEL: You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that. 
MICHAEL: You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend --- 
MICHAEL: You must feel pretty good about yourself right now. 
MICHAEL: You need the big guns, yes? 
MICHAEL: You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar! 
MICHAEL: You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so... 
MICHAEL: You never know about the press. 
MICHAEL: You never said anything. 
MICHAEL: You ok? 
MICHAEL: You put the TV here, you put the family over here. 
MICHAEL: You ready to do this? 
MICHAEL: You ready to give me my discount now? Pizza 
MICHAEL: You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles. 
MICHAEL: You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off. 
MICHAEL: You really screwed that up.  
MICHAEL: You said butt. 
MICHAEL: You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person. 
MICHAEL: You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said. 
MICHAEL: You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So... 
MICHAEL: You saw who did this and you didn't stop them? 
MICHAEL: You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them. 
MICHAEL: You sent him cards? You never met him. 
MICHAEL: You should get out of them. 
MICHAEL: You should give them a call. Check that out. 
MICHAEL: You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic. 
MICHAEL: You should see the other guy. 
MICHAEL: You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy. 
MICHAEL: You should... floss. 
MICHAEL: You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  Ryan, coffee. 
MICHAEL: You should've told me. 
MICHAEL: You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so... 
MICHAEL: You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted. 
MICHAEL: You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been? 
MICHAEL: You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.  And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead. 
MICHAEL: You still don't know. 
MICHAEL: You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!

MICHAEL: You wanna be Santa? 
MICHAEL: You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind.  Look at that. 
MICHAEL: You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.

MICHAEL: You want more?

MICHAEL: You wearing a thong? Ben 
MICHAEL: You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating. 
MICHAEL: You were a Jet? 
MICHAEL: You were lying. 
MICHAEL: You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her. 
MICHAEL: You were surprised, weren't you? 
MICHAEL: You will find love. 
MICHAEL: You will have pancakes and you'll like it. 
MICHAEL: You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me. 
MICHAEL: You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone. 
MICHAEL: You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players.   
MICHAEL: You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first. 
MICHAEL: You would not believe what happened here. 
MICHAEL: You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.

MICHAEL: You, too, Dwight? 
MICHAEL: You, you like that? 
MICHAEL: You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?

MICHAEL: You'll break it. 
MICHAEL: You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these  and call me in the morning. 
MICHAEL: You'll figure it out. 
MICHAEL: You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day. 
MICHAEL: You'll learn, baby. You'll learn. 
MICHAEL: You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. "Too soon for Arabs." Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court. 
MICHAEL: Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger. 
MICHAEL: Your body only has a certain amount. 
MICHAEL: Your dentist's name is Crentist.

MICHAEL: You're acting inappropriate. Jan. 
MICHAEL: You're actually talking a lot. Blood 
MICHAEL: You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly.  No. NO!  
MICHAEL: You're an idiot. 
MICHAEL: You're back. What happened? 
MICHAEL: You're breaking up. 
MICHAEL: You're breaking up. I can't hear you. 
MICHAEL: You're cheating. You're cheating on me. 
MICHAEL: You're close with Pam too. 
MICHAEL: You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here. 
MICHAEL: You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose.   Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it. 
MICHAEL: You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's... 
MICHAEL: You're 'I need you to' is my command. 
MICHAEL: You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn? 
MICHAEL: You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser. 
MICHAEL: You're kidding me. Ahh! 
MICHAEL: You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this? 
MICHAEL: You're kidding. 
MICHAEL: You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this . 
MICHAEL: You're not from paper? 
MICHAEL: You're not going to. You know where you're going? 
MICHAEL: You're not gonna lose them. 
MICHAEL: You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please? 
MICHAEL: You're not prone to seizures? 
MICHAEL: You're not. 
MICHAEL: You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous... 
MICHAEL: You're right, I didn't even think of him. 
MICHAEL: You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok. 
MICHAEL: You're right. 
MICHAEL: You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends. 
MICHAEL: You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  Do you know what this is for? 
MICHAEL: You're right. That's good. 
MICHAEL: You're right. What do you mean though? 
MICHAEL: You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together. 
MICHAEL: You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.  
MICHAEL: You're so lucky! Good one...   
MICHAEL: You're starting, you're kinda losing them. 
MICHAEL: You're sure? 
MICHAEL: You're the bait for Toby? 
MICHAEL: You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping? 
MICHAEL: You're trying to trick me.

MICHAEL: You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here. 
MICHAEL: You're... You're welcome. 
MICHAEL: You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls. 
MICHAEL: You've got it, you've got it. 
MICHAEL: You've got it. 
MICHAEL: Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.

MICHEAL: Yeah, don't think about the stakes. It'll freak you out. 
MICHEL:  Good morning Erin, any mustaches? I mean messages? 
MICHEL: Can you shove down? Instead... shove down, please. Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer. 
MICHEL: I think it sucks. 
MICHEL: Packman. Todd 
MICHEL: Um, yeah. 
MIHAEL: What do you think? 
MIICHAEL: Thank you.

MIKELA: We just want to say thanks. 
MIKELA: You lied to us.

NANA: See, this is what concerns me. Old 
NANA: So let's hear it. 
NANA: This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club! 
NANA: What's your mission statement? 
NARRATOR:  Michael Scarn, well that's an interesting story.  He was once the best secret agent in the business. That was years ago. Where is he now? Well, that's also an interesting story. 
NARRATOR:  Well, Michael Scarn was back in the game. And I bet you're wondering why do I know so much about Michael Scarn.  Well because I AM Michael Scarn.  
NARRATOR:  Well, the All Star Game was three days away, so naturally it was all sold out. The only way Scarn was getting in was in a uniform. Just one problem with that, Scarn didn't know a hockey stick from a Slim Jim. So he went to meet with the famed trainer...  Cherokee Jack. Cherokee 
NARRATOR: But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all. It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war. Amanda: You have to understand. Poets, artists, dancers   these kind of men preferred peace to war. These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms. Amidst the macho brutality of war this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive  and well  fabulous. 
NARRATOR: Families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front. 
NARRATOR: It wasn't easy for Scarn to admit that he had lost his self-confidence. And he hadn't of course, He just wasn't using it right now. 
NARRATOR: Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country. 
NARRATOR: Well, the hostages were scared. 
NATE:  
NATE:   I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day.  Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves. 
NATE:  Employees except 
NATE:  He did it. 
NATE:  Okay. 
NATE:  Ten thousand seven hundred and six. 
NATE:  That's really rude. 
NATE:  Y'ello. 
NATE: Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time.  I, in my, I... 
NATE: Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets. 
NATE: Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited.  Darryl. 
NATE: Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises... 
NATE: Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing. 
NATE: Can I open it? 
NATE: Darryl, you shouldn't have. 
NATE: Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep. 
NATE: Dwight called my house, but he didn t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can t stay out of her stuff. 
NATE: Got it.  
NATE: Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt... 
NATE: He says, "No." 
NATE: Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha... 
NATE: Hola amigo. 
NATE: How long you, does it take usually? Cause... 
NATE: How'd you know? 
NATE: I don't think it goes that way. 
NATE: I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat. 
NATE: I wasn't here.  
NATE: I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use. 
NATE: I will look so handsome for you, Darryl. 
NATE: I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy. 
NATE: Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec. 
NATE: No you're not. 
NATE: No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes.  
NATE: Oh Darryl, hey. 
NATE: Oh, hey Pam. 
NATE: Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three,  two,  one,  zero.  
NATE: One, two, three.  Not everyone jumped. 
NATE: One, two, three.  Still some people not jumping. 
NATE: Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam. 
NATE: Pam. Pam? 
NATE: Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia. 
NATE: Si, yo muy bueno worker. 
NATE: So, she's gonna pull through again?  That's great. Can I talk to her? 
NATE: The building's underground? 
NATE: They're so elegant. 
NATE: Uh, I'm going to say "I" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of "he says blah, blah, blah," I'm going to say "I say, blah, blah, blah," but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, "He remembers Toby."  "I remember Toby." 
NATE: Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'. 
NATE: What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a- 
NATE: What? 
NATE: When you do your makeup, 
NATE: Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you. 
NATE: Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything... 
NATE: Yeah. 
NATE: Yeah. 
NATE: Yes, I'm really good at English. 
NATE: You had me at  clookies.  I can't wait to find out what they are. 
NELLIE:  
NELLIE:  
NELLIE:   She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.  
NELLIE:  A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.  
NELLIE:  Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias. Robert 
NELLIE:  And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute. 
NELLIE:  Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.  
NELLIE:  Come in! 
NELLIE:  Dwight?  Hello? Dwight? 
NELLIE:  Fluke. 
NELLIE:  Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived. 
NELLIE:  I... 
NELLIE:  I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together. 
NELLIE:  In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There s Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.  
NELLIE:  It s funny right?  
NELLIE:  Looking for this? 
NELLIE:  Oh, a movie. What is this? 
NELLIE:  Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight. 
NELLIE:  Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.  
NELLIE:  Oh. 
NELLIE:  Pam! . 
NELLIE:  Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer. Todd 
NELLIE:  See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow? 
NELLIE:  Shh. 
NELLIE:  So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command? 
NELLIE:  This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich. 
NELLIE:  Well, I have considered kidnapping one. 
NELLIE:  What we have ? 
NELLIE:  What, then? 
NELLIE:  What? Nail stylist 
NELLIE:  Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him. 
NELLIE:  Yeeeeahhhh! It's almost unbelievable! 
NELLIE:  You know what this is all about. 
NELLIE:  Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it. 
NELLIE: "Take a man's job, but leave him his balls." Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie. 
NELLIE: $30, yes! 
NELLIE: . How can you be sure? 
NELLIE: ..writing.. 
NELLIE: A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet. 
NELLIE: aagh! 
NELLIE: A-bam!  My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I ve tried so far is Alpine Select! 
NELLIE: Absolutely not! 
NELLIE: Absolutely not. Seven percent. 
NELLIE: Ah ha! 
NELLIE: Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the- 
NELLIE: Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, "Yes!" So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like? 
NELLIE: Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies!  
NELLIE: Ah, what is your topic? 
NELLIE: All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws. 
NELLIE: All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis. 
NELLIE: Allow me to solve your problem, then. 
NELLIE: Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars. 
NELLIE: Alright then. 
NELLIE: Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just  you three, no. 
NELLIE: And a wave crashing  a wave crashing.  
NELLIE: And Filipino. But we ll break that to her later. 
NELLIE: And the answer  is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never.  
NELLIE: And the...agency require a character reference from my employer. 
NELLIE: And then we thought we d   I can t. I just can t carry on with that face. Look at it. I m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh. 
NELLIE: And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over. 
NELLIE: And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we re going to be in so much trouble! 
NELLIE: Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now. 
NELLIE: Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word. 
NELLIE: Andy. 
NELLIE: Andy. 
NELLIE: Andy? 
NELLIE: Angela advances. 
NELLIE: Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars. 
NELLIE: Angela, two hundred dollars! 
NELLIE: Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight. 
NELLIE: Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you! 
NELLIE: Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper? 
NELLIE: Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello?   Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello?  Dwight?  Dwight.  
NELLIE: Are you insulting my guests? 
NELLIE: Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this. 
NELLIE: Blow in my ear. 
NELLIE: Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink. 
NELLIE: Brilliant! 
NELLIE: Brilliant. 
NELLIE: But he s flirting with Jim s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to. Mr. 
NELLIE: But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist. 
NELLIE: By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle. 
NELLIE: Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like? 
NELLIE: Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal? 
NELLIE: Can I see the wound? 
NELLIE: Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here. 
NELLIE: Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo? 
NELLIE: Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you. 
NELLIE: Creed, you are a thousand years old. 
NELLIE: Darryl is  dating  Dunder Mifflin. 
NELLIE: Darryl, looking good! 
NELLIE: Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron? 
NELLIE: Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had? 
NELLIE: Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off. 
NELLIE: Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap. 
NELLIE: Do you think I d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish? 
NELLIE: Do you want to go again? 
NELLIE: Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night? 
NELLIE: Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals. 
NELLIE: Dwight told me about it earlier. 
NELLIE: Dwight, are you all right? 
NELLIE: Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time. 
NELLIE: Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back. 
NELLIE: Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise. 
NELLIE: Dwight, our co-workers  health issues are really none of our business so- 
NELLIE: Dwight, what about you? 
NELLIE: Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad. 
NELLIE: Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise? 
NELLIE: Dwight, you will be participating. 
NELLIE: Dwight. You re the vice president. 
NELLIE: Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes. 
NELLIE: Entrapment if I'm.. 
NELLIE: Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional. 
NELLIE: Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory. 
NELLIE: Everyone would be known for their accomplishments. 
NELLIE: Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount. 
NELLIE: Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies.  Wally 
NELLIE: Ew. That s not good. 
NELLIE: Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to? 
NELLIE: Fine. 
NELLIE: Five... four... 
NELLIE: For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich. Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson . 
NELLIE: For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it! 
NELLIE: Get her out. 
NELLIE: Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money. 
NELLIE: God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician? 
NELLIE: God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant. 
NELLIE: Good night Andy. 
NELLIE: Great, thank you. 
NELLIE: Have you seen Darryl? 
NELLIE: He doesn't even care. 
NELLIE: He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness.  
NELLIE: He is so good, though. 
NELLIE: Here s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others. 
NELLIE: He's doing it. 
NELLIE: Hey Toby. 
NELLIE: Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds. 
NELLIE: Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader? 
NELLIE: Hm? 
NELLIE: Hmm, no. 
NELLIE: Hmm. Yeah. All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam... 
NELLIE: Hmm? Oh oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine. I'm mean, I d I just don't wanna burden you with my massive stress freak outs! 
NELLIE: Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked. 
NELLIE: How are things in the warehouse? 
NELLIE: How are you feeling? 
NELLIE: How did that look? 
NELLIE: How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me? 
NELLIE: How you doing? 
NELLIE: Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual. 
NELLIE: I am in too, Pam. 
NELLIE: I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George. Robert 
NELLIE: I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force. 
NELLIE: I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way. 
NELLIE: I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night. 
NELLIE: I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more. 
NELLIE: I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one? 
NELLIE: I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong. 
NELLIE: I didn t really think about it like that. 
NELLIE: I don't need anyone to- 
NELLIE: I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt. 
NELLIE: I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense. 
NELLIE: I got your voicemail. From   from last night. 
NELLIE: I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random. 
NELLIE: I have one simple philosophy in 
NELLIE: I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me? Business 
NELLIE: I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either. 
NELLIE: I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no. 
NELLIE: I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood. 
NELLIE: I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered. 
NELLIE: I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones? 
NELLIE: I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars!  Five... four... 
NELLIE: I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity. 
NELLIE: I m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let s-- let s use an example. Take Erin. Erin s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean. 
NELLIE: I m sexy Toby. 
NELLIE: I m very self-conscious about my feet. 
NELLIE: I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex. 
NELLIE: I say we all have one last fun boss-less day. 
NELLIE: I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry. 
NELLIE: I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah. 
NELLIE: I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands. 
NELLIE: I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say 
NELLIE: I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples. 
NELLIE: I wasn t really sure which one of you is Chuck. 
NELLIE: I will be right back. 
NELLIE: I will see you in seven- 
NELLIE: I will. 
NELLIE: I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up. 
NELLIE: If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We ll be somewhere in Europe.  Won t we? 
NELLIE: If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm? 
NELLIE: I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic? 
NELLIE: I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars. 
NELLIE: I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you? 
NELLIE: I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who? 
NELLIE: I'm Tinkerbell. 
NELLIE: I'm trying to adopt a baby. 
NELLIE: Impressive. 
NELLIE: In that case, you...  will have to chop off my hand. 
NELLIE: Is it gonna be long? 
NELLIE: Is It? 
NELLIE: Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me.  Emergency 
NELLIE: It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest. 
NELLIE: It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath. 
NELLIE: It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it? 
NELLIE: It is time for a little T & A. I give 
NELLIE: It s just that I am taking my driver s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to  Demandy .... I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But in who's car? 
NELLIE: It s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I m not ashamed of that, But I m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong. 
NELLIE: It sounds amazing, tell us all about it. 
NELLIE: It's not..it's- 
NELLIE: It's not..it's not 
NELLIE: It's the apology. I really have to insist. 
NELLIE: I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes! 
NELLIE: Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him. 
NELLIE: Jim, could you give us a hand? 
NELLIE: Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell? 
NELLIE: Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man.  You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon. 
NELLIE: Jim, time for your review. 
NELLIE: Kevin, did you make that yourself? 
NELLIE: Let me just get the projector working. 
NELLIE: Let's get Darryl Val. Julius 
NELLIE: Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic? 
NELLIE: Let's go again. Five... four... 
NELLIE: Like I'm on the beach.  
NELLIE: Like you. 
NELLIE: Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..? 
NELLIE: Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most. 
NELLIE: Loyalty is exactly right. 
NELLIE: Marriage counseling? 
NELLIE: May I say one thing? 
NELLIE: Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise. 
NELLIE: Mm. 
NELLIE: Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he s a good man and that I hope he feels better. 
NELLIE: Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back,  looking for dirt.  
NELLIE: Mm-hm. 
NELLIE: Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises. 
NELLIE: mm-hmm  
NELLIE: Mm-hmm. 
NELLIE: Mm-hmm. 
NELLIE: Mmm! Uhh  Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph! 
NELLIE: Mmm. 
NELLIE: Mmm.  
NELLIE: Mmm.  Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie? 
NELLIE: Mmmm the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I m driving, so, I might as well get good at it. 
NELLIE: Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You re welcome, Andy. And you re welcome, my own ass. 
NELLIE: My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra.  
NELLIE: My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma.  I just made a joke there. 
NELLIE: My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more  I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone. 
NELLIE: Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking a mural. 
NELLIE: Next up we have Dwight and Phyllis. Bob Vance, Vance 
NELLIE: Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse! 
NELLIE: No no no no. 
NELLIE: No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg!  I love it. 
NELLIE: No, I m sorry but that is true. 
NELLIE: No, let s-- let s-- let s not say Creed. Let s say Mr. X. 
NELLIE: No, no, no, not numbers, no. 
NELLIE: No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic. 
NELLIE: No, you don't understand- 
NELLIE: No. 
NELLIE: No. 
NELLIE: No. 
NELLIE: No. 
NELLIE: No. 
NELLIE: No. 
NELLIE: No. 
NELLIE: No. And I thought I unfriended you. 
NELLIE: No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder? 
NELLIE: No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you? 
NELLIE: No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes. 
NELLIE: No...more...talking. 
NELLIE: Nope. 
NELLIE: Not necessarily 
NELLIE: Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business. 
NELLIE: Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey. 
NELLIE: Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and  full-ass  it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm? 
NELLIE: Oh come on, Andy! 
NELLIE: Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too. 
NELLIE: Oh God. 
NELLIE: Oh man. 
NELLIE: Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping? 
NELLIE: Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair! 
NELLIE: Oh no. 
NELLIE: Oh of course, you were adopted. 
NELLIE: Oh please.  
NELLIE: Oh thank you so much! 
NELLIE: Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget. 
NELLIE: Oh yes. 
NELLIE: Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper. 
NELLIE: Oh! 
NELLIE: Oh! 
NELLIE: oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless! 
NELLIE: Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed. 
NELLIE: Oh! Which public figure? 
NELLIE: Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP. Robert 
NELLIE: Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful 
NELLIE: Oh, come on! 
NELLIE: Oh, come on. We could use a blank card. 
NELLIE: Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don t you just have some more coffee? 
NELLIE: Oh, get out, skeleton man! 
NELLIE: Oh, god, Pam. Don t get me started. 
NELLIE: Oh, good lord. 
NELLIE: Oh, gosh. 
NELLIE: Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos! 
NELLIE: Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze. 
NELLIE: Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it. 
NELLIE: Oh, I don t know. Okay. 
NELLIE: Oh, I don't care. 
NELLIE: Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone. 
NELLIE: Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends. 
NELLIE: Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute.  Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine. 
NELLIE: Oh, is it? 
NELLIE: Oh, it s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are. 
NELLIE: Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there. 
NELLIE: Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove. 
NELLIE: Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace. 
NELLIE: Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it. 
NELLIE: Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man.  Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.  I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie. 
NELLIE: Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic. 
NELLIE: Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright.  It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you. 
NELLIE: Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men. Robert & 
NELLIE: Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  Nellie and 
NELLIE: Oh, please don't use the hourglass. 
NELLIE: Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work. 
NELLIE: Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet. 
NELLIE: Oh, thank you. I don t know, I sort of thought-- 
NELLIE: Oh, that is lovely. 
NELLIE: Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other. 
NELLIE: Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it. 
NELLIE: Oh, well good for you. I mean, you ll need a prescription. 
NELLIE: Oh, why, is there something? 
NELLIE: Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive. 
NELLIE: Oh, yes, yes I see that! Perfect. 
NELLIE: Oh, you signed it? 
NELLIE: Oh, your mom s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to?  Oh, um, Embassy Suites.  Do Not Disturb  sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor. 
NELLIE: Oh. 
NELLIE: Oh. 
NELLIE: Oh. 
NELLIE: Oh. Oh, I ll tell you what he does. 
NELLIE: Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight. 
NELLIE: Oh. Robert 
NELLIE: Oh... Stanley? 
NELLIE: Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this. 
NELLIE: OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela. 
NELLIE: Ok, that's enough. This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one. 
NELLIE: Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room. 
NELLIE: Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started. 
NELLIE: Okay, just calm down. 
NELLIE: Okay, look Dwight, let s just call this thing off. I mean, it s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety. 
NELLIE: Okay.  
NELLIE: On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me. 
NELLIE: Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would  
NELLIE: Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit. 
NELLIE: Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them.  At least once a month, the lowest performing person...  bye bye! 
NELLIE: Oooohh... you salty dog. 
NELLIE: Or what's her name. 
NELLIE: Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer. 
NELLIE: Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding. 
NELLIE: Pam, what is your address? I m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don t   
NELLIE: Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like. 
NELLIE: Performance reviews. 
NELLIE: Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler. 
NELLIE: Psst. Say, "I can't wait to meet him." 
NELLIE: Psst. Say, "So who's leading this thing, anyway?" 
NELLIE: Put your forehead near mine, and see if you can read my thoughts. 
NELLIE: Quite enormous. 
NELLIE: Robert. 
NELLIE: She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell? 
NELLIE: Shh. 
NELLIE: Shh.  
NELLIE: So far, so good. 
NELLIE: So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example? 
NELLIE: So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other.  But why, m'lady?  Because I am your new manager. 
NELLIE: So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it. 
NELLIE: So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it?  Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady?  I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo? 
NELLIE: So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you? 
NELLIE: So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative? 
NELLIE: So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want. 
NELLIE: So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you. 
NELLIE: Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go.  
NELLIE: Something wrong Dwight? 
NELLIE: Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness. 
NELLIE: Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want. 
NELLIE: Stop saying no. 
NELLIE: Stupid like you. 
NELLIE: Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title. 
NELLIE: Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I m this patrician goddess. But here s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32,  I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than   what s lower than dirt? 
NELLIE: Thank you, Andy. 
NELLIE: Thank you. I m  so stupid. 
NELLIE: Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this. 
NELLIE: That is absolutely revolting! 
NELLIE: That is amazing. Todd, look at that. 
NELLIE: That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work. 
NELLIE: That is for sure. 
NELLIE: That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it? 
NELLIE: That one looks empty. 
NELLIE: That s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo! 
NELLIE: That s.... 
NELLIE: That was exhausting. 
NELLIE: That's not even a thing. 
NELLIE: That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two. 
NELLIE: The black one. I never stood a chance. 
NELLIE: The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time? 
NELLIE: The first 'sorry' sounded sincere. 
NELLIE: The mind is part of the body. 
NELLIE: The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral. 
NELLIE: The pill is mine. 
NELLIE: The quality of mercy is not strained. 
NELLIE: The real Mose. 
NELLIE: The warehouse isn't downstairs?  Is it? Is it? 
NELLIE: The way he just cuts off his arm. 
NELLIE: Then you accept it? 
NELLIE: There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley? 
NELLIE: They re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks. 
NELLIE: Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And  I have a new friend. A friend. At work. 
NELLIE: This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com 
NELLIE: This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend. 
NELLIE: This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem. 
NELLIE: Three... 
NELLIE: Three... two... one... 
NELLIE: Today, I launch my big charity initiative  Operation Give Back . Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I d like to see him piss on that one. 
NELLIE: Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me. 
NELLIE: Too weird. 
NELLIE: Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo. 
NELLIE: Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship. 
NELLIE: Two...  one. 
NELLIE: Ugh! I hate that! No offense. 
NELLIE: Uh  that is excellent. Todd 
NELLIE: Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court.  
NELLIE: Uh, excuse me.  I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons? 
NELLIE: Um, is this a good time? 
NELLIE: Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will  who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves. 
NELLIE: Um. 
NELLIE: Very good point. 
NELLIE: Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight. 
NELLIE: Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous. 
NELLIE: We are now down to an elite eight. Well, seven and Toby. 
NELLIE: We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm?  Hello. Hi sweetie. It s Jim. I m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.  
NELLIE: We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm? 
NELLIE: We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill , others relied on showmanship  others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is.  And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster. 
NELLIE: Well done, you two. 
NELLIE: Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback.  Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP. 
NELLIE: Well then if I could just convince... 
NELLIE: Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple. 
NELLIE: Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one. 
NELLIE: Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick  
NELLIE: Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes. 
NELLIE: Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time. 
NELLIE: Well, I don't want any soup. 
NELLIE: Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see? 
NELLIE: Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how. 
NELLIE: Well, it doesn't make you stupid. 
NELLIE: Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama! 
NELLIE: Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it. 
NELLIE: well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal?  One week?  Ok, two weeks?  Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave. 
NELLIE: Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes? 
NELLIE: Well, they deserve each other, then. 
NELLIE: Well, this is getting us nowhere. 
NELLIE: Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive. 
NELLIE: Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking color schemes and the major themes we want to hit. Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper. But not in a child labor-y way. 
NELLIE: Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up! 
NELLIE: Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here? Kevin & 
NELLIE: Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately. 
NELLIE: Were they angry? 
NELLIE: What are the three pillars of retail? 
NELLIE: What did I just say? What did I just say? 
NELLIE: What do you mean? 
NELLIE: What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now! 
NELLIE: What is the delay here? Where s Ryan? Why is he not here? 
NELLIE: What should we say about Jim? 
NELLIE: What? 
NELLIE: What? 
NELLIE: Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul. Robert 
NELLIE: When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan. 
NELLIE: Whhooooo! 
NELLIE: Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy. 
NELLIE: Whoo! 
NELLIE: Whoo! 
NELLIE: Whoo! 
NELLIE: Why are you sitting down like that? 
NELLIE: Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise? 
NELLIE: Why don't you clean the carpets for today? 
NELLIE: Why thank you. 
NELLIE: Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children. 
NELLIE: Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office?  
NELLIE: With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports. 
NELLIE: Wonderful, thanks. 
NELLIE: Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you  have a lot to offer. 
NELLIE: Wow. 
NELLIE: Yeah 
NELLIE: Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault. 
NELLIE: Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn t even get a callback. 
NELLIE: Yeah, you re right. This man needs to be apprehended. 
NELLIE: Yeah. 
NELLIE: Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake! 
NELLIE: Yeah. I... 
NELLIE: Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet. 
NELLIE: Yes! 
NELLIE: Yes! 
NELLIE: Yes! You! You are soo talented! It s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall. 
NELLIE: Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal. 
NELLIE: Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20? 
NELLIE: Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored. 
NELLIE: Yes, Robert! 
NELLIE: Yes. 
NELLIE: Yes.   
NELLIE: Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships? 
NELLIE: Yes. I thought I d you know, be you. 
NELLIE: Yes. It is. Oh yes it is. 
NELLIE: Yes? 
NELLIE: Yes? 
NELLIE: You are gonna bloody ruin it. You re gonna bloody ruin it because you re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed... 
NELLIE: You are most welcome. 
NELLIE: You don't need to- 
NELLIE: You have to choose one now. 
NELLIE: You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning. 
NELLIE: You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit. 
NELLIE: You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap? 
NELLIE: You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here,  and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis.  I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch.  After you decided I wasn't "a good fit-" 
NELLIE: You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here. 
NELLIE: You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together. 
NELLIE: You ve just got me started. Robert  is  a filthy beast. I mean, don t you get the feeling, he s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you? 
NELLIE: You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So. 
NELLIE: You. 
NELLIE: You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam? 
NELLIE: You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably. 
NELLIE: You're the stupid one. 
NELLIE: You're the stupid one. 
NELLIE: You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is. 
NELLIE: You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee! 
NELLIE: Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.

NICK: Yeah.  I already got to yours, Kevin.  
NICK: You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already?

NURSE: Oh good, because my next question was "do you have a game to get back to." 
NURSE: Oh, good. You know everything. 
NURSE: Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant... 
NURSE: Okay, great. 
NURSE: She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot. 
NURSE: Somebody buzzed? 
NURSE: That bottom part needs to go in the car. 
NURSE: To be safe, we should do an x-ray. 
NURSE: Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat? 
NURSE: Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay? 
NURSE: Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later. 
NURSE: What, what are you doing? Just gimme that. 
NURSE: Who are you? 
NURSE: Why don't you get more ice chips? 
NURSE: Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?

OSCAR: Absolutely.

OSCAR: Actually I m the electoral college. Senator 
OSCAR: Actually it is the northernmost. 
OSCAR: Actually, it s pronounced  espresso  Wait. That s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So  
OSCAR: Actually, it's just- 
OSCAR: Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive. 
OSCAR: Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money. 
OSCAR: Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now. 
OSCAR: Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.

OSCAR: Ah, I'll just... wait for him. 
OSCAR: Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips. 
OSCAR: Ah... 
OSCAR: Ahhh!  
OSCAR: All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke. 
OSCAR: All I need is another gym. As if I don t have enough drama. 
OSCAR: All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my... 
OSCAR: All right, Meredith. 
OSCAR: All right. 
OSCAR: All right. 
OSCAR: All right. I can do that. Then what? 
OSCAR: All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden... 
OSCAR: Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday. 
OSCAR: Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis... 
OSCAR: Alright. 
OSCAR: Alright. Alright I get it. 
OSCAR: Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch. 
OSCAR: Am I the first gay man you ever knew? 
OSCAR: And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out. 
OSCAR: And George, his- his youthfulness. His, um, freedom.  Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um... What are you microwaving!? 
OSCAR: And get you the hell outta that place. 
OSCAR: And just like that. As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone.   
OSCAR: And one for good measure!  
OSCAR: And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand. 
OSCAR: And you guys thought this was a good idea? 
OSCAR: And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States. 
OSCAR: Andy bought lunch. 
OSCAR: Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today. 
OSCAR: Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her? 
OSCAR: Andy, no- 
OSCAR: Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper- 
OSCAR: Andy, something is wrong with that woman. 
OSCAR: Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying. 
OSCAR: Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions. 
OSCAR: Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children. 
OSCAR: Andy. 
OSCAR: Andy.  
OSCAR: Andy. That is her private property. 
OSCAR: Angela got pregnant before the wedding. 
OSCAR: Angela s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it s Angela who s living in the closet. Hey-o. 
OSCAR: Angela! 
OSCAR: Angela!  Angela. There. 
OSCAR: Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy! 
OSCAR: Angela, Blake s also a guy s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake? 
OSCAR: Angela, I ll go with you. 
OSCAR: Angela, it s a lead freaking pipe. 
OSCAR: Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up. 
OSCAR: Angela, someone wants you. 
OSCAR: Angela, until you face that, you re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me. 
OSCAR: Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you? 
OSCAR: Angela, you just were  
OSCAR: Angela, you look amazing. 
OSCAR: Angela, you still have your son. 
OSCAR: Angela, you're more chipper than usual. 
OSCAR: Angela. 
OSCAR: Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings,  I'm a little excited.  But overall, horrified. 
OSCAR: Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today.  Me. 
OSCAR: Annex. It must open something in the annex. 
OSCAR: Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse! 
OSCAR: Are you attracted to other men? 
OSCAR: Are you going to tell Michael? 
OSCAR: Are you guys listening to this? 
OSCAR: Are you kidding me? 
OSCAR: Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage. 
OSCAR: Are you kidding? I thought it was you. 
OSCAR: Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up. 
OSCAR: Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot. 
OSCAR: Are you serious? Ugh. Where?   Where?   Where, Dwight? 
OSCAR: Are you?  
OSCAR: Argh! 
OSCAR: As you can see, we did pretty well, so... 
OSCAR: At least he is in the building. 
OSCAR: At least. 
OSCAR: Aw. 
OSCAR: Bankruptcy? 
OSCAR: Because I'm gay? 
OSCAR: Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character. 
OSCAR: Because we're looking up jail time. 
OSCAR: Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away. 
OSCAR: Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me. 
OSCAR: Brava! 
OSCAR: Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness. 
OSCAR: Bulk or definition? 
OSCAR: But I banked six weeks. 
OSCAR: But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget. 
OSCAR: But you just! 
OSCAR: But your mouth is ble  
OSCAR: C est la vie. 
OSCAR: Can I say...? 
OSCAR: Can someone please help me? 
OSCAR: Can we see that? Did you really find it? 
OSCAR: Can you believe this? 
OSCAR: Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall.  Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple. 
OSCAR: Can you breathe okay? 
OSCAR: Can you do this, Kevin? 
OSCAR: Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside? 
OSCAR: Can't you just tell us. 
OSCAR: Chicken marsala. 
OSCAR: Come on buddy, get back. 
OSCAR: Come on Michael. You can... 
OSCAR: Come on Phyllis, you can do it.  Ahh... 
OSCAR: Come on Toby. 
OSCAR: Come on, we'll all go. 
OSCAR: Come stay with me. 
OSCAR: Como estas, senor? 
OSCAR: Congratulations. That's great. (Pam's mom) 
OSCAR: Could you turn the volume down on the beeping? 
OSCAR: Creed? 
OSCAR: Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree. 
OSCAR: Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the... 
OSCAR: David Wallace hasn't worked here in years. 
OSCAR: Definitely no. 
OSCAR: Did we ever have lunch together, just just the two of us? You know what, I m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino s. 
OSCAR: Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks? 
OSCAR: Didn't we? I think we did. 
OSCAR: Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree. 
OSCAR: Do it! It's a--- Call her!   Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy.   Andy, don't call her! 
OSCAR: Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research, financials? 
OSCAR: Do you have specifics? 
OSCAR: Do you know how to do an intervention? 
OSCAR: Do you know? 
OSCAR: Do you not own a mirror? 
OSCAR: Do you really think he's qualified for that job? 
OSCAR: Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you? 
OSCAR: Do you risk telling him how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself? 
OSCAR: Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is? 
OSCAR: Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or... 
OSCAR: Donate to the charity? 
OSCAR: Done! 
OSCAR: Don't do this.   
OSCAR: Don't worry about the coffee, its on me. 
OSCAR: Don't you mean 'Koi Story'? 
OSCAR: Don't you want to see the baby? 
OSCAR: Dumpster Man. 
OSCAR: Dunder Mifflin paper. 
OSCAR: Dwight   this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him. 
OSCAR: Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine. 
OSCAR: Dwight has a sister? 
OSCAR: Dwight please! 
OSCAR: Dwight! 
OSCAR: Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is. 
OSCAR: Dwight, what are you telling this girl? 
OSCAR: Dwight. 
OSCAR: Dwight. Hey. 
OSCAR: Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked. 
OSCAR: Easy. 
OSCAR: Eh. 
OSCAR: El telefono. 
OSCAR: Elliot! 
OSCAR: Erin- 
OSCAR: Erin, what are you doing? 
OSCAR: Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets. 
OSCAR: Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby. 
OSCAR: Everybody shut up and work! 
OSCAR: Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right? 
OSCAR: Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don t we move the copier into the annex like we ve always wanted to? 
OSCAR: Everything OK?  
OSCAR: Exactly! 
OSCAR: Exactly, Andy. 
OSCAR: Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long. 
OSCAR: Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with. 
OSCAR: Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down? 
OSCAR: Fine. 
OSCAR: Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no. 
OSCAR: Five years? 
OSCAR: Flip it back please. 
OSCAR: For me. 
OSCAR: For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia. 
OSCAR: Forty-two. 
OSCAR: From you. I m sure it s probably nothing. But what s with the yoga already? 
OSCAR: Funny Jim. That is funny. 
OSCAR: Go ahead. 
OSCAR: Go on. Kiss each other already.  
OSCAR: Go to the recorded version. 
OSCAR: Good God! 
OSCAR: Good job Andy. 
OSCAR: Good luck! 
OSCAR: Good luck, you guys!  
OSCAR: Good luck. 
OSCAR: Good morning, Michael.   Are you ready for the meeting? 
OSCAR: Good morning.  
OSCAR: Good night Andy. 
OSCAR: Good night, Kevin. 
OSCAR: Good. 
OSCAR: Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error! 
OSCAR: Great, they stole my laptop. 
OSCAR: Great. 
OSCAR: Great. 
OSCAR: Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy? 
OSCAR: Guess we found Andy's rosebud. 
OSCAR: Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time. 
OSCAR: Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes. 
OSCAR: Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just.. 
OSCAR: Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks. 
OSCAR: He did it himself. 
OSCAR: He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes. 
OSCAR: He just won t go down. It s as if he s excited by all this paper. 
OSCAR: He knew! 
OSCAR: He literally won't come out of his office. 
OSCAR: He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time. I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage. 
OSCAR: He messed yours up to. 
OSCAR: He put me here. 
OSCAR: He s fine. 
OSCAR: He s making a phone call. 
OSCAR: He s making a statement. It s an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin. 
OSCAR: He said he wanted me there for support. 
OSCAR: He told me he wasn't gay.   
OSCAR: He went to the car or something, but he'll be back. 
OSCAR: He'll call. 
OSCAR: Hello. 
OSCAR: Hello? 
OSCAR: Here are our final actual costs for this year. 
OSCAR: Here, use my pen. 
OSCAR: Here. 
OSCAR: Here's a question nobody's 
OSCAR: he's a historian. 
OSCAR: He's not even good at his first one. 
OSCAR: He's on one of his honeymoons. 
OSCAR: He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing. 
OSCAR: Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob? 
OSCAR: Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark. 
OSCAR: Hey guys. I m an Oscar  liar  weiner. 
OSCAR: Hey Michael. 
OSCAR: Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet? 
OSCAR: Hey, Dwight. Michael and 
OSCAR: Hey, everyone. 
OSCAR: Hey, Hey Robert! 
OSCAR: Hey, I didn t get a chance to say it, but  congratulations, Dwight. 
OSCAR: Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay. 
OSCAR: Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen. 
OSCAR: Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City. 
OSCAR: Hey, Jim. 
OSCAR: Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy? 
OSCAR: Hey, look who s back, Dwight Junior. 
OSCAR: Hey, Michael. 
OSCAR: Hey, nice office. 
OSCAR: Hey, no. 
OSCAR: Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship.  
OSCAR: Hey, Rockefeller Center! 
OSCAR: Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up. 
OSCAR: Hey, we're going with the chairs. 
OSCAR: Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers? 
OSCAR: Hey, you came in second. Not bad either. 
OSCAR: Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do. 
OSCAR: Hey. 
OSCAR: Hey. 
OSCAR: Hey. 
OSCAR: Hey. 
OSCAR: Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple. 
OSCAR: Hey. Matt, right? 
OSCAR: Hi honey! 
OSCAR: Hi, buddy. 
OSCAR: Hi. 
OSCAR: Him? Him? 
OSCAR: Hold on, hold on, what's going on? 
OSCAR: Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart? 
OSCAR: Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies? 
OSCAR: Honestly, I can return this for a larger size. 
OSCAR: Hoop it up, right. 
OSCAR: How 'bout, she takes it down? 
OSCAR: How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now! 
OSCAR: How can we not watch this? 
OSCAR: How can you live with yourself? 
OSCAR: How could anyone stand that woman? 
OSCAR: How do you even know they're gay? 
OSCAR: How does it end? 
OSCAR: How does that even compare? 
OSCAR: How long do you take to pee? 
OSCAR: How long do you think a week is? 
OSCAR: How many bottles? Three hundred? 
OSCAR: How mean are we talking about? 
OSCAR: How old is she? 
OSCAR: How was Friday night? 
OSCAR: How would anyone even know-- 
OSCAR: How? He can't hit back. 
OSCAR: Huh... 
OSCAR: Huh? 
OSCAR: Huh? 
OSCAR: I-  
OSCAR: I always come in at 7. Warehouse 
OSCAR: I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing. 
OSCAR: I am dying to know what's in there. 
OSCAR: I am livid, Absolutely livid. 
OSCAR: I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding. 
OSCAR: I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer. 
OSCAR: I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous. 
OSCAR: I brought you a cookie. 
OSCAR: I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce. 
OSCAR: I can help out, if you need me. 
OSCAR: I can t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe. 
OSCAR: I can t say we didn t see it coming. But it s a sad day when anybody is fired. We re so sorry, Andy. David 
OSCAR: I cannot believe how condescending Andy's being. 
OSCAR: I can't believe this is really happening. 
OSCAR: I can't believe we called her up.   
OSCAR: I can't. 
OSCAR: I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry. 
OSCAR: I couldn't understand a word he said. 
OSCAR: I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points. 
OSCAR: I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won t be long. It s the least I could do. 
OSCAR: I don t know what you re talking about. 
OSCAR: I don t know, Angela. I m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go. 
OSCAR: I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy? 
OSCAR: I don't even wanna know these things! 
OSCAR: I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important. 
OSCAR: I don't know how to make that. 
OSCAR: I don't know what that means. Hey, hey- 
OSCAR: I don't know what you're talking about. 
OSCAR: I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want...  There he is. 
OSCAR: I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things. 
OSCAR: I don't know. 
OSCAR: I don't know. 
OSCAR: I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the... 
OSCAR: I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost... 
OSCAR: I don't think he meant, that-- 
OSCAR: I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life. 
OSCAR: I don't think so. 
OSCAR: I don't think so. 
OSCAR: I don't think so. 
OSCAR: I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back. 
OSCAR: I don't wear a Speedo, Michael. 
OSCAR: I expect you to apologize for that, Angela. 
OSCAR: I feel nauseous and my heads killing. 
OSCAR: I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands. 
OSCAR: I forgive you for kissing me! 
OSCAR: I found the article.  "On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's. It is rumored that they will recommend... " and the article cuts off. 
OSCAR: I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care. 
OSCAR: I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch. 
OSCAR: I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain. 
OSCAR: I got it. 
OSCAR: I guess so. 
OSCAR: I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer. 
OSCAR: I had a good time too. 
OSCAR: I have a question. 
OSCAR: I have a very strong suspicion. 
OSCAR: I have been very honest with you guys. In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine. You're not going to use any of that, are you? 
OSCAR: I have no idea. 
OSCAR: I have the chills. 
OSCAR: I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control. 
OSCAR: I hope that's it, Kevin. 
OSCAR: I jus... I just need a signature. 
OSCAR: I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all. 
OSCAR: I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors. 
OSCAR: I just never heard about the senator and yoga... 
OSCAR: I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity. 
OSCAR: I just told them to do it! 
OSCAR: I knew that, I knew it. 
OSCAR: I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair. I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. ...Why? 
OSCAR: I know! 
OSCAR: I know. 
OSCAR: I know. 
OSCAR: I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You you can t  
OSCAR: I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela s husband spoon me back to bed. 
OSCAR: I ll come by after work and pick him up. 
OSCAR: I ll watch it. Let s get this over with. 
OSCAR: I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I will have one of own someday.   But I dream... so... 
OSCAR: I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning. 
OSCAR: I m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person? 
OSCAR: I m so sorry. Angela-- 
OSCAR: I made a mistake. I'm sorry. 
OSCAR: I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one?   
OSCAR: I present to you the  rational consumer, as it were. 
OSCAR: I promised I wouldn't tell. 
OSCAR: I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party. 
OSCAR: I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy. 
OSCAR: I should step into sales myself. 
OSCAR: I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me! 
OSCAR: I think it should be Darryl. 
OSCAR: I think of him as more like... a monster? What about, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!" 
OSCAR: I think that's it! 
OSCAR: I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here. 
OSCAR: I think there s, like, $7 left. 
OSCAR: I think this has gone very well and I thank you. 
OSCAR: I think we can do it. 
OSCAR: I think you don't know what you're saying. 
OSCAR: I think you know. 
OSCAR: I thought you were already engaged. 
OSCAR: I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball. 
OSCAR: I want to know. 
OSCAR: I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay. 
OSCAR: I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively. 
OSCAR: I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear. 
OSCAR: I was stupid, I told him. 
OSCAR: I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China. 
OSCAR: I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith. 
OSCAR: I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online. 
OSCAR: I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls. 
OSCAR: I would rather not. 
OSCAR: I, uh, huh, just  Senator 
OSCAR: I'd like to know. You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her. 
OSCAR: I'd love to talk more about it. 
OSCAR: If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see. 
OSCAR: If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret? 
OSCAR: If you don't mind me asking--- 
OSCAR: If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you? 
OSCAR: If you want her to leave, just tip her. 
OSCAR: I'll check us in. 
OSCAR: I'll get him water. 
OSCAR: I'll just be sleep---  
OSCAR: I'll just leave it here with you.  
OSCAR: I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms? 
OSCAR: I'll make it. What are you drinking. 
OSCAR: I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata. 
OSCAR: I'll take the ... teapot. 
OSCAR: I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright  Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy? 
OSCAR: I'm done! 
OSCAR: I'm gay! 
OSCAR: I'm good. 
OSCAR: I'm in big trouble. 
OSCAR: I'm in. 
OSCAR: I'm in. 
OSCAR: I'm just curious. 
OSCAR: I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with? 
OSCAR: I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia. 
OSCAR: I'm messing with you, Holly. 
OSCAR: I'm not done yet. 
OSCAR: I'm on a call. 
OSCAR: I'm on the phone. 
OSCAR: I'm probably going to leave after one drink. 
OSCAR: I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite. 
OSCAR: I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session... 
OSCAR: I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out. 
OSCAR: I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change. 
OSCAR: I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense. 
OSCAR: I'm sure everything will be fine.  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking? 
OSCAR: I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night. 
OSCAR: In any case, it gets better.  Maybe- maybe not much better... but better. 
OSCAR: In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee? 
OSCAR: In this case yes. 
OSCAR: Irony is such a critical... 
OSCAR: Is everything okay? 
OSCAR: Is it that obvious?  No- hey... 
OSCAR: Is Matt around? I got his check. 
OSCAR: Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue?   
OSCAR: Is that a volunteer program or  
OSCAR: Is that Chet Montgomery? 
OSCAR: Is that true, Toby? 
OSCAR: Is there a front runner? 
OSCAR: Is this like a blooper reel? 
OSCAR: Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you? 
OSCAR: It could be snacks, or- 
OSCAR: It just feels like a slap in the face. 
OSCAR: It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves. 
OSCAR: It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play "moo"? 
OSCAR: It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. 
OSCAR: It s a thing. It means  you only live once . 
OSCAR: It s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too! 
OSCAR: It s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I ll just go downstairs. 
OSCAR: It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago. 
OSCAR: It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, "However many dollars per mile." 
OSCAR: It stands for electromagnetic field. Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area  Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight. 
OSCAR: It starts on it's own. Let it - 
OSCAR: It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell. 
OSCAR: It was an amateur production, technically. 
OSCAR: It was crazy. 
OSCAR: It was fine. 
OSCAR: It was insane! 
OSCAR: It wasn't me. 
OSCAR: It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering. 
OSCAR: It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are. 
OSCAR: It's a scoreboard. 
OSCAR: It's clearly not an accounting mistake. 
OSCAR: It's going to be okay. 
OSCAR: It's gonna hurt. 
OSCAR: It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it. 
OSCAR: It's her first try. 
OSCAR: It's just not prudent Michael. 
OSCAR: Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time. 
OSCAR: It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael. 
OSCAR: It's like a pay decrease. 
OSCAR: It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed... 
OSCAR: It's maddening! 
OSCAR: It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this. 
OSCAR: It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company. 
OSCAR: It's never gonna happen. 
OSCAR: It's not a fight. What other outcome could there be? 
OSCAR: It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece. 
OSCAR: It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened. 
OSCAR: It's not fair, you guys. 
OSCAR: It's not misleading. 
OSCAR: It's not pizza. 
OSCAR: It's not that funny. 
OSCAR: It's not that kind of ladle. 
OSCAR: It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me. 
OSCAR: It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid. 
OSCAR: It's possible. 
OSCAR: It's really not. 
OSCAR: It's, it's a completely different name! 
OSCAR: I've been here 8 years and I've never...   Rude. 
OSCAR: I've got a time share in Key West that might be available. 
OSCAR: Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff. 
OSCAR: Jan is smart. 
OSCAR: Jan, he went running that way. 
OSCAR: Jan. 
OSCAR: Jim what are you doing? 
OSCAR: Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond? 
OSCAR: Jim, he's not gonna star-  
OSCAR: Jim, I think I'm in your way.  
OSCAR: Jim, you let Michael fall in. 
OSCAR: Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon. 
OSCAR: Just   I don t wanna make assumptions based on people s physical appearances. 
OSCAR: Just leave it how you said... 
OSCAR: Just- no. No. 
OSCAR: Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me?  I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good.  Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza? 
OSCAR: Just take her name off of everything.  
OSCAR: Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg. 
OSCAR: Just to say "sterile" doesn't make it so. 
OSCAR: Kelly's on your side. 
OSCAR: Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out. 
OSCAR: Kevin! 
OSCAR: Kevin! 
OSCAR: Kevin! 
OSCAR: Kevin, c'mon. 
OSCAR: Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok? 
OSCAR: Kevin, move. I can t pull up the rug if you re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet. 
OSCAR: Kevin, no. 
OSCAR: Kevin, what? 
OSCAR: Kevin. 
OSCAR: Kevin? 
OSCAR: Knock, knock. Oh! 
OSCAR: Last year, he walked 18 miles. 
OSCAR: Last year, Michael's theme was "Bowl over the Competition!" So guess where we went. 
OSCAR: Let him expense it, Dwight. 
OSCAR: Let it ride. Let it all ride. 
OSCAR: Let me call you back. 
OSCAR: Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no. 
OSCAR: Like what? 
OSCAR: Like what? 
OSCAR: Listen to this. 
OSCAR: Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes? 
OSCAR: Manual. 
OSCAR: Martinez. 
OSCAR: Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me. Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian. 
OSCAR: Maybe over some coffee later? 
OSCAR: Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching. 
OSCAR: Maybe you should talk to her? Before... 
OSCAR: Maybe you're right, who are we to... 
OSCAR: Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky. 
OSCAR: Me too. 
OSCAR: Meaning what? 
OSCAR: Meredith! 
OSCAR: Meredith, I- 
OSCAR: Meredith, your boob is out. 
OSCAR: Merry Christmas to you. 
OSCAR: Mexican isn't offensive. 
OSCAR: Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty. 
OSCAR: Michael -- 
OSCAR: Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you? 
OSCAR: Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one. 
OSCAR: Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise. 
OSCAR: Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed. 
OSCAR: Michael left. 
OSCAR: Michael that doesn't seem... safe. 
OSCAR: Michael, are you having money problems? 
OSCAR: Michael, can I talk to you? 
OSCAR: Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian. 
OSCAR: Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker. 
OSCAR: Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat. 
OSCAR: Michael, I didn't ask to come up here. 
OSCAR: Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday.   
OSCAR: Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy. 
OSCAR: Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew. 
OSCAR: Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated. 
OSCAR: Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from? 
OSCAR: Michael, this is a presentation tool. 
OSCAR: Michael, This is insane. 
OSCAR: Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut? 
OSCAR: Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is? 
OSCAR: Michael, why? 
OSCAR: Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog... 
OSCAR: Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done. 
OSCAR: Michael. 
OSCAR: Michael. Reading. 
OSCAR: Michael... 
OSCAR: Michael... I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on.  
OSCAR: Michael? 
OSCAR: Michael? Poor Richard's? 
OSCAR: Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um...  I should have been more specific. 
OSCAR: Mm-hmm. 
OSCAR: Mmm. 
OSCAR: Mmm... 
OSCAR: Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show. 
OSCAR: More like fall cleaning.  
OSCAR: More or less. 
OSCAR: Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet? 
OSCAR: Mummies are real. There are mummies at museums. 
OSCAR: my dog Gerald is my life. 
OSCAR: My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters. 
OSCAR: My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time. 
OSCAR: My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that? 
OSCAR: My mom.  
OSCAR: My mother's in a wheelchair. 
OSCAR: My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if... 
OSCAR: My parents were Mexican. 
OSCAR: Narddog.  
OSCAR: Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular? 
OSCAR: Nice to meet you Mark! 
OSCAR: Nice to meet you.   
OSCAR: Nice to see you again, it was lovely! 
OSCAR: No horseplay. 
OSCAR: No kidding. 
OSCAR: No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I- 
OSCAR: No one else in this office is gay. 
OSCAR: No thank you. 
OSCAR: No! 
OSCAR: No! 
OSCAR: No! Come on! 
OSCAR: No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us! 
OSCAR: No, guys. 
OSCAR: No, I don t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it? 
OSCAR: No, I have not. 
OSCAR: No, I m a dog person. 
OSCAR: No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if...  Uh... yeah I'm gay. 
OSCAR: No, it s neat and tasteful, like most gay men s homes. The stereotype holds up. 
OSCAR: No, it's fine. 
OSCAR: No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead. 
OSCAR: No, Kevin --  
OSCAR: No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses. 
OSCAR: No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small! 
OSCAR: No, no, please. Please do not do this. 
OSCAR: No, no. Not even. 
OSCAR: No, thank you, Angela. 
OSCAR: No, that's a flush. 
OSCAR: No, they just made out. That's it. 
OSCAR: No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. 
OSCAR: No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it. 
OSCAR: No. 
OSCAR: No. 
OSCAR: No. 
OSCAR: No. 
OSCAR: No. 
OSCAR: No.  
OSCAR: No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts. 
OSCAR: No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster. 
OSCAR: No. Why would we be talking about the Senator? 
OSCAR: Not at all. 
OSCAR: Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things. Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt. 
OSCAR: Not occasionally. All the time. 
OSCAR: Nothing. I didn't say anything. 
OSCAR: Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine? 
OSCAR: Now? It's our Christmas party. 
OSCAR: Nuh uh. 
OSCAR: Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly. 
OSCAR: Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent.  
OSCAR: Office Administrator. So when did this happen? 
OSCAR: Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better. 
OSCAR: Oh my God, what happened? 
OSCAR: Oh my. That is small. 
OSCAR: Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday. 
OSCAR: Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but- Senator 
OSCAR: Oh you? 
OSCAR: Oh! 
OSCAR: Oh, Angela. 
OSCAR: Oh, come on. 
OSCAR: Oh, for God s sake.  
OSCAR: Oh, he's plenty strong. 
OSCAR: Oh, I m sure ...that s nothing. 
OSCAR: Oh, Michael's not going anywhere. 
OSCAR: Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you? 
OSCAR: Oh, my goodness. 
OSCAR: Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma. 
OSCAR: Oh, that's very funny. 
OSCAR: Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you. 
OSCAR: Oh, who needs a house that size? 
OSCAR: Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'. 
OSCAR: Oh, you think it's a choice? 
OSCAR: Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me.  
OSCAR: Oh. 
OSCAR: Oh.  
OSCAR: Oh. Did - did you see that? 
OSCAR: Oh... 
OSCAR: Oh... 
OSCAR: Oh... hey. 
OSCAR: Ok 
OSCAR: Ok everyone, turn off your mikes. 
OSCAR: Ok! 
OSCAR: Ok, I ve got my  
OSCAR: OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico. 
OSCAR: OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you. 
OSCAR: Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch. 
OSCAR: Ok, that's a joke. 
OSCAR: OK, the health care plan. 
OSCAR: Ok. 
OSCAR: OK. 
OSCAR: OK. 
OSCAR: OK.   Stanley, come on. 
OSCAR: Ok. I got one. 
OSCAR: Ok... 
OSCAR: Ok... 
OSCAR: okay 
OSCAR: Okay Pam. 
OSCAR: Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon. 
OSCAR: Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple- 
OSCAR: Okay, but look, you could have hit "mood". Would have played a... 
OSCAR: Okay, did you get it out of your system. 
OSCAR: Okay, I guess, it s just that Phillip got you something. 
OSCAR: Okay, I m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent. 
OSCAR: Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house. 
OSCAR: Okay, this is much worse than before. 
OSCAR: Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club. 
OSCAR: Okay. 
OSCAR: Okay. 
OSCAR: Okay. 
OSCAR: Okay. 
OSCAR: Okay. 
OSCAR: Okay.  
OSCAR: Okay. I'm done with this. 
OSCAR: One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population. Party 
OSCAR: One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same. 
OSCAR: One, two, three!  
OSCAR: One, two, three.  
OSCAR: Ooh. 
OSCAR: Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin. 
OSCAR: Or moon. 
OSCAR: Order reference number 00983-126. 
OSCAR: Our office has an unusually large number of  unusually large people. 
OSCAR: Ow! Robert?! 
OSCAR: Ow! You hit people with that thing? 
OSCAR: Pair of shoes! 
OSCAR: Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between "sane and others." Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The "coalition for reason" is extremely weak. 
OSCAR: Pam you look more beautiful now than ever. 
OSCAR: Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache. 
OSCAR: Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM. 
OSCAR: Pam, I'm sorry-- 
OSCAR: Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions. 
OSCAR: Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company. 
OSCAR: Pam, really? Come on. 
OSCAR: Pam, what can be done? 
OSCAR: Pam, you make more copies than anyone. 
OSCAR: Pam. 
OSCAR: Pam... I think Robert is gay. 
OSCAR: Pam's first celebrity crush. 
OSCAR: Pass. 
OSCAR: People, it s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man? 
OSCAR: Per mile. 
OSCAR: Perfect. 
OSCAR: Phyllis, Phyllis. 
OSCAR: Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet. 
OSCAR: Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy. 
OSCAR: Pleased to meet you. 
OSCAR: Plus everyone would know who you meant. 
OSCAR: Probably went to his head. 
OSCAR: Put the "q" there!  Sorry I yelled. 
OSCAR: Put the "q" there, sweetie. 
OSCAR: Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead? 
OSCAR: Really, ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant. 
OSCAR: Really? 
OSCAR: Really? 
OSCAR: Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal? 
OSCAR: Right there. 
OSCAR: Right, Matt.  I know what I'm doing, Pam. 
OSCAR: Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle - 
OSCAR: Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor. 
OSCAR: Role call. 
OSCAR: Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend! 
OSCAR: Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales. 
OSCAR: Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services. 
OSCAR: Salman Rushdie. 
OSCAR: See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot. 
OSCAR: See you there. 
OSCAR: Senator Lipton, nice to see you. Senator 
OSCAR: Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you? Senator 
OSCAR: Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar. 
OSCAR: Separate bathrooms. 
OSCAR: Seriously, Kevin. I m just gonna have to go to the store. 
OSCAR: Settle down gentlemen. 
OSCAR: She doesn t know I m living with a straight woman. I don t want to get her hopes up. 
OSCAR: She doesn t know. I shouldn t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love. 
OSCAR: She got pregnant before the wedding. 
OSCAR: She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out. 
OSCAR: She has to know. 
OSCAR: She s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog. 
OSCAR: She's always late, she's always rude... 
OSCAR: She's beautiful. 
OSCAR: She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller. 
OSCAR: She's stuck on that one thing. 
OSCAR: She's the one. 
OSCAR: Shh! 
OSCAR: Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay. 
OSCAR: Shhh! 
OSCAR: Since Christmas. 
OSCAR: Six.  
OSCAR: Skin cancer is treatable. 
OSCAR: So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt. 
OSCAR: So happy hour. 
OSCAR: So happy. Yeah. 
OSCAR: So how was your date? 
OSCAR: So Michael, what do you think? 
OSCAR: So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it. 
OSCAR: So she's really going to be fine? 
OSCAR: So ten thousand of your dollars is worth one real dollar? 
OSCAR: So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again-  
OSCAR: So what do you think? 
OSCAR: So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin? 
OSCAR: So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time. 
OSCAR: So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer... 
OSCAR: So you have an extra dollar. 
OSCAR: So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this? 
OSCAR: So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work? 
OSCAR: So... 
OSCAR: Someone please explain it to Kevin. 
OSCAR: sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here. 
OSCAR: Sounds like they just got to go home with pay. 
OSCAR: Stanley, could you look up "accomplices"? 
OSCAR: State senator. 
OSCAR: State Senator. 
OSCAR: Stay alive! I'm getting help! 
OSCAR: Still said it, so...  
OSCAR: Still, that's not anything. 
OSCAR: Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better. 
OSCAR: Stop hitting me! 
OSCAR: Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer. 
OSCAR: Sure thing Pam, can't wait. 
OSCAR: Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion? 
OSCAR: Sure. 
OSCAR: Sure. 
OSCAR: Sure.  
OSCAR: Sure. Hoops! 
OSCAR: Sweet! 
OSCAR: Tasteless. 
OSCAR: Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO. 
OSCAR: Ten percent? 
OSCAR: Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar. 
OSCAR: Terrific. 
OSCAR: Thank God. 
OSCAR: Thank you David. 
OSCAR: Thank you Michael. It's beautiful. 
OSCAR: Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them. 
OSCAR: Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people. 
OSCAR: Thank you, Michael. 
OSCAR: Thank you. 
OSCAR: Thank you. 
OSCAR: Thank you. 
OSCAR: Thank you. It didn't even take that long. Cookie 
OSCAR: Thank... Yeah... 
OSCAR: Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of .. 
OSCAR: That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom. 
OSCAR: That isn't ethics. Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good. This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules. 
OSCAR: That reeks, and I'm trying to eat. 
OSCAR: That s enough Kevin. 
OSCAR: That s enough! 
OSCAR: That s that s awful, Angela. I m so sorry. 
OSCAR: That s the reason Kevin got fired. It s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight,   A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.  He was home by 4:45 that day. 
OSCAR: That seems... quick. Even for lesbians. 
OSCAR: That sounds fake. 
OSCAR: That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that. 
OSCAR: That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form. 
OSCAR: That was you, Kevin. 
OSCAR: That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole... 
OSCAR: That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus! 
OSCAR: That's a lot. 
OSCAR: That's a tough one. 
OSCAR: That's as simple as I can make it. 
OSCAR: That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony. 
OSCAR: That's funny. 
OSCAR: That's Gerald.  
OSCAR: That's gotta be tough. 
OSCAR: That's great. 
OSCAR: That's her private property. 
OSCAR: That's impossible. 
OSCAR: That's no accident. 
OSCAR: That's not. 
OSCAR: That's offensive. 
OSCAR: That's print. 
OSCAR: That's really not our job. 
OSCAR: That's tasteless, Gabe. 
OSCAR: That's the original. 
OSCAR: That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place.   
OSCAR: That's too funny. 
OSCAR: That's... that's... that's very generous. 
OSCAR: The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content. 
OSCAR: The Atlantic. 
OSCAR: The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO. 
OSCAR: The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael.   
OSCAR: The coffee's supposed to be here at 9. 
OSCAR: The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did. 
OSCAR: The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers. 
OSCAR: The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like. 
OSCAR: The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus! 
OSCAR: The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother. 
OSCAR: The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it. 
OSCAR: The note. So "holier than thou". 
OSCAR: The numbers are correct, Michael. 
OSCAR: The one of all women? 
OSCAR: The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate. 
OSCAR: The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win. 
OSCAR: The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that. 
OSCAR: Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability? 
OSCAR: There he is! Hey, hey, hey. 
OSCAR: There he is. 
OSCAR: There is no story. 
OSCAR: There you go. 
OSCAR: There's a promo for the new documentary on the web. 
OSCAR: There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment. 
OSCAR: There's no theater in that. 
OSCAR: These aren't announcements. 
OSCAR: These questions are bush league. 
OSCAR: These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them? 
OSCAR: They can. 
OSCAR: They caught us kissing on Halloween. 
OSCAR: They finally let you do it! 
OSCAR: They happened to speak Spanish. 
OSCAR: They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich . I m a man. So I m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out. 
OSCAR: They're a descriptive people. 
OSCAR: They're our largest client. 
OSCAR: Thirty-one is humanly impossible. 
OSCAR: This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow. 
OSCAR: This confirms three 
OSCAR: This constitutes identity fraud. 
OSCAR: This could be the affair that you re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are.  But uh, he s probably not gay. He s straight. He s straight, so... 
OSCAR: This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window.  
OSCAR: This is a lot of credit card debt. 
OSCAR: This is great.  Oh. 
OSCAR: This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible. 
OSCAR: This is interesting. 
OSCAR: This is not good. 
OSCAR: This is nuts. 
OSCAR: This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs. 
OSCAR: This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now! 
OSCAR: This is why I'm here? 
OSCAR: This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment. 
OSCAR: This sounds like a get rich quick scheme. 
OSCAR: Those are the bullet points. 
OSCAR: Those figures I gave you? They're false. 
OSCAR: Those guys always change back, Angela. 
OSCAR: Time's almost up. How many are left? 
OSCAR: Tin Man. Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance. 
OSCAR: To be Edwardian. His best work. 
OSCAR: To both these bears. 
OSCAR: To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company. 
OSCAR: Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine. 
OSCAR: Toby, how do you propose that we- Andy:Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused? 
OSCAR: Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right? 
OSCAR: Too soon.  
OSCAR: Totally, that's great. 
OSCAR: Try another sentence. 
OSCAR: Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help. 
OSCAR: Try this one.  
OSCAR: Turkey is a healthy meat. 
OSCAR: TV. 
OSCAR: Twelve hundred dollars. What's a Core Blaster Extreme? 
OSCAR: Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense. 
OSCAR: U..s..a. U- 
OSCAR: Uh, I'm sorry to bother you. 
OSCAR: Uh, nice party Michael. 
OSCAR: Uhh. All right, who else is here?  
OSCAR: Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos. 
OSCAR: Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me... Senator 
OSCAR: Um.. 
OSCAR: Ummm... 
OSCAR: Un-be-liev-a-ble. 
OSCAR: Use it in a sentence. 
OSCAR: User error. I ve heard of that happening to other people. 
OSCAR: Very brave.  
OSCAR: Very much so. 
OSCAR: Wait a minute. You re not thinking of living in a  
OSCAR: Wait!  It s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it. 
OSCAR: Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself. 
OSCAR: WASSUUUUP!  
OSCAR: Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move. 
OSCAR: We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit. 
OSCAR: We are together. Romantically. Nail 
OSCAR: We can stay a little longer. 
OSCAR: We don t get it. 
OSCAR: We got it! Wow! We got it! 
OSCAR: We have missiles too. 
OSCAR: We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget. 
OSCAR: We knew. Ryan told us. 
OSCAR: We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas. 
OSCAR: We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need. 
OSCAR: We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite. Senator 
OSCAR: We were never lovers! 
OSCAR: We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it. 
OSCAR: We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises. 
OSCAR: We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no? 
OSCAR: Well  
OSCAR: Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family. 
OSCAR: Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month. 
OSCAR: We'll see. 
OSCAR: Well this is what 
OSCAR: Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent. 
OSCAR: Well, he s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites. 
OSCAR: Well, I am sorry Kevin. 
OSCAR: Well, I bet it was a smash. 
OSCAR: Well, I don't like giving him bad news. 
OSCAR: Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero. 
OSCAR: Well, if there s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I  
OSCAR: Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote. 
OSCAR: Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity- 
OSCAR: Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is. 
OSCAR: Well, there must be someone who stands out. 
OSCAR: Well, those aren't Pam's strong points. 
OSCAR: Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do. 
OSCAR: Well... 
OSCAR: Well... 
OSCAR: Well... 
OSCAR: Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight? 
OSCAR: Well? 
OSCAR: Well? 
OSCAR: We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then? 
OSCAR: We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point. 
OSCAR: We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are. 
OSCAR: Wha- 
OSCAR: What about February 2nd? 
OSCAR: What are we, five? 
OSCAR: What are you doing? 
OSCAR: What are you doing? 
OSCAR: What are you doing? 
OSCAR: What are you doing?! 
OSCAR: What are you guys talkin' about? 
OSCAR: What are you implying? 
OSCAR: What are you implying? 
OSCAR: What are you talking about? I just did this now. 
OSCAR: What bathhouse? 
OSCAR: What connotations, Michael? You meant something. 
OSCAR: What do you see in her? Wh -- what do you see in Angela? 
OSCAR: What does that mean? 
OSCAR: What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night?  
OSCAR: What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me. 
OSCAR: What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it , it makes sense  But it... it was still wrong. 
OSCAR: What happened to Phyllis? 
OSCAR: What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow. 
OSCAR: What have you been doing? 
OSCAR: What I mean to say is we don't want to. 
OSCAR: What if it were salads? 
OSCAR: What is first base with Angela? 
OSCAR: What is it? 
OSCAR: What is that? 
OSCAR: What is this about? 
OSCAR: What is this? 
OSCAR: What is this? 
OSCAR: What is wrong with you? She is engaged. 
OSCAR: What part Native American? 
OSCAR: What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right? 
OSCAR: What the hell is going on here? 
OSCAR: What the hell, Dwight? 
OSCAR: What the hell?! 
OSCAR: What time do we have to come in? 
OSCAR: What town do Holly's parents live in? 
OSCAR: What was that? 
OSCAR: What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises. 
OSCAR: What--- What are you winking for? 
OSCAR: What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him! 
OSCAR: What... Ryan, where did you get this picture?  
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
OSCAR: What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings? 
OSCAR: What? No! 
OSCAR: What? What? 
OSCAR: What?! 
OSCAR: What?! 
OSCAR: What's 15% of 200?   Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus. 
OSCAR: What's going on? 
OSCAR: What's number one? 
OSCAR: What's that supposed to mean? 
OSCAR: What's the joke? 
OSCAR: What's the next one? 
OSCAR: What's up, Pam? 
OSCAR: What's your money situation? 
OSCAR: What's your point. 
OSCAR: When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain. 
OSCAR: When is the funeral? 
OSCAR: When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds.  
OSCAR: When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure.  Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there.  Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride. 
OSCAR: Where are you getting this information? 
OSCAR: Where did you get this? 
OSCAR: Where is this from? That is so upsetting! 
OSCAR: Where was that. 
OSCAR: Where'd you get that kind of money? 
OSCAR: Which on in particular? 
OSCAR: Who are you dating in the public arena? 
OSCAR: Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this? 
OSCAR: Who is that? 
OSCAR: Who is this guy again? 
OSCAR: Who s spotting who? Don t use the bike in the corner. That s Bruce s. Jeremy says  
OSCAR: Who? 
OSCAR: Whoa! Whoa! Dwight!  
OSCAR: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... 
OSCAR: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look. 
OSCAR: Whoo, whoo, whoo. 
OSCAR: Who's is it? Who wrote that? 
OSCAR: Who's the senator? 
OSCAR: Why are we doing this? 
OSCAR: Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish? 
OSCAR: Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker? 
OSCAR: Why are you telling us this? 
OSCAR: Why aren't you in New York? 
OSCAR: Why did Binghamton close? 
OSCAR: Why didn t you pack the apple snacks? 
OSCAR: Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch? 
OSCAR: Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time. 
OSCAR: Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby? 
OSCAR: Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office? 
OSCAR: Why do you say that? 
OSCAR: why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela 
OSCAR: Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe. 
OSCAR: Why don't you just ask him-- 
OSCAR: Why don't you just have an apple? 
OSCAR: Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left. 
OSCAR: Why won't you do Andy? 
OSCAR: Why would I love jail? 
OSCAR: Why would someone hug you? 
OSCAR: Why would we take the dog? 
OSCAR: Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards? 
OSCAR: Why would you choose a pencil Andy? 
OSCAR: Why would you throw something wet at me? 
OSCAR: Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you. 
OSCAR: Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face? 
OSCAR: Why? 
OSCAR: Why? 
OSCAR: Why? 
OSCAR: Why'd you say dollars? 
OSCAR: Will you marry me? 
OSCAR: With all due respect we know what we re defending 
OSCAR: Wow, it's so... healthy. 
OSCAR: Wow. 
OSCAR: Wow. 
OSCAR: Wow. 
OSCAR: Wow. 
OSCAR: Wow. 
OSCAR: Wow.  
OSCAR: Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay. 
OSCAR: Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up. 
OSCAR: Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or? 
OSCAR: Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother s, and I ll meet you at Poor Richard s in an hour. 
OSCAR: Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence. 
OSCAR: Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here? 
OSCAR: Yeah I think I came down with the flu. 
OSCAR: Yeah sure. 
OSCAR: Yeah! 
OSCAR: Yeah, brosef. 
OSCAR: Yeah, but Jim, Dwight s a weirdo. We can t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos. 
OSCAR: Yeah, but you re not gay. You re not gay. 
OSCAR: Yeah, Dwight and Andy. We were here. 
OSCAR: Yeah, he's in a ladle. 
OSCAR: Yeah, I feel terrible about it. 
OSCAR: Yeah, it surprised us all. I'll tell you why. Because when they--- 
OSCAR: Yeah, it was. 
OSCAR: Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot. 
OSCAR: Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included. 
OSCAR: Yeah, totally. Well, congrats! 
OSCAR: Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there.  Just a couple of hours to kill before work. 
OSCAR: Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to.. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Yeah.  David 
OSCAR: Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner. 
OSCAR: Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know. 
OSCAR: Yeah? 
OSCAR: Yep, here they are. 
OSCAR: Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now? 
OSCAR: Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan. 
OSCAR: Yes! 
OSCAR: Yes! 
OSCAR: Yes! 
OSCAR: Yes! 
OSCAR: Yes! 
OSCAR: Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now? 
OSCAR: Yes! The freaking PDA! 
OSCAR: Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV! 
OSCAR: Yes, he's innocent. 
OSCAR: Yes, it is. 
OSCAR: Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes. 
OSCAR: Yes, she is. And clinically insane. 
OSCAR: Yes, they can. 
OSCAR: Yes, yes, absolutely. 
OSCAR: Yes, yes, yes! 
OSCAR: Yes. 
OSCAR: Yes. 
OSCAR: Yes. 
OSCAR: Yes. 
OSCAR: Yes. 
OSCAR: Yes.  
OSCAR: Yes. Sorry about that. 
OSCAR: Yes? 
OSCAR: Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it s business as usual. 
OSCAR: YOLO!  
OSCAR: You - 
OSCAR: You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing. 
OSCAR: You are busy! We're in a meeting! 
OSCAR: you are incorrigible! 
OSCAR: You call him! 
OSCAR: You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300. 
OSCAR: You can't leave a dog in a parked car.  Snowboarder, it figures. 
OSCAR: You could all be doing this, just saying. 
OSCAR: You did it, Kevin. 
OSCAR: You did what? 
OSCAR: You got a bonus check? 
OSCAR: You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing. 
OSCAR: You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy? 
OSCAR: You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure.  
OSCAR: You have a brother? 
OSCAR: You have an address yet in Colorado? 
OSCAR: You have met a lesbian in real life, right? 
OSCAR: You have no sense of boundaries Michael. 
OSCAR: You have your cats on Nanny-Cam? 
OSCAR: You haven't had sex? 
OSCAR: You heard me correctly. 
OSCAR: You hired someone to hit me with a pipe! 
OSCAR: You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face. 
OSCAR: You invited someone? 
OSCAR: You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married. 
OSCAR: You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink. 
OSCAR: You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book. 
OSCAR: You know what? I will take Comstock. 
OSCAR: You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who- 
OSCAR: You need those things. Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael? 
OSCAR: You okay? You okay, Stanley? 
OSCAR: You owe me and apology. 
OSCAR: You pushed Darryl out the window? 
OSCAR: You put a note in my food? 
OSCAR: You re not gay. 
OSCAR: You re right. There should be a monument to this. 
OSCAR: You re welcome. Let s go get Phillip. Then we ll get your stuff  
OSCAR: You really have to say "oh yeah" every time you eat a candy bar? 
OSCAR: You said that yesterday. 
OSCAR: You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball. 
OSCAR: You sound pretty defensive Michael. 
OSCAR: You suppose? 
OSCAR: You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It s not much. But if you see it in the right way And that s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn t once show me doing my origami. 
OSCAR: You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you? 
OSCAR: You ve gotta be kidding me. 
OSCAR: You ve heard about it? 
OSCAR: You wanted to see me? 
OSCAR: You wanted to talk to us Deangelo? 
OSCAR: You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc. 
OSCAR: You--- you call--- you called her. 
OSCAR: Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were slave owners. 
OSCAR: Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves. 
OSCAR: Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars. 
OSCAR: Your office is full of genitalia. 
OSCAR: You're a saint, Pam. 
OSCAR: You're clearly snooping. 
OSCAR: You're doing great Michael, look at you go! 
OSCAR: You're gonna get us a copier then? 
OSCAR: You're not gonna answer the phone? 
OSCAR: You're not sure that you have the job. 
OSCAR: You're right. You're right.  Oh, okay bye. 
OSCAR: You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her. 
OSCAR: You're the one who said we needed more culture. 
OSCAR: You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older.  You sound ignorant. 
OSCAR: You're too heavy! 
OSCAR: You're waterboarding me! 
OTHERS:  Phew. Oh! No, mm-mm.  
OTHERS: Hey! 
OTHERS: Yeah. 
OTHERS: Yeah. Yes, it's better. It's great. 
OVERHEAD:  Looking so crazy, my baby. I'm not myself lately. I'm foolish. I don't do this. I've been playing myself. Baby I don't care. Cuz your love got the best of me. And baby you're making a fool of me. 
OVERHEAD:  You all ready for this?

I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin,  this kid in a few years. 
PACKER: Alright. 
PACKER: And what kind of stripper did you get? 
PACKER: Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.

PACKER: I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a  of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it. 
PACKER: I am. It was my rock bottom. 
PACKER: I can do it. 
PACKER: I don t see what that gets us, but I m a team player. 
PACKER: I don't think you get it. 
PACKER: I have a full day of sales calls. 
PACKER: I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch. 
PACKER: I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time. 
PACKER: I will be here. 
PACKER: If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute. Robert 
PACKER: I'll be there at 6:00 
PACKER: It was pretty big. 
PACKER: It would be an honor, ma'am. 
PACKER: It's OK. I'm over it. 
PACKER: I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes? 
PACKER: Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass. 
PACKER: Just get one for the girls too. That evens it out. You know, separate but equal. 
PACKER: Lame. Why don't witches wear panties? 
PACKER: Left it in the middle of your office. 
PACKER: Like 10 words a minute... talking. 
PACKER: Maybe next "queer." Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash? 
PACKER: Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation? 
PACKER: Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101. If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard. 
PACKER: Nice.  Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy? 
PACKER: No. 
PACKER: No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head.  Hey. I have a crazy feeling  that you are really gonna like this. 
PACKER: Not good enough (clicks tongue) 
PACKER: Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me! 
PACKER: Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they? 
PACKER: Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle.  
PACKER: Oh, yikes. Incoming-  
PACKER: Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier. 
PACKER: OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did. 
PACKER: Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips. 
PACKER: Pacman need a drinky. 
PACKER: Quick query, Halpert. 
PACKER: Quick somebody help! Help the man!  
PACKER: Schrute s out to get me. But I m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator. 
PACKER: Shut it! 
PACKER: Shut up! 
PACKER: Sit on the throne, Michael. 
PACKER: So a guy goes home, tells his wife, "Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery." She goes, "Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?" He goes, "I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!"  Boom! 
PACKER: So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends.  
PACKER: Special delivery! 
PACKER: Still queer? 
PACKER: Still queer? 
PACKER: Sup? 
PACKER: Thank you. (Dwight looks on angrily) 
PACKER: That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting? 
PACKER: That's great. 
PACKER: That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made. 
PACKER: There he is. 
PACKER: There he is. Good one. 
PACKER: There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh...  
PACKER: They are women, right? 
PACKER: They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim. 
PACKER: This is great. This is gonna be great. 
PACKER: Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense. 
PACKER: Uh  
PACKER: Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture? 
PACKER: Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man. 
PACKER: Well, no. I got nothing. 
PACKER: We're talking blonde incompetent. 
PACKER: What happened? 
PACKER: What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom?  This guy! 
PACKER: What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh?  
PACKER: What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me. 
PACKER: When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works.  You'd spin off right. I'd spin off- 
PACKER: Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably. 
PACKER: Whoops!  
PACKER: Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology s just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'. 
PACKER: Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that? Kevin's 
PACKER: Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch- 
PACKER: Yeah, Mike, still nothing. 
PACKER: Yeah. 
PACKER: Yep 
PACKER: You can't put me down. Too strong! 
PACKER: You didn't order a stripper? Have you ever even been to a bachelor party? 
PACKER: You took the ice queen? I don't buy it. 
PACKER: Your mom, you gay nerd! 
PACKER: Yup. Tallahassee, let's go. 
PAGES: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing  the White Whale . Look at all that sweet blubber.

PAM:   Don't look up. Don't look up.   
PAM:   Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail? 
PAM:   Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet. 
PAM:   Erin. Michael wants to see you. 
PAM:   Good luck. 
PAM:   Good morning, Michael. 
PAM:   Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good... 
PAM:   Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work. 
PAM:   Hi everyone! 
PAM:   Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message. 
PAM:   Hyuh!   Well, look at that, we win! 
PAM:   I can do it. 
PAM:   I can see you! 
PAM:   I got it! 
PAM:   I just talked to my advisor. Failing.

PAM:   Oh, oh, excuse me! Sorry. Sorry, no. It's, uh, it's a paper company now. It's not for the church. 
PAM:   Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah. 
PAM:   Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin. 
PAM:   Oof! 
PAM:   Ooh, cute shoes online. 
PAM:   Right Dwight is loud. 
PAM:   Right. 
PAM:   Shush.   Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic. 
PAM:   So you know Stacy, right? 
PAM:   Sounds neat. 
PAM:   Sure. Uh huh. 
PAM:   Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight. 
PAM:   That was weird. 
PAM:   That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said! 
PAM:   Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here- 
PAM:   Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really... 
PAM:   We got Vikram! 
PAM:   Well, I should go. 
PAM:   What are we doing at your parent's house? 
PAM:   What was that? 
PAM:   What? 
PAM:   What? I'm not in love with her. 
PAM:   When did you add this to the list? 
PAM:   Who is it? 
PAM:   Who's there? 
PAM:   Why are you still here? 
PAM:   Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me? 
PAM:   Yeah I'm fine. Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go. 
PAM:   Yeah, that's no problem. 
PAM:   You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1-- 
PAM:  "Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful." 
PAM:  "Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors." Nobody dress like that.  
PAM:  ... Thank you. 
PAM:  ...back so soon. 
PAM:  About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say. Yes, I know. Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, I think I am.  I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... 
PAM:  Alakazam! 
PAM:  Angela, are you ready for the wedding? 
PAM:  Anyone else? Nooo. 
PAM:  Are the pens here? 
PAM:  Are you coming? 
PAM:  Are you kidding me? 
PAM:  Are you kidding? 
PAM:  Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand.  Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want?  Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice. 
PAM:  Awesome. 
PAM:  Awww, he did that for me? 
PAM:  Beers? You closed it? 
PAM:  But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict.  And I just had to get her clean. 
PAM:  Bye, Stanley! Love you!  
PAM:  Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk. 
PAM:  Can I get a drink? 
PAM:  Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally? 
PAM:  Can you tell us what happened? 
PAM:  Cece went down. 
PAM:  Chicken. 
PAM:  Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week. 
PAM:  Come in. 
PAM:  Conference room. Everybody. Now! 
PAM:  Conference room? 
PAM:  Congratulations, Dwight. 
PAM:  Creed, I'm all done. My turn. 
PAM:  Cut it out. 
PAM:  Darryl! Andy! 
PAM:  Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this? 
PAM:  Did she see me? 
PAM:  Did you need me to take notes? 
PAM:  Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile. 
PAM:  Don't tell Jim. 
PAM:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. 
PAM:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you. 
PAM:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just one moment, I'll transfer you. 
PAM:  Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn t work here anymore. 
PAM:  Dunder Mifflin. 
PAM:  Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too.  Sorry. What's up? 
PAM:  Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam.  Uh, yeah.  Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott. 
PAM:  Dwight stopped the device! 
PAM:  Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends. 
PAM:  Everybody dance now   
PAM:  Everyone's driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people? 
PAM:  Excuse me, I have to get back to work. 
PAM:  Family picture! 
PAM:  Flooded. 
PAM:  Frank and beans! 
PAM:  Go ahead. I think it's your turn. 
PAM:  Go up and check on him. He's upset. 
PAM:  Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure. 
PAM:  Good luck. 
PAM:  Gross. I love it. 
PAM:  Ha-ha. 
PAM:  He looks happy. 
PAM:  He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him. 
PAM:  hello! 
PAM:  Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell,  Hey, kool-aid.  Yeah, your mama s fat. This is Pam Halpert. 
PAM:  Hello? 
PAM:  Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural?  Oh, my God! 
PAM:  Here.  Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight.  
PAM:  Hey  What happened here? 
PAM:  Hey baby, what's up? 
PAM:  Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight! 
PAM:  Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here.  
PAM:  Hey Ryan. Welcome back -- 
PAM:  Hey Toby. 
PAM:  Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that... 
PAM:  hey! 
PAM:  Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day. 
PAM:  Hey! It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly? 
PAM:  Hey! You can just give her your extension. 
PAM:  Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator. 
PAM:  Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital? 
PAM:  Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow. 
PAM:  Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second? 
PAM:  Hey, Jim. It's Pam. 
PAM:  Hey, Jim. It's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back! 
PAM:  Hey, my aunt told me something neat. 
PAM:  Hey, Phyllis. You all right? 
PAM:  Hey, Ryan, are you ok? 
PAM:  Hey, stranger! 
PAM:  Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something. 
PAM:  Hey, um... 
PAM:  Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe. 
PAM:  Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse? 
PAM:  Hey. 
PAM:  Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day. 
PAM:  Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately. 
PAM:  Hey. Thanks for ratting me out! 
PAM:  Hey. What are you doing? 
PAM:  Hi, Michael, hi, Michael 
PAM:  Hi. 
PAM:  Hi. 
PAM:  Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you. 
PAM:  Hmm. 
PAM:  Hmm. 
PAM:  Honey. 
PAM:  How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy! 
PAM:  How's it going? 
PAM:  I am.  It's about the Save The Date. 
PAM:  I am. I am the office administrator! Window treatment 
PAM:  I didn't, it's from corporate. 
PAM:  I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party. 
PAM:  I don't know. I think Michael has a date. 
PAM:  I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe. 
PAM:  I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I m gonna limit myself to one shrub. 
PAM:  I hate you.  
PAM:  I have good cards. 
PAM:  I have never seen so many parking tickets. 
PAM:  I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it. 
PAM:  I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela. 
PAM:  I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks. 
PAM:  I m so sorry. I hate this. You re better. 
PAM:  I m sorry. Is there a question? Woman 
PAM:  I need you to sign this! So bad! 
PAM:  I think it'll be okay. 
PAM:  I think you have a date. 
PAM:  I think you look nice. Michael and 
PAM:  I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers.  Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be.  Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know. 
PAM:  I wish. 
PAM:  I'll take those. Thanks.  
PAM:  I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you. 
PAM:  I'm amazing.  
PAM:  I'm gonna do it. 
PAM:  I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive. 
PAM:  I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch. 
PAM:  I'm sorry, what was the question? 
PAM:  In the name of Nutcracker Christmas. 
PAM:  Is that right? 
PAM:  It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later. 
PAM:  It s fine. It s just a seating arrangement. Doesn t matter. 
PAM:  It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this! 
PAM:  It wasn't. I swear. 
PAM:  It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God! 
PAM:  It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now.  
PAM:  It's gonna be OK. 
PAM:  It's gorgeous, Angela. 
PAM:  It's just, like, so creepy. 
PAM:  It's too much. 
PAM:  Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um,  that's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can. 
PAM:  Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you... Store 
PAM:  Jim, Jim, get her. 
PAM:  Join the club. 
PAM:  Just go in. Just go in, he probably forgot to text you. 
PAM:  Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ... 
PAM:  Just tell me. 
PAM:  Kelly has been a handful in the past. 
PAM:  Lesson learned. 
PAM:  Like... like what? 
PAM:  Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes. 
PAM:  Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands. 
PAM:  Looks great. 
PAM:  Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner. 
PAM:  Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling.  Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn. 
PAM:  Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna? 
PAM:  Michael! 
PAM:  Michael! Michael! 
PAM:  Michael, Carol Stills for you. 
PAM:  Michael, it's Ryan for you. 
PAM:  Michael?  He's over here! 
PAM:  Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder. 
PAM:  Mmmm. 
PAM:  Mouse trap.  
PAM:  Nevermind. 
PAM:  No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly. 
PAM:  No, he hasn't picked one yet. 
PAM:  No, I don't want to go, I don't want to. 
PAM:  No, I was just checking out my present.  
PAM:  No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years. 
PAM:  No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go. 
PAM:  No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green. 
PAM:  Oh boy. Oh no, I m not laughing at you. I m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning. 
PAM:  Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that. 
PAM:  Oh my god! Pam's 
PAM:  Oh my god! The yearbook picture! 
PAM:  Oh my god. 
PAM:  Oh my God. What century is this? 
PAM:  Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible. 
PAM:  Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you. 
PAM:  Oh, big yawn. 
PAM:  Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo! 
PAM:  Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you.  Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio? 
PAM:  Oh, I m sorry. I feel like you ve already been working insanely hard. 
PAM:  Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown! 
PAM:  Oh, my God! 
PAM:  Oh, my God! Go, go! 
PAM:  Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome. 
PAM:  Oh, my God. 
PAM:  Oh, my gosh, it s choreographed! 
PAM:  Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called. The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so... 
PAM:  Oh, text from Jim.  This is getting very weird. Will explain later.  
PAM:  Oh, text from Kevin. 
PAM:  Oh, thank you. 
PAM:  Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow. 
PAM:  Oh, would that make you feel better? 
PAM:  Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather. 
PAM:  Oh. 
PAM:  Oh.  No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite. 
PAM:  Oh. No, no.  We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together. 
PAM:  Oh. You couldn't have watered it? 
PAM:  Oh... I don't know. 
PAM:  ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! 
PAM:  Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person? 
PAM:  Ok, you want me to read 'em? 
PAM:  Ok. 
PAM:  Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot. 
PAM:  Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue. 
PAM:  Okay, see you later. 
PAM:  Okay. 
PAM:  Okay. 
PAM:  Okay. 
PAM:  One night...     
PAM:  Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha. 
PAM:  Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh... 
PAM:  Ooooohhh no! 
PAM:  Oscar. 
PAM:  Pam & 
PAM:  Pam Halpert. 
PAM:  Papier-mache? 
PAM:  Phyllis. Delivery 
PAM:  Please hold for Ms. Black. 
PAM:  Popcorn anyone? 
PAM:  Same religion. 
PAM:  Scuse me? 
PAM:  She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again? 
PAM:  Should you really be so blatant about that? 
PAM:  So listen, we have to really scuff this up. 
PAM:  So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want? 
PAM:  Somebody needs a change. 
PAM:  Stop, I can't breathe. 
PAM:  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert. 
PAM:  Tell us who defaced the mural! 
PAM:  Thank you. 
PAM:  Thank you. 
PAM:  Thank you. 
PAM:  Thank you. 
PAM:  Thanks Toby. 
PAM:  Thanks, mom! 
PAM:  Thanks. You don't need to stay here. 
PAM:  That's crazy! 
PAM:  That's perfect! 
PAM:  The building s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel. 
PAM:  The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas. 
PAM:  The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It s so cute no one seems to mind. 
PAM: - the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park. 
PAM:  There s nothing down here. 
PAM:  These are gross. 
PAM:  This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling. 
PAM:  This is the best burger I've ever had, babe. 
PAM:  This one's for all you ladies out there. 
PAM:  Toilets!  
PAM:  Ugh, your turn. 
PAM:  Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it. 
PAM:  Um, I m sorry. I have to go. My daughter s a ladybug. I know that doesn t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you. Parent in audience 
PAM:  Um, Ok. Well? 
PAM:  Um, that's all we brought. 
PAM:  Um. 
PAM:  Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me? 
PAM:  Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up. 
PAM:  Wait! 
PAM:  We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant. 
PAM:  We should probably head back. 
PAM:  We still surprise each other. 
PAM:  Well, it's not exactly a vacation. 
PAM:  What are you doing? 
PAM:  What are you doing? 
PAM:  What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck? 
PAM:  What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer! 
PAM:  What! You knew? 
PAM:  What. 
PAM:  What? 
PAM:  What? 
PAM:  What?  Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you! 
PAM:  What's that? Is that a- 
PAM:  What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles? 
PAM:  What's the news? 
PAM:  Where are you going? 
PAM:  Who are you putting down? 
PAM:  Who is it? 
PAM:  Who s that? 
PAM:  Why don't you talk to him about it? 
PAM:  Why? 
PAM:  With cream and sugar? 
PAM:  Wow! 
PAM:  Wow. I didn't know you kept this. 
PAM:  Yay, Phyllis! 
PAM:  Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs. 
PAM:  Yeah, I hate those endings. 
PAM:  Yeah, lunch was wonderful! 
PAM:  Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this. 
PAM:  Yeah. 
PAM:  Yeah. 
PAM:  Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there. 
PAM:  Yeah? 
PAM:  Yeah?  I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me. 
PAM:  Yee. 
PAM:  Yep, yep. 
PAM:  Yes! 
PAM:  Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat. 
PAM:  Yes! Way to go.  See that? 
PAM:  Yes! Yes! I would love to! 
PAM:  Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations? 
PAM:  Yes, thank you.  
PAM:  Yes? 
PAM:  You called Stanley's wife? 
PAM:  You did that? 
PAM:  You have new music? 
PAM:  You have to keep your hands down, Michael. 
PAM:  You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00. 
PAM:  You should do more stuff like that. 
PAM:  You wanted me? 
PAM:  You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing.  Are you a golfer? 
PAM:  You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks. 
PAM:  You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this. 
PAM:  You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny. 
PAM: "He is a drifter out to sea." 
PAM: "Jelp?" J-e-l-p? 
PAM: "Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches." 
PAM: "Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle. I'm too shy to tell you that I love you." 
PAM: "Yeah, right," what? 
PAM: $100 now for sure. 
PAM: $60,000. 
PAM: . Is everything okay? 
PAM: ... dangling participle... 
PAM: ... Got you. 
PAM: ... Square is fine. 
PAM: ... still burned in my eyes. 
PAM: ... We're dating. 
PAM: ... What? 
PAM: ... your problem. 
PAM: .... Corner idea? 
PAM: ...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black. 
PAM: ...And it's all from the same series. 
PAM: ...because that's what happens every time! 
PAM: ...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom. 
PAM: ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here? 
PAM: ...kiss. 
PAM: ...noooo 
PAM: ...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink. 
PAM: ...Oh. That's... fun for him. 
PAM: ...That's it.   
PAM: ...we wanted to say thank you- 
PAM: ...what your friendship means to me. 
PAM: ...Would You Rather? 
PAM: : Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail? 
PAM: : I'm going into labor! 
PAM: 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye.   It really makes us look unprofessional. 
PAM: 1-8-5-0-5. 
PAM: 20 past 5. 
PAM: 250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan. 
PAM: 47, 48, 49! Jim wins! 
PAM: 49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition. 
PAM: 70? How many do you type? 
PAM: A baby. 
PAM: A celebrity sex tape. 
PAM: A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything s in order. 
PAM: A dog-like obedience to authority 
PAM: A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb. 
PAM: A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that? 
PAM: A guarantee of what? 
PAM: A homeless person. Really? A homeless person. 
PAM: A little different. What time is it there? 
PAM: A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it? 
PAM: A little. 
PAM: A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind. 
PAM: A piece of paper. 
PAM: A ski mask and a swimsuit. 
PAM: A suit? 
PAM: A world where you truly can be anything you want. 
PAM: About 2 months 
PAM: About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned. 
PAM: About ten? 
PAM: About when you want to give me more of your money? 
PAM: Absolutely!  
PAM: Absolutely, I do. 
PAM: Absolutely, it's awesome-- 
PAM: Absolutely.  
PAM: Absolutely.  
PAM: Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it. 
PAM: Actually, I have it. 
PAM: Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair. 
PAM: Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow. 
PAM: Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the... 
PAM: Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it. 
PAM: Admit what? 
PAM: After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so  thank you. 
PAM: After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment. 
PAM: Again, no pants. 
PAM: Agreed. But that's all, okay. 
PAM: Ah! 
PAM: Ah, no, it passed. It's good. 
PAM: Ah, see, was that so hard? 
PAM: Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great.  Right? 
PAM: Ah. 
PAM: Ah. 
PAM: Ah. 
PAM: Ah. Ahh.  
PAM: Aha. How s Athlead? 
PAM: Ah-ha. 
PAM: All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly. 
PAM: All right, see you later... 
PAM: All right, what'd you do? 
PAM: All right, you don t have to. 
PAM: All right. Cool, well... thanks. Graphics 
PAM: All right. I did not come back here just to see you. 
PAM: All right. You can go. Give him his gum. 
PAM: All time favorite. 
PAM: Almost. 
PAM: Alright  
PAM: Alright! 
PAM: Alright, have a good trip. 
PAM: Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room. 
PAM: Alright, just call me after the doctor. 
PAM: Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault. 
PAM: Alright. 
PAM: Also, Pam and Roy. 
PAM: Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America. 
PAM: Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company.  Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby. 
PAM: Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control. 
PAM: An alliance? 
PAM: An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon? 
PAM: An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten. 
PAM: And a soy sauce packet. 
PAM: And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor. 
PAM: And brush our teeth. 
PAM: And do my job? 
PAM: And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids. 
PAM: And dumping her on her birthday. 
PAM: And Dwight would be like- 
PAM: And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office. 
PAM: And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too. 
PAM: And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so... 
PAM: And his favorite lunch. 
PAM: And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell. 
PAM: And I have my original.   
PAM: And I'll just watch him. Keena 
PAM: And it is so cute how she signs her name. 
PAM: And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way. 
PAM: And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We ll come back to visit. But I think it s time for us to officially  
PAM: And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence. 
PAM: And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please? 
PAM: And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much. 
PAM: And now you guys are dating? 
PAM: And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right? 
PAM: And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in. 
PAM: And that is... 
PAM: And that was fun. But what about a year from now? 
PAM: And that was our summer. 
PAM: And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales. 
PAM: And the clown? 
PAM: And the fear. 
PAM: And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting... 
PAM: And then my handsome husband... 
PAM: And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids? 
PAM: And then you stopped at the bar on the way back? 
PAM: And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one. 
PAM: And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer? 
PAM: And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about. 
PAM: And Tom... 
PAM: And uh, I'll look into those. Graphics 
PAM: And very expensive. 
PAM: And we have homework. 
PAM: And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song. 
PAM: And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France. 
PAM: And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up. 
PAM: And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area. 
PAM: And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y. 
PAM: And we're also supposed to speak our truths. 
PAM: And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group. 
PAM: And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in. 
PAM: And you thought you guys were millionaires. 
PAM: And you will eat whatever is fanciest? 
PAM: And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!! 
PAM: And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you. 
PAM: And, I'm freaking out. 
PAM: And, poof! He disappears.  
PAM: And... 
PAM: Andy that's way too personal of a question. 
PAM: Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night? 
PAM: Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours. 
PAM: Andy, somebody defaced it. 
PAM: Andy, this is the deal we made. 
PAM: Andy, why should she have your crappy computer? 
PAM: Andy. 
PAM: Andy's family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman. 
PAM: Angela as the nurse! 
PAM: Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed. 
PAM: Angela is such a liar! 
PAM: Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard. 
PAM: Angela, I want to talk to you about something. 
PAM: Angela, I'm sorry. 
PAM: Angela, that s pretty transparently me. 
PAM: Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now. 
PAM: Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time. 
PAM: Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job. 
PAM: Angela. 
PAM: Angela? 
PAM: Angela? 
PAM: Anyone want to see the video from Cece s recital? 
PAM: Anything to get out of that office. 
PAM: Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in. 
PAM: Anyway, um... I miss you. 
PAM: Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes. 
PAM: Are you asleep? 
PAM: Are you avoiding your phone call? 
PAM: Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday? 
PAM: Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue? 
PAM: Are you good? 
PAM: Are you happy? 
PAM: Are you inching away from me? 
PAM: Are you kidding me? 
PAM: Are you okay, Kevin?  
PAM: Are you okay, what's wrong? 
PAM: Are you okay? 
PAM: Are you okay? 
PAM: Are you proposing!? 
PAM: Are you pushing me off the phone? 
PAM: Are you ready? 
PAM: Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks? 
PAM: Are you sad that Dwight beat you? 
PAM: Are you serious? 
PAM: Are you serious? 
PAM: Are you serious? 
PAM: Are you sure you don't want to play? 
PAM: Are you sure? 
PAM: Are you-- Twice! For real? 
PAM: Are you wearing anything under the robe? 
PAM: As a human being. 
PAM: At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you. 
PAM: At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet. 
PAM: Austin? Maybe. 
PAM: Australia? I have always wanted to go there? 
PAM: Automatic voicemail. 
PAM: Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny "Jim" game. 
PAM: Aw! 
PAM: Aw! That's great Toby. 
PAM: Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet. 
PAM: Aw, I missed you. 
PAM: Aw, that's so sweet!  
PAM: Aw, we're doing it. 
PAM: Aw. 
PAM: Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too. 
PAM: Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it. 
PAM: Awesome. 
PAM: Aww-- 
PAM: Aww, my hero! 
PAM: Aww. 
PAM: Aww. 
PAM: Awwh, you're welcome.  My pleasure. 
PAM: Ayyyy! 
PAM: Baby. Tattoo 
PAM: Back off, Dwight.   Hyuh!   What? 
PAM: Barf! Ugh, you suck! 
PAM: Basically I couldn t tell, but I think... 
PAM: Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit. 
PAM: Beat. 
PAM: Because everything makes me cry, so what s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone. 
PAM: Because he accomplished something. 
PAM: Because he just loves me too much. 
PAM: Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box. 
PAM: Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home... 
PAM: Because I m so glad you re back, baby, but I m just I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you re giving up so much. 
PAM: Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy. 
PAM: Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy. 
PAM: Because of the flowers. 
PAM: Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you. 
PAM: Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny. 
PAM: Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times. 
PAM: Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too. 
PAM: Because we're usually not on the same page. 
PAM: Because you're very important? 
PAM: Because, she didn't send it to you! 
PAM: Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good. 
PAM: Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that... 
PAM: Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons? Ben 
PAM: Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed. 
PAM: Big day. 
PAM: Bill Bourbon was my uncle. I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug. 
PAM: Boo! 
PAM: Bottle of rum it is.  Alright, shall we? 
PAM: Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!! 
PAM: Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and... 
PAM: Brian? 
PAM: Brilliant! 
PAM: Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun. 
PAM: Buddha who? 
PAM: But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him. 
PAM: But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like a lot of them? Ben 
PAM: But have you ever actually seen him yourself? 
PAM: But I don't think I am. 
PAM: But I really think you should reconsider. 
PAM: But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up. 
PAM: But I'm not kidding. I really want to do it. 
PAM: But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair. 
PAM: But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them. 
PAM: But it's not until next month. 
PAM: But I've learned to love again.  He's a cartoon sailor. 
PAM: But not everyone... 
PAM: But not to us. 
PAM: But of course! 
PAM: But sometimes he talks about flesh  and bacchanals. 
PAM: But that doesn't sound good. 
PAM: But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions? 
PAM: But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better. Ryan and 
PAM: But then I moved it. Pam's 
PAM: But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do. 
PAM: But these were not the kind of people who use their words. 
PAM: But you can't today, we're doing inventory. 
PAM: But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line. 
PAM: But, Kevin that's... 
PAM: But, no, but we are a family. 
PAM: But... 
PAM: Bye Jim. 
PAM: Bye! Hey. 
PAM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye.  
PAM: Bye.  
PAM: Bye.  
PAM: Bye. Call me when you land. 
PAM: Cakes really good. 
PAM: Called 'Impressions.' 
PAM: Can I help you, Michael? 
PAM: Can I talk to you a second? 
PAM: Can I turn on the radio? 
PAM: Can we take a look at the suite now? Front Desk 
PAM: Can you actually fire people? 
PAM: Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael. Young 
PAM: Can you believe that... 
PAM: Can you believe who Trump fired? 
PAM: Can you come here please? 
PAM: Can you give us another minute please? 
PAM: Can you go instead? 
PAM: Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not? 
PAM: Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous? 
PAM: Can't back out now, Halpert. 
PAM: Can't stay there all day. 
PAM: Can't your other cats keep her company. 
PAM: Carol Stills. 
PAM: Carol, you're on with Michael. 
PAM: 'Cause Roy's got a truck. 
PAM: 'Cause there's someone already here named Pam. 
PAM: Cause they're just stupid. 
PAM: Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier. 
PAM: Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night. 
PAM: Cecelia. 
PAM: Cece's getting christened today. 
PAM: Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer. 
PAM: Certainly.  Okay, clear. 
PAM: Certainly. Um  you dropped your cell phone. 
PAM: Cheers. 
PAM: Chet ...something. 
PAM: Clark? 
PAM: Come down and... open it and you'll see. 
PAM: Come here. 
PAM: Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do! 
PAM: Come on Angela, don't you have a game? 
PAM: Come on! Ryan! 
PAM: Come on, it won't be that bad. 
PAM: Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert. 
PAM: Come on, it'll take two seconds. 
PAM: Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor. 
PAM: Come on, Michael! Yeah! 
PAM: Come on. 
PAM: Come on. 
PAM: Come on. Tell me. 
PAM: Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton? 
PAM: Congratulations! 
PAM: Congratulations. 
PAM: Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre.  
PAM: Cool, are you coming back to say hi? 
PAM: Cool. 
PAM: Cool. 
PAM: Cool. 
PAM: Cool. 
PAM: Cool... This is your desk. 
PAM: Corporate greed? 
PAM: Could he still be seeing her? 
PAM: Could you practice on the forms? 
PAM: Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours? 
PAM: Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down. 
PAM: Cut it out. 
PAM: Cut. 
PAM: Cut. 
PAM: Cut. That was your best apology video ever. 
PAM: Cute. 
PAM: Cute.  Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good. 
PAM: Da-das. 
PAM: Darn it. 
PAM: Darryl, hey. 
PAM: Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time. 
PAM: David Wallace is on line one. 
PAM: David, what are you doing here? 
PAM: Definitely. 
PAM: Definitely. 
PAM: Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon? 
PAM: Did a good job, Buddy. Now it s time to come home. 
PAM: Did everybody end up investing ten thousand? 
PAM: Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into. 
PAM: Did I? Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious. 
PAM: Did it help? 
PAM: Did somebody call Hank? 
PAM: Did you actually try your hardest? 
PAM: Did you do something to her? 
PAM: Did you end up investing? 
PAM: Did you find anything good in your desk? 
PAM: Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael? 
PAM: Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks. 
PAM: Did you lose Cece? 
PAM: Did you prank Dwight? 
PAM: Did you see him at a bathhouse? 
PAM: Did you sleep in cabins? 
PAM: Did you talk to him? 
PAM: Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight. 
PAM: Did... Karen get the job? 
PAM: Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis? Ben 
PAM: Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped. 
PAM: Dizzy Gillespie. 
PAM: Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy? 
PAM: Do it! 
PAM: Do Not Resuscitate  
PAM: Do we know anyone who was in the accident? 
PAM: Do you drink this every day? 
PAM: Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here. 
PAM: Do you have any leads on a job? 
PAM: Do you have it with you? 
PAM: Do you have something in your pocket? 
PAM: Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica. 
PAM: Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral? 
PAM: Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys? 
PAM: Do you mind? 
PAM: Do you think it's a good idea? 
PAM: Do you think Michael and Jan actually... 
PAM: Do you think that they're like- 
PAM: Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card? 
PAM: Do you think they dined and dashed? 
PAM: Do you think you could work from this?  we made some small adjustments. Tattoo

PAM: Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later?   
PAM: Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about? 
PAM: Doesn't feel right. 
PAM: Doesn't Jan have money?

PAM: Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute. 
PAM: Don't we all? 
PAM: Don't yell! 
PAM: Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time? 
PAM: Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one? 
PAM: Don't you think you should say something? 
PAM: Don't, don't-- 
PAM: Don't. 
PAM: Don't... get... on. Do not. 
PAM: Down. You have to sit down so I can get the full effect. 
PAM: Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.

PAM: Dwight is about to get so Pammed. 
PAM: Dwight just listen! It's underneath...  
PAM: Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness. 
PAM: Dwight take it down.

PAM: Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo. 
PAM: Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly. 
PAM: Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you? 
PAM: Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number. 
PAM: Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously. 
PAM: Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog? 
PAM: Dwight, what are you--- 
PAM: Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds! 
PAM: Dwight, what are you doing?

PAM: Erin, you don t need to call him that. 
PAM: Erin. 
PAM: Even if she's not getting anything? 
PAM: Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him. 
PAM: Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes. 
PAM: Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that. 
PAM: Everyone, can I have your attention. This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right?   
PAM: Everyone, Let s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just I kind of meant just everybody from the office. 
PAM: Everyone's waiting in the conference room. 
PAM: Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay? 
PAM: Everything okay? 
PAM: Everything's fine. We have plenty of time. 
PAM: Exactly the way it is. 
PAM: Exactly. 
PAM: Exactly. 
PAM: Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are. 
PAM: Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course. 
PAM: Excellent, thanks. 
PAM: Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates. 
PAM: Excuse me. 
PAM: Fail. I don't want to fail... again. 
PAM: Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you 
PAM: False alarm. 
PAM: Find someone else, I don t know. Ask Phyllis. 
PAM: Fine work! Fine work Stanley! 
PAM: Fine!   Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
PAM: Fine. 
PAM: Five bucks if you can get him to admit it. 
PAM: Five minutes apart.

PAM: For real, you're not kidding? 
PAM: For the bugs. 
PAM: For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.  
PAM: For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better. 
PAM: For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it. 
PAM: For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great. 
PAM: For what it's worth, I liked your party better. 
PAM: Forget about my mural. It's stupid. 
PAM: Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It s so great to see you. 
PAM: Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.

PAM: Guess what? 
PAM: Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design. 
PAM: Guys, I don't like this analogy.

PAM: Have you? 
PAM: He brought a sled. 
PAM: He can be. 
PAM: He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day. 
PAM: He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right? 
PAM: He didn't leave me. He just went part time.  Can you just fill out the form please?

PAM: Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom. 
PAM: Here's what I was 
PAM: Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops. 
PAM: He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character. 
PAM: He's a gun nut. 
PAM: He's a purple belt. That's really high. 
PAM: He's from that company in Pitts... 
PAM: He's going through a break-up. 
PAM: He's gonna be disappointed. 
PAM: He's in a box? 
PAM: He's more, just... like... you can go. 
PAM: He's nice and he seems interested. 
PAM: He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone. 
PAM: He's not here. I don't know where he is. 
PAM: He's not saying what he needs to say. 
PAM: He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly. 
PAM: He's really making you work for it, huh? 
PAM: He's seriously awful! 
PAM: He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird. 
PAM: Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us? 
PAM: Hey Brian, you got a sec? 
PAM: Hey Cathy. 
PAM: Hey Charles. 
PAM: Hey Charles.

The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine! 
PAM: Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me? 
PAM: Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK. 
PAM: Hey, Good luck. 
PAM: Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him? 
PAM: Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.

PAM: Hey, um, can I ask you a question? 
PAM: Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla.  She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume. 
PAM: Hey, what are you doing here? 
PAM: Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want? 
PAM: Hey, what's up? 
PAM: Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you. 
PAM: Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately? 
PAM: Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out? 
PAM: Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel. 
PAM: Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.

PAM: Hmm, I don't, know... 
PAM: Hmm. 
PAM: Hmm. 
PAM: Hmm. 
PAM: Hmm. 
PAM: Hmm. 
PAM: Hmm. 
PAM: Hmm. I think Jim s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy. 
PAM: Hmm... 
PAM: Hmm... 
PAM: Hmm... yeah. Listen Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a pretty big risk. 
PAM: Hmm? 
PAM: Hmm? 
PAM: Hmm? 
PAM: Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing. 
PAM: Hmm-mm. 
PAM: Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao. 
PAM: Hold on a second.  Wait, what did you just say? 
PAM: Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet. 
PAM: Holy s*** is that real? 
PAM: Home run Michael. 
PAM: Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren t gonna make it. 
PAM: Honestly, I think you should go easy on her. 
PAM: Honesty is very important to me. 
PAM: Honey, no. 
PAM: Hot fudge? 
PAM: Hot tie guy. 
PAM: How  bout we wait til next year after you have your kid? 
PAM: How about a little visit? 
PAM: How about for dating my mom? 
PAM: How about green? 
PAM: How about the anchor? 
PAM: How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays? 
PAM: How am I supposed to... get... 
PAM: How are you Tom. Nice to see you. 
PAM: How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear. 
PAM: How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us? 
PAM: How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you! 
PAM: How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that? 
PAM: How could we do what?  
PAM: How did he use it again? 
PAM: How did you know? 
PAM: How do you come back from that? 
PAM: How do you figure? 
PAM: How does one do that? 
PAM: How far away does she live now, like ten minutes? 
PAM: How is it going? 
PAM: How is that better than a barbecue? 
PAM: How is this on me? 
PAM: How long will that take? 
PAM: How much did you give him? 
PAM: How much stuff you got. 
PAM: How much? 
PAM: How much? 
PAM: How s it going? Everything make sense? 
PAM: How sure is this? 
PAM: How was Jamaica? 
PAM: How what? 
PAM: How would we know that? 
PAM: How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse? 
PAM: How'd it go? 
PAM: How'd the run go? 
PAM: How's it going down there? 
PAM: How's it going? 
PAM: How's it working? 
PAM: Huh. 
PAM: Huh. 
PAM: Huh.  Uh huh. 
PAM: Huh. What about Cathy? 
PAM: I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar. 
PAM: I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah. 
PAM: I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired. 
PAM: I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert! 
PAM: I am Dr. Cinderella. 
PAM: I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this. 
PAM: I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want. 
PAM: I am just following the website. 
PAM: I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming. 
PAM: I am not pr- 
PAM: I am working. 
PAM: I am. 
PAM: I am. You should come dance with us. 
PAM: I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, "That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best." 
PAM: I bet he went home. 
PAM: I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday.  
PAM: I bought my veil. 
PAM: I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad. 
PAM: I can do that. Graphics 
PAM: I can help you with that. 
PAM: I can sign for it. Delivery 
PAM: I can take 3 people. 
PAM: I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad. 
PAM: I cannot wait for that joke to be over. 
PAM: I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby. 
PAM: I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan. 
PAM: I can't believe that's not working. 
PAM: I can't believe this is actually happening. 
PAM: I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me. 
PAM: I can't do this. 
PAM: I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok. 
PAM: I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle. 
PAM: I can't even talk about it. 
PAM: I can't find my glasses. 
PAM: I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies. 
PAM: I can't hear anything! 
PAM: I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going- 
PAM: I can't see them when they're on the floor 
PAM: I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right. 
PAM: I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over. 
PAM: I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault. 
PAM: I could get us a complaint. 
PAM: I could give you some beginner stickies? 
PAM: I could read it. 
PAM: I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael. 
PAM: I could work here. I could see this. 
PAM: I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean? 
PAM: I definitely remember your dinner party. 
PAM: I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors. Which feels... 
PAM: I did not know that. 
PAM: I did! 
PAM: I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like "gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why." 
PAM: I did? 
PAM: I did? 
PAM: I didn t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I m a tragic person. I m really happy now. But it would just just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself  be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn t that long.  
PAM: I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended. 
PAM: I didn't see you! You should have yelled  Crossing!  
PAM: I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress. 
PAM: I do not. 
PAM: I do. 
PAM: I don t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out. 
PAM: I don t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there. 
PAM: I don t think I should. 
PAM: I don t think you guys understand why we re doing this. It s- 
PAM: I don't- 
PAM: I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here.  I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian. 
PAM: I don't get it. 
PAM: I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks. Todd 
PAM: I don't have my contacts... 
PAM: I don't know any of those. Graphics 
PAM: I don't know anything about that. Police Officer 
PAM: I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is... 
PAM: I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun. 
PAM: I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art. 
PAM: I don't know if there's really a private place in this office. 
PAM: I don't know I'm really committed to winning. 
PAM: I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person! 
PAM: I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost. 
PAM: I don't know who he is. 
PAM: I don't know!  
PAM: I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital! 
PAM: I don't know, but it's interesting right? 
PAM: I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet. 
PAM: I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack. 
PAM: I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight... 
PAM: I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what , that one... 
PAM: I don't know. 
PAM: I don't know. 
PAM: I don't know. 
PAM: I don't know. 
PAM: I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything. 
PAM: I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff. 
PAM: I don't know. I'm just hungry. 
PAM: I don't know. It felt far. 
PAM: I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to. 
PAM: I don't know. That usually works. 
PAM: I don't know. They're still in there. 
PAM: I don't need to know. 
PAM: I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year.  Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things. 
PAM: I don't really have any control over that Stanley. 
PAM: I don't really think we need... 
PAM: I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension. 
PAM: I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines. 
PAM: I don't think anyone thought that. 
PAM: I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace. 
PAM: I don't think I'm gonna make it. 
PAM: I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good. 
PAM: I don't think Jim cares about his hair. 
PAM: I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her. 
PAM: I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance. 
PAM: I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So... 
PAM: I don't think so. 
PAM: I don't think so. 
PAM: I don't think that's a good idea. 
PAM: I don't think that's a word. 
PAM: I don't think those were yours to take. 
PAM: I don't think we really need that, Michael. 
PAM: I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash. 
PAM: I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction. 
PAM: I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music 
PAM: I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight. 
PAM: I don't understand the question. 
PAM: I don't wanna guess. 
PAM: I don't want to have my baby here. 
PAM: I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day. 
PAM: I don't, I don't think we sh- 
PAM: I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it. 
PAM: I feel awful. 
PAM: I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall. 
PAM: I feel good.   Wow. 
PAM: I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right. 
PAM: I feel like --Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem. 
PAM: I feel like he s always making these decisions for the family, and then I m left playing catch-up. 
PAM: I feel like its-- 
PAM: I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her. 
PAM: I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but... 
PAM: I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing  
PAM: I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe. 
PAM: I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you. 
PAM: I flipped through it. 
PAM: I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one. 
PAM: I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car. 
PAM: I get paid $40,000 per year. 
PAM: I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very... 
PAM: I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one!  Right? 
PAM: I got goose bumps. 
PAM: I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched. 
PAM: I got it. 
PAM: I got this. 
PAM: I gotcha one.  
PAM: I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood. 
PAM: I guess that's why we have a temp, huh? 
PAM: I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better. 
PAM: I guess you gotta move to Philly after all. 
PAM: I guess, yeah. 
PAM: I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it. 
PAM: I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day. 
PAM: I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so... 
PAM: I hate you. 
PAM: I hate you. 
PAM: I have 59 voicemails. 
PAM: I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone. 
PAM: I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  
PAM: I have an early lunch. 
PAM: I have an important question for you. 
PAM: I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica. 
PAM: I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy. 
PAM: I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship.   Hey! You look great!   Let's go! 
PAM: I have everything. 
PAM: I have it covered.  
PAM: I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever. 
PAM: I have one idea of what it means. 
PAM: I have one kitchen. 
PAM: I have so many people to thank for this award.  
PAM: I have some faxes to get out. 
PAM: I have the lowest sales record of anyone here. 
PAM: I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day? 
PAM: I have the worst attitude of any person here. 
PAM: I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?! 
PAM: I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. 
PAM: I have to stay and retake it. 
PAM: I haven t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he s always like,  Beesly!  I love that. Only thing better than getting the job--  Beesly!   
PAM: I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally---  
PAM: I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen. 
PAM: I hope so. 
PAM: I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that.  
PAM: I-- I thought they were confused at least... 
PAM: I just answer the phone. 
PAM: I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it. 
PAM: I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess. 
PAM: I just feel kind of tired, you know. 
PAM: I just had a baby. 
PAM: I just have a quick question. 
PAM: I just helped someone out. It feels good. 
PAM: I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this? 
PAM: I just knew. 
PAM: I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy? 
PAM: I just think somebody lost the paperwork. 
PAM: I just want to say goodbye ok? 
PAM: I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!! 
PAM: I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while. 
PAM: I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow. 
PAM: I just wanted to see you! 
PAM: I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that. Lab 
PAM: I kind of am. It s crazy. 
PAM: I kind of doubt Gabe has suit. 
PAM: I kind of forced you to do it. 
PAM: I kind of thought something would happen tonight too. 
PAM: I knew it. 
PAM: I knew some of it. 
PAM: I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat. 
PAM: I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say,  Bye, Daddy.  
PAM: I know how to throw a football. 
PAM: I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary. 
PAM: I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover? 
PAM: I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy. 
PAM: I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs. 
PAM: I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone. 
PAM: I know you Michael, I saw you naked. 
PAM: I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back. 
PAM: I know! 
PAM: I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff. 
PAM: I know, because you're the reason we're moving. 
PAM: I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do. 
PAM: I know, can you believe it? 
PAM: I know, right? 
PAM: I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things. 
PAM: I know, you don't like to be frazzled. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. 
PAM: I know. Ben 
PAM: I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life. 
PAM: I know. I don't care. 
PAM: I know. I saw that. 
PAM: I know. If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now.   
PAM: I know. Isn't that always how it goes? 
PAM: I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this. 
PAM: I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out. 
PAM: I know. Now you don't have to. 
PAM: I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video. 
PAM: I know. You miss Angela, don't you? 
PAM: I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, "Absolutely, I do." 
PAM: I lied about some aspects of the building. 
PAM: I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to. 
PAM: I like cheesy. 
PAM: I like her. 
PAM: I like it so far. 
PAM: I like it. 
PAM: I like that one. 
PAM: I like that one. 
PAM: I like to paint. 
PAM: I like working here. 
PAM: I liked them. 
PAM: I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here. 
PAM: I ll come visit you. 
PAM: I love ... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely.  
PAM: I love it, conservation. Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.  No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings!  
PAM: I love it. 
PAM: I love it. 
PAM: I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever. Pam's 
PAM: I love these. 
PAM: I love to watch him dance. 
PAM: I love you so much.  
PAM: I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own. 
PAM: I love you. 
PAM: I love you. 
PAM: I love you. 
PAM: I m afraid that you re gonna resent me and I m afraid that  
PAM: I m an oncologist and you are a dog. 
PAM: I m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it s like a double date. 
PAM: I m doing it for us. 
PAM: I m good. 
PAM: I m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She s obviously super cute I get it. But I d like to point out there s 50 pounds more of me to love if that s your thing. 
PAM: I m so sorry. 
PAM: I m so sorry. 
PAM: I m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don t want him to do it anymore, and I don t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly. 
PAM: I m training a temp to be my replacement while I m on maternity leave. Oh I should ve mentioned I m pregnant. You probably didn t notice because it s impossible to tell I m so small. But yeah I m pregnant.  Oh come on! 
PAM: I made a sale! 
PAM: I made brownies. 
PAM: I made something for our closing ceremonies. 
PAM: I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet. 
PAM: I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So... 
PAM: I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or... 
PAM: I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader? 
PAM: I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me something for Valentine's Day. 
PAM: I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there. 
PAM: I mean, we ve having issues. It can t hurt to talk about them, right? 
PAM: I mean, what the hell was that? 
PAM: I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about. 
PAM: I mean, yeah. 
PAM: I mean, you bought me a house! 
PAM: I meant to say something earlier. I just... 
PAM: I might go to the mall. 
PAM: I missed you too.   
PAM: I move we sell! 
PAM: I need new shoes. 
PAM: I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant. 
PAM: I need to get out of this dress. 
PAM: I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna... 
PAM: I now find you repulsive. 
PAM: I only brought the one. 
PAM: I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one. 
PAM: I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know. 
PAM: I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked. 
PAM: I really doubt it, Michael. 
PAM: I really hope you get the job. 
PAM: I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and... 
PAM: I really think you should reconsider. 
PAM: I really want to do this! 
PAM: I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome. 
PAM: I reminded you last night. 
PAM: I said happy birthday. 
PAM: I said it normal. 
PAM: I saw a ghost. 
PAM: I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing! Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it! 
PAM: I saw you were getting along with Ryan again. 
PAM: I should go. 
PAM: I should just go.  Where to now Caleb? 
PAM: I should probably get back to work. 
PAM: I should probably get back to... 
PAM: I should really get going. 
PAM: I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over. 
PAM: I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't. 
PAM: I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight. 
PAM: I still can't believe he didn't tell me. 
PAM: I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever.  Hey, babe, how are you? 
PAM: I stole Nellie s phone. 
PAM: I take it back! 
PAM: I take it back. 
PAM: I think he meant personal day. 
PAM: I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer.  Michael and 
PAM: I think he's just making her laugh. 
PAM: I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza. 
PAM: I think it s good. He likes fishing. 
PAM: I think it's called 'Nibbles'. Todd 
PAM: I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little. 
PAM: I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion.  And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention. 
PAM: I think I've got it. 
PAM: I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim. 
PAM: I think Michael may have snapped. 
PAM: I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.  
PAM: I think she looks good. Now that she s wearing sports bras, we don t see her boobs as much. 
PAM: I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders. 
PAM: I think so. Okay. 
PAM: I think that I should help him get home. 
PAM: I think that's champagne. 
PAM: I think the tree looks nice. 
PAM: I think there's better... 
PAM: I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units. 
PAM: I think we broke his brain.  
PAM: I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo... 
PAM: I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding. 
PAM: I think you need to go to Florida. 
PAM: I think you should get dressed. 
PAM: I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October. 
PAM: I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but... 
PAM: I think... you're a witch. 
PAM: I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician. 
PAM: I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas? 
PAM: I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn t that kind of the point?
PAM: I thought that was your corner. 
PAM: I thought we were having a nice time. 
PAM: I thought we were just having fun at the beach. 
PAM: I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number? 
PAM: I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so .. 
PAM: I type 90. 
PAM: I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too. 
PAM: I used a variation of your move. 
PAM: I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like,  Who s that receptionist? I like her.  Now I m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you re like,  Oh, loser.  
PAM: I ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here s where we stand with the chore wheel.  We ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it s more fun this way. 
PAM: I wanna do this. 
PAM: I want her to meet Michael. 
PAM: I want the iPod. 
PAM: I want to handle it. 
PAM: I want to hit you. 
PAM: I want to hit you. I'll do that. 
PAM: I want us to make it. I want a fresh start. 
PAM: I want you to be Grandma. 
PAM: I was after your money. 
PAM: I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need? 
PAM: I was helping Nellie drive  
PAM: I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car. 
PAM: I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe. 
PAM: I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit. 
PAM: I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have? Graphics 
PAM: I was planning on it. 
PAM: I was thinking that we... 
PAM: I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers. 
PAM: I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know. 
PAM: I went out to look for a better office space. 
PAM: I will? 
PAM: I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way. 
PAM: I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up. 
PAM: I wished, right? 
PAM: I won. 
PAM: I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'. 
PAM: I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide. 
PAM: I would like it off my desk. 
PAM: I would love to meet Long Tim. 
PAM: I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here! 
PAM: I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move. 
PAM: I... 
PAM: I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right? 
PAM: I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay. 
PAM: I'd like to try it. 
PAM: I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it. 
PAM: If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do. 
PAM: If he comes out, distract him.  
PAM: If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back. 
PAM: If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week. 
PAM: If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss. 
PAM: If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors. 
PAM: If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day. 
PAM: If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no. 
PAM: If you re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea that you can t please everybody all the time. 
PAM: If you sit in the back. 
PAM: If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious. 
PAM: If you wanna do something for the funeral... 
PAM: If you would have asked me that, then you would know.  
PAM: If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong. 
PAM: I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque. 
PAM: I'll get it right away. 
PAM: I'll go.  My name is Deborah U. Tante. Deb for short. 
PAM: I'll have one. 
PAM: I'll just get a ride home from Angela. 
PAM: I'll just stand here? 
PAM: I'll leave a message. 
PAM: I'll make the call. 
PAM: I'll probably just wear this. 
PAM: I'll see you tomorrow. 
PAM: I'll take the iPod. 
PAM: I'm a woman. I would want to know. 
PAM: I'm all over it. 
PAM: I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did. 
PAM: I'm bored. 
PAM: I'm cold. Captain 
PAM: I'm coming back the wrong way.   It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it.   Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it? 
PAM: I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?' 
PAM: I'm confused... 
PAM: I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural? 
PAM: I'm engaged. So... 
PAM: I'm freezing. 
PAM: I'm full on corrupt! 
PAM: I'm full. 
PAM: I'm going into labor! 
PAM: I'm going into labor. 
PAM: I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight. 
PAM: I'm going to say it anyway. 
PAM: I'm going with him. 
PAM: I'm going. 
PAM: I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right? 
PAM: I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please. 
PAM: I'm gonna return it. 
PAM: I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office. 
PAM: I'm good. 
PAM: I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts. 
PAM: I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am.  That's Popeye. 
PAM: I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor. 
PAM: I'm here. I'm a part of this now. 
PAM: I'm in the wrong class... 
PAM: I'm inventing new diseases. 
PAM: I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day. 
PAM: I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable. 
PAM: I'm just making conversation. 
PAM: I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe. 
PAM: I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel. 
PAM: I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier. 
PAM: I'm missing my scarf. Oh.  
PAM: I'm more of a dog person. 
PAM: I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. 
PAM: I'm not apologizing to anyone. Michael owes me an apology. 
PAM: I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive? 
PAM: I'm not freaking out, Andy. 
PAM: I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick. 
PAM: I'm not going inside. 
PAM: I'm not going to do that. 
PAM: I'm not gonna do that. 
PAM: I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim. 
PAM: I'm not gonna lie to her, either. 
PAM: I'm not into Jim. Yeah. 
PAM: I'm not making any copies. 
PAM: I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt. 
PAM: I'm not... I'm not going to have... 
PAM: I'm on it. 
PAM: I'm on the phone. 
PAM: I'm Pam Halpert. 
PAM: I'm Pam. 
PAM: I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work. 
PAM: I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy. 
PAM: I'm really in labor! This is happening! 
PAM: I'm rejecting your... 
PAM: I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch. 
PAM: I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face. 
PAM: I'm serious, take it down or else. 
PAM: I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came. 
PAM: I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this. 
PAM: I'm so sorry, Michael. 
PAM: I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility. 
PAM: I'm so sorry. 
PAM: I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager. 
PAM: I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related. 
PAM: I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices. 
PAM: I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to. 
PAM: I'm sorry, he's not in right now. Phone 
PAM: I'm sorry, he's not usually like that. 
PAM: I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry. 
PAM: I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible? 
PAM: I'm sorry. 
PAM: I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue- 
PAM: I'm sorry. I had no idea. 
PAM: I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there s something Jim isn't telling me. 
PAM: I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room? 
PAM: I'm still having a nice day. 
PAM: I'm still not sure why this woman is even here. 
PAM: I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on. 
PAM: I'm sure it was really lovely. 
PAM: I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt. 
PAM: I'm sure no one asked you to do that. 
PAM: I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens. 
PAM: I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo. 
PAM: I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties. 
PAM: I'm thinking cow- 
PAM: I'm uh, I'm dating Jim. 
PAM: I'm working on it Kev. 
PAM: In costumes! 
PAM: In English, box of paper snowshoe racing. 
PAM: In his office. You can go right in. 
PAM: In my sleep. 
PAM: In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams.  Do we know everything about each other? 
PAM: Irrigation. 
PAM: Is everything okay? 
PAM: Is he ok? 
PAM: Is he puffing out his chest? 
PAM: Is it a good message or a bad message? 
PAM: Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something? 
PAM: Is it called Ghostbusters? 
PAM: Is it for the bird? 
PAM: Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny.  I think my water just broke! 
PAM: Is it me? Is it Nellie? 
PAM: Is it, is it fake? 
PAM: Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica?  
PAM: Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton. 
PAM: Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he? 
PAM: Is that the police? 
PAM: Is that them again? 
PAM: Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings? 
PAM: Is that what 'soon' means to you? 
PAM: Is there a volume knob on that thing? 
PAM: Is there anything I can do? 
PAM: Is there more wine in the kitchen? 
PAM: Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit? 
PAM: Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom? 
PAM: Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible.  oh look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!" That's the first time I've seen it in writing! 
PAM: Is...? 
PAM: It all happened so fast. 
PAM: It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, "I will when you lose the baby weight." 
PAM: It costs about $75 per person. 
PAM: It costs seventy five dollars. 
PAM: It didn t look like that. 
PAM: It doesn't really seem like you. 
PAM: It hardly looks fake. It's so lush. 
PAM: It has the birth song on it! 
PAM: It is a screenplay. Starring himself. 
PAM: It is not that. Kevin! Oh! 
PAM: It is... her birthday. 
PAM: It just-  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh... 
PAM: It means grandmother. 
PAM: It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are. 
PAM: It really was. 
PAM: It s all yours. 
PAM: It s getting tougher. I just didn t know that it was gonna be this hard. 
PAM: It s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam s desk huh? 
PAM: It s great. 
PAM: It s huge. How much does it weigh? 
PAM: It s nice to have you back. 
PAM: it s okay. You can sit in the annex. 
PAM: It s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing. 
PAM: It says  Lotto Pool , right on top.  
PAM: It says here you cater to the eldery. 
PAM: It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date. 
PAM: It was for a video. IT Tech 
PAM: It was great. 
PAM: It was me. 
PAM: It was really funny. 
PAM: It was two. 
PAM: It was, sweetie. Keena 
PAM: It wasn't so bad. 
PAM: It'll be ready soon. 
PAM: It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam." So, maybe that'll stop now. 
PAM: It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking. 
PAM: It's a miracle. She loves him. 
PAM: It's a nice tux. 
PAM: It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. 
PAM: It's actually... 
PAM: It's Alex. 
PAM: It's an epidemic. 
PAM: It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash? 
PAM: It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little. 
PAM: It's behind you. 
PAM: It's better, thanks. 
PAM: It's called being smart. 
PAM: It's Christmas. 
PAM: It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front. 
PAM: It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry. 
PAM: It's disgusting and demeaning. 
PAM: It's disgusting! 
PAM: It's fine. Erin, you're going to go. And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth. 
PAM: It's funny you bring that up because yes it is. 
PAM: It's getting kind of rowdy down there. 
PAM: It's gonna be fun. 
PAM: It's good to be home. 
PAM: It's good to have you back. 
PAM: It's hot in there. How's the naan? 
PAM: It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... . 
PAM: It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town. 
PAM: It's just hard to explain. 
PAM: It's just last year you... 
PAM: It's just office pranks. 
PAM: It's just out there, you... 
PAM: It's just so dumb.  But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft... 
PAM: It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment. 
PAM: It's just the Scranton Times... 
PAM: It's kind of an impoverished country. 
PAM: It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic. 
PAM: It's kind of serious. 
PAM: It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. Sooo...  If you guys see anything... ? 
PAM: It's lovely. 
PAM: It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off. 
PAM: It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with. 
PAM: It's nice to see you again, Dwight. 
PAM: It's nice. 
PAM: It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache. 
PAM: It's not Brian's fault. 
PAM: It's not sterile! 
PAM: It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin. 
PAM: It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see? 
PAM: It's not. 
PAM: It's ok. 
PAM: It's ok. I got it. 
PAM: It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest. 
PAM: It's okay, honey.  It's okay, it's okay. 
PAM: It's okay. 
PAM: It's okay. I'll see you at home. 
PAM: It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be.. 
PAM: It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida. 
PAM: It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect. 
PAM: It's Phyllis! 
PAM: It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday. 
PAM: It's really cool. 
PAM: It's really good to see you. 
PAM: It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals. 
PAM: It's really just a regular shaped cake. 
PAM: It's really nice. 
PAM: It's really sweet. 
PAM: It's still me. 
PAM: It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael. 
PAM: It's terrible. 
PAM: It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something. 
PAM: It's true. 
PAM: It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things. 
PAM: It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five. 
PAM: It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject. 
PAM: It's with Brian and Alyssa. 
PAM: I've been warned. 
PAM: I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good. 
PAM: I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody. 
PAM: I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together...  Oh my god!  Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts?  Huh? No way. No way! 
PAM: I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this. 
PAM: Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him? 
PAM: Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you. 
PAM: Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.  
PAM: Jan. 
PAM: Jan's on the phone for you. 
PAM: Jelly beans. 
PAM: Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that? 
PAM: Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again. 
PAM: Jim does a really good one. Do yours. 
PAM: Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical? 
PAM: Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise? 
PAM: Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone. 
PAM: Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding. 
PAM: Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real. 
PAM: Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um...  
PAM: Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is.  I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note. 
PAM: Jim uses a 6 pound ball. 
PAM: Jim! 
PAM: Jim!  
PAM: Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack. 
PAM: Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico s at 7:30. Fake 
PAM: Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions. 
PAM: Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it. 
PAM: Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times. 
PAM: Jim, that was most of our savings. 
PAM: Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton. 
PAM: Jim, we waited too long! 
PAM: Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us. 
PAM: Jim, what if we both lose our jobs? I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one. 
PAM: Jim, what? 
PAM: Jim, you have high blood pressure. 
PAM: Jim. 
PAM: Jim. 
PAM: Jim. 
PAM: Jim.  
PAM: Jim. Can I see you for a second? 
PAM: Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you.   But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground  .   All right. 
PAM: Jim... 
PAM: Jim... I am really... sorry. 
PAM: Jim? 
PAM: Jim? No. 
PAM: Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours. 
PAM: Jim's bedroom. 
PAM: Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family. 
PAM: Jim's in Scranton. 
PAM: Jim's just really passionate about Italian food. 
PAM: Jim's on to me. 
PAM: Jinx! Buy me a coke. 
PAM: Joe Montana! 
PAM: Johnny Depp.  
PAM: Julie laughs at everything. 
PAM: Just a few adjustments Tattoo 
PAM: Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world. 
PAM: Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich. 
PAM: Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on. 
PAM: Just checking in, how's it going? 
PAM: Just don't get back together with her. 
PAM: Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will. 
PAM: Just go home. It doesn't matter. 
PAM: Just keep it to yourself then. 
PAM: Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways. 
PAM: Just let me have... Oh. 
PAM: Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons. 
PAM: Just like now. 
PAM: Just listen. 
PAM: Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim. 
PAM: Just one. "This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book." 
PAM: Just sent it. 
PAM: Just tell me. 
PAM: Just terrible. And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get. 
PAM: Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke. 
PAM: Just trust me. 
PAM: Just, we'll just keep going. 
PAM: K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean? 
PAM: Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud? 
PAM: Kay, well, you had that interesting thing. 
PAM: Kay. 
PAM: Kay. 
PAM: Kelly Kapoor, yes. 
PAM: Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes. 
PAM: Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move? 
PAM: Kelly, calm down. 
PAM: Kevin! 
PAM: Kevin, at most you re saving a microscopic amount of time. 
PAM: Kevin, do you feel OK? 
PAM: Kevin, don't! Come on! 
PAM: Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right? 
PAM: Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet? 
PAM: Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world. 
PAM: Kevin, you're such a gourmand. 
PAM: Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin. 
PAM: Koreans. 
PAM: Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner. 
PAM: Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access. 
PAM: Last week Jim wasn t there, and they named the company Athlead. 
PAM: Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo. 
PAM: Learn to cook for one! 
PAM: Leave! 
PAM: Legends of the Fall? 
PAM: Let it go. 
PAM: Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me. 
PAM: Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office. 
PAM: Let s call him.  
PAM: Let's do this. 
PAM: Let's get our juice on. 
PAM: Let's go. Pick up a paddle. 
PAM: Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started.  
PAM: Let's just calm down. 
PAM: Let's just- let's go. 
PAM: Let's just see how we feel when we get there. 
PAM: Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times.  Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home. 
PAM: Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die. 
PAM: Life is Downton Abbey. 
PAM: Like how? Dyeing my hair blond? 
PAM: Like Michael Scott Paper Company? 
PAM: Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information. 
PAM: Like what? 
PAM: Like what? 
PAM: Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs? 
PAM: Like... a year. 
PAM: Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here! 
PAM: Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight? 
PAM: Listen, I know you really like Ryan-- 
PAM: Listen, um  I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it s better than a fairy tale. It s like a long book that you never want to end. And you re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it. Woman 
PAM: Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but- 
PAM: Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake. 
PAM: Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room. 
PAM: Look at this. 
PAM: Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion? 
PAM: Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair? 
PAM: Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before. 
PAM: Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go! 
PAM: Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God...  So good. 
PAM: Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time. 
PAM: Love you, mom. 
PAM: Love you. 
PAM: Love you. 
PAM: Love you. 
PAM: Lunch with a girl from my hall. 
PAM: Make time for romance! 
PAM: Man, Angela really had a hold on him.  Angela. 
PAM: Matt? 
PAM: Maybe $50,000. 
PAM: Maybe Angela would cheerlead. 
PAM: Maybe because you hated her present so much. 
PAM: Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers. 
PAM: Maybe I should go. 
PAM: Maybe I'm overreacting. 
PAM: Maybe it s a list of people he s gonna fire. 
PAM: Maybe it should come from a man. 
PAM: Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me. 
PAM: Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies. 
PAM: Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist. 
PAM: Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here. 
PAM: Maybe more. 
PAM: Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger. 
PAM: Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer. 
PAM: Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay. 
PAM: Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere. 
PAM: Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date. 
PAM: Maybe you could play a song on your recorder. 
PAM: Maybe you should call back? 
PAM: Maybe you should wait before you adopt. 
PAM: Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well. 
PAM: Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet. 
PAM: Maybe, I'm a little tired. 
PAM: Maybe. 
PAM: Maybe. 
PAM: Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other. 
PAM: Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with. 
PAM: Maybe. I mean... 
PAM: Maybe. One step at a time. 
PAM: Me too! 
PAM: Me too. ...I think we're just drunk. 
PAM: Me too... 
PAM: Medium rare. Thanks.  
PAM: Mema. 
PAM: Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning. 
PAM: Meredith, I am so sorry about today. 
PAM: Meredith, I am so sorry. 
PAM: Meredith...   Oh... so uh... G-44. It's not ready Kevin! 
PAM: Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here? 
PAM: Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in. 
PAM: Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays. 
PAM: Michael and Jan definitely made out. 
PAM: Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills. 
PAM: Michael has taped every Dundies awards and now, he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights. 
PAM: Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow. 
PAM: Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch. 
PAM: Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam. 
PAM: Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy.  Everything pointed to it being a comedy. 
PAM: Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these.  I really want it. 
PAM: Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm. 
PAM: Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why. 
PAM: Michael wants a strippergram? 
PAM: Michael we don't know what you're talking about... 
PAM: Michael! 
PAM: Michael! 
PAM: Michael! 
PAM: Michael!  
PAM: Michael! It's really good to see you. 
PAM: Michael! What's going on? 
PAM: Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles.  
PAM: Michael, Angela's cat died. 
PAM: Michael, are you alright? 
PAM: Michael, do not let your imagination run amok. 
PAM: Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control. 
PAM: Michael, do something! 
PAM: Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?! 
PAM: Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, "Are you sure Michael?" And you said "Pam! Pam! Pam!" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, "Don't worry, it's just allergies." Do you remember that? 
PAM: Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer. 
PAM: Michael, get off the floor! 
PAM: Michael, he made huge cuts. 
PAM: Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online. 
PAM: Michael, I have Jan on the line. 
PAM: Michael, I think that as the boss you should really--- 
PAM: Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you. 
PAM: Michael, I...  I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something? 
PAM: Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him. 
PAM: Michael, it's freezing out. 
PAM: Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting. 
PAM: Michael, Jan's on line two. 
PAM: Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness! Stop dating my mother! 
PAM: Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party. 
PAM: Michael, please don't. 
PAM: Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself. 
PAM: Michael, she's perfect for you. 
PAM: Michael, stop. 
PAM: Michael, that seems impossible. 
PAM: Michael, that's fantastic. 
PAM: Michael, the pants don't have any pockets. 
PAM: Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you. 
PAM: Michael, this is a bad idea. 
PAM: Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done. 
PAM: Michael, wait! 
PAM: Michael, wait! I'm coming with you. 
PAM: Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis. 
PAM: Michael, we can hear you. 
PAM: Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going! 
PAM: Michael, what's going on? 
PAM: Michael, what's going on? 
PAM: Michael, what's wrong? 
PAM: Michael, why did you promise that? 
PAM: Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend? 
PAM: Michael, you did all this? 
PAM: Michael, you have to put your hands down. 
PAM: Michael, you need to get out of this. 
PAM: Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with. 
PAM: Michael, you were expecting me, right? 
PAM: Michael, you're just her rebound! 
PAM: Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible. 
PAM: Michael. 
PAM: Michael. 
PAM: Michael. 
PAM: Michael. 
PAM: Michael. 
PAM: Michael. 
PAM: Michael. Michael ,it's okay. 
PAM: Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you? 
PAM: Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael. 
PAM: Michael. Stop. 
PAM: Michael... 
PAM: Michael... 
PAM: Michael... 
PAM: Michael... 
PAM: Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy. 
PAM: Michael? 
PAM: Michael? 
PAM: Michael? 
PAM: Michael? 
PAM: Michael? 
PAM: Michael? 
PAM: Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone. 
PAM: Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don't know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out. 
PAM: Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day. 
PAM: Michael's still at the door. 
PAM: Mike Tibbets, really? 
PAM: Miles Davis. 
PAM: Mm.  Meredith! 
PAM: Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water? 
PAM: Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe. 
PAM: Mmhm. 
PAM: Mm-hm. 
PAM: mmhmm. 
PAM: Mmhmm. 
PAM: Mmhmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick? 
PAM: Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it. 
PAM: Mm-Hmm? 
PAM: Mm-hmmm. 
PAM: Mmm! Good pate, right?  Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar? 
PAM: Mmm, hmm. 
PAM: Mmm. 
PAM: Mmm. Hmm. 
PAM: Mmm... Yes. 
PAM: Mmm-hmm 
PAM: Mmmhmm. 
PAM: Mmm-hmm. 
PAM: Mmm-hmm. 
PAM: Mmm-hmm. 
PAM: Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking? 
PAM: Mmmm. 
PAM: MmMm. 
PAM: MmMm. You're getting colder. 
PAM: Mmmmm, yes! 
PAM: Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me. 
PAM: Mom! Pam's 
PAM: Mom, have you decided what you want to be called? 
PAM: Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my... 
PAM: Montana. 
PAM: More Dundies! Pam and 
PAM: More freedom fries. 
PAM: Morning Michael! 
PAM: Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times. 
PAM: Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office. 
PAM: My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks. Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe. 
PAM: My dad. 
PAM: My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding. 
PAM: My God. 
PAM: My husband would tell you to go for it. 
PAM: My job? My job is to get married in the morning. That's my job. 
PAM: My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in. 
PAM: My mother, Helene.  
PAM: My mother. 
PAM: My name is Pam. 
PAM: My old art room.  Oh, maybe it's still here!  No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind. 
PAM: My theory is that...  Michael and 
PAM: My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels-- 
PAM: Nashua got mp3 players. 
PAM: Nature. 
PAM: Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime. 
PAM: Nellie, why don t you tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you re listening. 
PAM: Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun. 
PAM: Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. 
PAM: New chairs? 
PAM: New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please? 
PAM: New York or Philadelphia. Graphics 
PAM: New York or Philadelphia. Graphics 
PAM: New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate. 
PAM: Next on the list - open the mail. 
PAM: Next on the list -- song parodies. 
PAM: Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married. 
PAM: Nice job. 
PAM: Nice job. 
PAM: Nice morning, too. 
PAM: Nice to meet you. 
PAM: Nice touch. 
PAM: Nice. 
PAM: Nice. 
PAM: Nice. 
PAM: Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now? 
PAM: Night 
PAM: Night Phyllis. 
PAM: Night, Creed.  
PAM: Night, Michael. 
PAM: Night. 
PAM: Night. 
PAM: No  don t. Just put it out of your mind. 
PAM: No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad. 
PAM: No football games, recitals, karate tournaments. 
PAM: No he hasn t. 
PAM: No I m just, I m saying, what would happen if they didn t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot? 
PAM: No I think you explained it. 
PAM: No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and.. 
PAM: No it's not. 
PAM: No Michael, why would you promise that? 
PAM: No no no no no! She'll wake up! 
PAM: No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela. 
PAM: No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim. 
PAM: No no, you can go home. I'm good. 
PAM: No one said it has no calories. 
PAM: No one. 
PAM: No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect. 
PAM: No talk, I'm animating. 
PAM: No thank you. 
PAM: No thanks, guys. 
PAM: No thanks. 
PAM: No thanks. 
PAM: No thanks. 
PAM: No the paper's not toxic. 
PAM: No yeah. Yeah. 
PAM: No you're not. 
PAM: No! 
PAM: No! 
PAM: No! How? I'm so clean! 
PAM: No! Just talk to her. 
PAM: No! No! 
PAM: No! No, I m interested. I mean I think everybody s interested in why they have to sing it. 
PAM: No, because...   
PAM: No, but that would've been a really good idea. 
PAM: No, come back! No, no, no! 
PAM: No, copier's great. 
PAM: No, don't! 
PAM: No, don't. I'm mad at them. 
PAM: No, Dwight! 
PAM: No, he hasn't. 
PAM: No, he's actually been really nice and helpful. 
PAM: No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot. 
PAM: No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah. 
PAM: No, I didn't. 
PAM: No, I do. 
PAM: No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I... are just... too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man. A man version. But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay. 
PAM: No, I don't think it's a bird. 
PAM: No, I get it, of course. OK.  
PAM: No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part. 
PAM: No, I know that you re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today. 
PAM: No, I know you are. 
PAM: No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started. 
PAM: No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago.  You know I have a kid with you, right? 
PAM: No, I m familiar with spinning. It s just that wouldn t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore- 
PAM: No, I m not upset. I m really excited for Darryl  Maybe I m a little disappointed that we ll be losing him. 
PAM: No, I made brownies. 
PAM: No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that? 
PAM: No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him. 
PAM: No, I mean it.  She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along.  
PAM: No, I mean, it feels... pressure. 
PAM: No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well. 
PAM: No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right? 
PAM: No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later. 
PAM: No, I should probably go too. 
PAM: No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged. 
PAM: No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person. 
PAM: No, I was um... 
PAM: No, I will not. 
PAM: No, I will not. 
PAM: No, I wouldn t. I can t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I d like to try. 
PAM: No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend? 
PAM: No, I'm not even wearing that much. 
PAM: No, I'm not going to do that. 
PAM: No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions. 
PAM: No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right? 
PAM: No, it has the little... 
PAM: No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that one time. 
PAM: No, it's horrible! Jim, she might get arrested. 
PAM: No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car? 
PAM: No, it's passing, it's fine. 
PAM: No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay. 
PAM: No, it's the pacifier's turn. 
PAM: No, it's, that's respectable. 
PAM: No, Jim, stay! 
PAM: No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one. 
PAM: No, keep it up. 
PAM: No, Kelly, don't. 
PAM: No, Michael, no. 
PAM: No, Michael. 
PAM: No, Michael. 
PAM: No, Michael. 
PAM: No, Michael. 
PAM: No, Michael's right. Jobs are safer. 
PAM: No, my all time favorite! 
PAM: No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants. 
PAM: No, no never. 
PAM: No, no, he's right. 
PAM: No, no, I m fine. 
PAM: No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there. 
PAM: No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second. 
PAM: No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans? 
PAM: No, no, no! 
PAM: No, no, no, "Tracks of My Tears" and what else? What are some more? What's one more? 
PAM: No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up. 
PAM: No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke. Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  
PAM: No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo! 
PAM: No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that. 
PAM: No, no, that guy who hit on me. 
PAM: No, no. 
PAM: No, no. 
PAM: No, no. 
PAM: No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!  
PAM: No, no. I still have time. 
PAM: No, no. It's the principle of the thing. 
PAM: No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion. 
PAM: No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad.  
PAM: No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500. 
PAM: No, not at all. 
PAM: No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her. 
PAM: No, not yet, Michael. 
PAM: No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love... 
PAM: No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi.   
PAM: No, okay. 
PAM: No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add "find office"... 
PAM: No, out! Get out now! Leave now. 
PAM: No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so. 
PAM: No, remind me. 
PAM: No, right, no, no. 
PAM: No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres. 
PAM: No, she brought you drawings. 
PAM: No, Stacy is a boy. Ugh. Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me? 
PAM: No, thank you. 
PAM: No, thank you. 
PAM: No, that was a long time ago. 
PAM: No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst? 
PAM: No, that's Afghan. 
PAM: No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes. 
PAM: No, there were a lot of reasons. 
PAM: No, they had to come back for me. 
PAM: No, they have been dating for like two years.  Since before your barbeque. 
PAM: No, they stopped making that show. 
PAM: No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and--  
PAM: No, three-month-old humans don't do that. 
PAM: No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far. 
PAM: No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust. 
PAM: No, wait, come on. I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month. 
PAM: No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought... 
PAM: No, we don't need to do that. 
PAM: No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember? 
PAM: No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so... 
PAM: No, we weren't. 
PAM: No, we're not. 
PAM: No, yeah. What? 
PAM: No, you just have little dainty fingers. 
PAM: No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there. 
PAM: No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No. 
PAM: No.  
PAM: No.  
PAM: No.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead.  
PAM: No. Are you kidding? 
PAM: No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love. 
PAM: No. Go ahead. 
PAM: No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail. 
PAM: No. I don't think I can hit you in the office. 
PAM: No. I have a life. 
PAM: No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so. 
PAM: No. I read in the book about nipple confusion. 
PAM: No. I'm such a dorky dancer. 
PAM: No. It just feels like pressure. 
PAM: No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool. 
PAM: No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha. 
PAM: No. It's crazy. 
PAM: No. Maybe he just said something funny. 
PAM: No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything. 
PAM: No. No no no!  
PAM: No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here. 
PAM: No. No.  
PAM: No. Pam's 
PAM: No. Roy? No. 
PAM: No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right? 
PAM: No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card. 
PAM: No. We're not gonna hire Ryan. 
PAM: No. What? Why? 
PAM: No. You were right. 
PAM: No..  
PAM: No... 
PAM: No...  Jim--- 
PAM: Nobody! 
PAM: Nobody. 
PAM: Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe. 
PAM: Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all. 
PAM: Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper. 
PAM: Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues?  
PAM: Nope. 
PAM: Nope. 
PAM: Nope. 
PAM: Nope. 
PAM: Nope. 
PAM: Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us. 
PAM: Nope. I, like you, have never been here before. 
PAM: Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine. 
PAM: Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor. 
PAM: Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200... 
PAM: Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now. 
PAM: Not at all. 
PAM: Not at work, I'll try it on--- 
PAM: Not classy. 
PAM: Not cool, Dwight.   
PAM: Not enough though. 
PAM: Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month. 
PAM: Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement. 
PAM: Not really, because I found one. 
PAM: Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl. 
PAM: Not relevant. 
PAM: Not relevant. 
PAM: Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se. 
PAM: Not the car! 
PAM: Not together! 
PAM: Not until midnight. 
PAM: Not us. 
PAM: Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check. 
PAM: Not yet. 
PAM: Nothing but vomit and diapers over here. 
PAM: Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again. 
PAM: Nothing new. 
PAM: Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her. 
PAM: Nothing. 
PAM: Nothing. 
PAM: Nothing. 
PAM: Nothing. I was just thinking of something else. 
PAM: Now please. 
PAM: Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy. 
PAM: Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system. 
PAM: Now there's, there's butter on my desk. 
PAM: Nuh-uh. 
PAM: O.   P. 
PAM: Of course you will. 
PAM: Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week. 
PAM: Of course. 
PAM: Of course. 
PAM: Of course. 
PAM: Of course. 
PAM: Of course. 
PAM: Of course. He's one of my closest friends. 
PAM: Of the FBI. 
PAM: Oh-  Thank you. Keena 
PAM: Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin? 
PAM: Oh boy. 
PAM: Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby? 
PAM: Oh gee I m  
PAM: Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God! Dwight's kind of my friend! 
PAM: Oh God! What?! 
PAM: Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping. 
PAM: Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything. 
PAM: Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it. 
PAM: Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move. 
PAM: Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority. 
PAM: Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
PAM: Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures. 
PAM: Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself. 
PAM: Oh look, they're starting.  
PAM: Oh me too. 
PAM: Oh my God! 
PAM: Oh my God! 
PAM: Oh my God! 
PAM: Oh my God! 
PAM: Oh my God! 
PAM: Oh my god! 
PAM: Oh my god! Ah! 
PAM: Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I Nellie, this is brilliant!  Hey! 
PAM: Oh my god! Is everyone OK? 
PAM: Oh my god! It's really you! 
PAM: Oh my god! Promo 
PAM: Oh my God, did you see "The Apprentice" last night? 
PAM: Oh my God, he hates me! 
PAM: Oh my God, he's really in pain. 
PAM: Oh my God, I think we've been robbed! 
PAM: Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me. 
PAM: Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!? 
PAM: Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go! 
PAM: Oh my God, that's a woman's suit! 
PAM: Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok? 
PAM: Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops. 
PAM: Oh my God. 
PAM: Oh my God. 
PAM: Oh my God. 
PAM: Oh my God. 
PAM: Oh my God.  Huge! 
PAM: Oh my god. He's Michael Scott. 
PAM: Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed. 
PAM: Oh my God. Is that Jan?  
PAM: Oh my God. It s Jan. 
PAM: Oh my goodness! 
PAM: Oh my goodness, you sound sexy. 
PAM: Oh my gosh, please, don't. 
PAM: Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have. 
PAM: Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so- 
PAM: Oh my gosh. 
PAM: Oh my gosh. 
PAM: Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot. 
PAM: Oh no you ain't! 
PAM: Oh no, do you think it was stolen? 
PAM: Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Aah!  Okay... 
PAM: Oh no, I just, I decided to stay. 
PAM: Oh no, I m fine. 
PAM: Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim. I'm not going out with Jim. You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together. 
PAM: Oh no. 
PAM: Oh no. 
PAM: Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us. 
PAM: Oh okay. 
PAM: Oh really? 
PAM: Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you! 
PAM: Oh right. 
PAM: Oh stop! I am so sorry! 
PAM: Oh wow, you weren't kidding. 
PAM: Oh yeah I bet. 
PAM: Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help. 
PAM: Oh yeah, your mom would love that. 
PAM: Oh yeah. 
PAM: Oh yeah. 
PAM: Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not. 
PAM: Oh yeah. That's too bad. 
PAM: Oh yeah? 
PAM: Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to? 
PAM: Oh! 
PAM: Oh! 
PAM: Oh! 
PAM: Oh! 
PAM: Oh!  
PAM: Oh!  
PAM: Oh!  Hey! How'd it go? 
PAM: Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who? 
PAM: Oh! Ha, haha. 
PAM: Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later. 
PAM: Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness! 
PAM: Oh! No, you should go. 
PAM: Oh! Oh! 
PAM: Oh! Ok. 
PAM: Oh! Text from Jim.  This is...  hmm. 
PAM: Oh! Uh, uh I'll go. 
PAM: Oh! Yes!  
PAM: Oh!... 
PAM: Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet. 
PAM: Oh, actually she can. 
PAM: Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so... 
PAM: Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay? 
PAM: Oh, and then this was Phyllis s idea  So nasty Phyllis! 
PAM: Oh, Andy. 
PAM: Oh, Andy. 
PAM: Oh, are you joking? 
PAM: Oh, awesome. You're a life saver.   Wait, is this just milk and sugar? 
PAM: Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting. 
PAM: Oh, boy. 
PAM: Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high. 
PAM: Oh, boy. Um  
PAM: Oh, call me later! 
PAM: Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding. 
PAM: Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way? 
PAM: Oh, cause it was upside down.  
PAM: Oh, cool. Hey Clark. 
PAM: Oh, damn.   They've been in there for like ten minutes. 
PAM: Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him. 
PAM: Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the...  
PAM: Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics. 
PAM: Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan! 
PAM: Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close? 
PAM: Oh, Erin... 
PAM: Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices! 
PAM: Oh, God! 
PAM: Oh, God. 
PAM: Oh, God. 
PAM: Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad. 
PAM: Oh, God. Oh, no. 
PAM: Oh, good. 
PAM: Oh, good. 
PAM: Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight. 
PAM: Oh, great!  His truck! 
PAM: Oh, great! That sounds good! 
PAM: Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece. 
PAM: Oh, great. Oh, I m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don t have it. 
PAM: Oh, great. Thank you. 
PAM: Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right? 
PAM: Oh, he's cute. 
PAM: Oh, hey Dwight. 
PAM: Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight. 
PAM: Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later. 
PAM: Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill. 
PAM: Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year's resolution board. 
PAM: Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie. 
PAM: Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello. 
PAM: Oh, hey, I'll just be a second. 
PAM: Oh, hey, Isabelle. 
PAM: Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out. 
PAM: Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit. 
PAM: Oh, hi Stanley. 
PAM: OH, Holy God! Delivery 
PAM: Oh, I can not believe I fell for that.  Oh, my God. 
PAM: Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor. 
PAM: Oh, I don't know if I'm... 
PAM: Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet. 
PAM: Oh, I don't know...  Oh my God. This is Jan's cell. 
PAM: Oh, I had a question. 
PAM: Oh, I have more.  
PAM: Oh, I just get those at any party supply place. 
PAM: Oh, I ll be the buyer. 
PAM: Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work. 
PAM: Oh, I m sorry. Sorry. 
PAM: Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting. 
PAM: Oh, I, um... 
PAM: Oh, I'll just time him later. 
PAM: Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please. 
PAM: Oh, it was this summer   
PAM: Oh, it's okay, sweetie. 
PAM: Oh, it's okay. 
PAM: Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job. 
PAM: Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles. 
PAM: Oh, Michael, thank you. Thank you. 
PAM: Oh, Michael, this is just for family. 
PAM: Oh, Michael. 
PAM: Oh, Michael. 
PAM: Oh, Michael. 
PAM: Oh, Michael. 
PAM: Oh, Michael. 
PAM: Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today.  'Cause of the...  
PAM: Oh, Michael... 
PAM: Oh, my God! It's incredible.  Is this the Boggle timer? 
PAM: Oh, my God. 
PAM: Oh, my God. 
PAM: Oh, my God. 
PAM: Oh, my God. 
PAM: Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the "C thing." 
PAM: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. 
PAM: Oh, my goodness. 
PAM: Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history. 
PAM: Oh, my gosh. 
PAM: Oh, my... 
PAM: Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went. 
PAM: Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird. 
PAM: Oh, no thank you. 
PAM: Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister. 
PAM: Oh, no, he can't make it. 
PAM: Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this.  
PAM: Oh, no, Kevin, it s not a joke. Angela s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind. 
PAM: Oh, no, no, no. 
PAM: Oh, no, that's, you don't have to. 
PAM: Oh, no. 
PAM: Oh, no. I just-- 
PAM: Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off. 
PAM: Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid. 
PAM: Oh, no. Your battery fell out. 
PAM: Oh, nothing that exciting. 
PAM: Oh, nothing. 
PAM: Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather. 
PAM: Oh, oh OK. 
PAM: Oh, oh. 
PAM: Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay. 
PAM: Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking. 
PAM: Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay. 
PAM: Oh, okay. It s just that s how Cece does it with the backwards  E s. 
PAM: Oh, okay. Okay, I will.  
PAM: Oh, okay. Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room.  But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation.  
PAM: Oh, okay... 
PAM: Oh, really? 
PAM: Oh, really? Already? 
PAM: Oh, right now? 
PAM: Oh, right, yeah. 
PAM: Oh, shoot. 
PAM: Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot. 
PAM: Oh, tell me, tell me. 
PAM: Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months. 
PAM: Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome! 
PAM: Oh, thank you. 
PAM: Oh, thank you. 
PAM: Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea. 
PAM: Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything. 
PAM: Oh, thanks! 
PAM: Oh, thanks, Kelly. 
PAM: Oh, thanks. 
PAM: Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me. 
PAM: Oh, that duck is so cute. 
PAM: Oh, that must've been so fun. 
PAM: Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight. 
PAM: Oh, that's too bad. 
PAM: Oh, their breadsticks are like crack! 
PAM: Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least. 
PAM: Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder. 
PAM: Oh, um, well, you know, I  I just  I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you d been filmed for nine years of your life, there d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself. Man 
PAM: Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting.   
PAM: Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums. 
PAM: Oh, we don't recycle. 
PAM: Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry. 
PAM: Oh, welcome back, Andy. 
PAM: Oh, well, thanks Oscar. I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom? 
PAM: Oh, well, Thursday s tough, because of  
PAM: Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all. 
PAM: Oh, which one is decaf? 
PAM: Oh, wow! 
PAM: Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin? 
PAM: Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is. 
PAM: Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne? 
PAM: Oh, yea! 
PAM: Oh, yeah I gave that up. 
PAM: Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don t think anything s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, my water broke. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, sorry. Hospital 
PAM: Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, um... 
PAM: Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey. 
PAM: Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate. 
PAM: Oh, yeah. Right. 
PAM: Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started. 
PAM: Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter. 
PAM: Oh, yeah... Maybe. 
PAM: Oh, you guys. Just one second.  Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch. 
PAM: Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away. 
PAM: Oh, you're dead. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh. 
PAM: Oh.  
PAM: Oh.   I really thought I didn't get it. 
PAM: Oh.  Are you... 
PAM: Oh.  Robert 
PAM: Oh. Drew. Sorry. 
PAM: Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald? 
PAM: Oh. I think you should get it. You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it. 
PAM: Oh. I would like a break. 
PAM: Oh. Oh God. 
PAM: Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'. 
PAM: Oh. Okay. 
PAM: Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect. 
PAM: Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was... 
PAM: Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want. 
PAM: Oh. Why me? 
PAM: Oh. You want to talk about it? 
PAM: Oh. You've changed so much. 
PAM: Oh.. 
PAM: Oh... 
PAM: Oh... 
PAM: Oh... come on, bear man. Come on.  
PAM: Oh... God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump. 
PAM: Oh... I'm pacing myself. 
PAM: Oh... is it... 
PAM: Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend? Front Desk 
PAM: Oh... um... no. That's... um... That's actually fine 
PAM: Oh? 
PAM: Ohh kay. 
PAM: Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you. 
PAM: Ohh...  
PAM: Ohh...  
PAM: Ohh... poor Kevin. 
PAM: Ohhh. 
PAM: Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable! 
PAM: Ohhhhhh! 
PAM: Oh--Oh my god!  
PAM: Oh-oh, gosh. Oh. 
PAM: Ok 
PAM: Ok  Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this. 
PAM: Ok fine I ll draw him.  
PAM: OK great! 
PAM: Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out? 
PAM: OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you. 
PAM: Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one. 
PAM: OK, bye. 
PAM: Ok, cool. 
PAM: Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God! 
PAM: Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on. 
PAM: OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why? 
PAM: OK, I like your food. 
PAM: Ok, it was the second one. 
PAM: Ok, just get to the good part. 
PAM: Ok, read it back to me. 
PAM: Ok, so is that my spot? 
PAM: OK, so then, when? 
PAM: Ok, that's uh, good news  Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go. 
PAM: Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot. 
PAM: Ok, wait wait wait wait... 
PAM: Ok, wait, so that would make me  like right here. 
PAM: Ok, well it wasn't obvious so...  
PAM: Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is. 
PAM: Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things. 
PAM: OK, well, why are you laying like that? 
PAM: OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1. 
PAM: OK, yeah. 
PAM: Ok, you've got to pull it together. 
PAM: OK. 
PAM: Ok. 
PAM: Ok. 
PAM: OK. 
PAM: OK.

PAM: Ok. 
PAM: OK. 
PAM: Ok. 
PAM: OK.  
PAM: Ok.  
PAM: Ok.  
PAM: OK.  Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that? 
PAM: OK.  Oh wow, you have a nice view. 
PAM: Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding. 
PAM: Ok. Bye Harvey. 
PAM: Ok. Bye. 
PAM: OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan? 
PAM: Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and... 
PAM: Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out... 
PAM: OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver. 
PAM: OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes. 
PAM: OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan? 
PAM: Ok. She's ok? 
PAM: Ok. Sure. 
PAM: Ok. There's a transcript between a naval ship- 
PAM: Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him- 
PAM: OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago- 
PAM: OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or... 
PAM: OK. Yeah. 
PAM: Ok... 
PAM: Okay Ben Franklin! 
PAM: Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay? 
PAM: Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight! 
PAM: Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter? 
PAM: Okay focus. Focus. You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened? 
PAM: Okay great.  Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  Wait, what?  Oh! Oh no! 
PAM: Okay I give up. What are you? 
PAM: Okay it's my turn. 
PAM: Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again. 
PAM: Okay let's go in. I'm freezing. 
PAM: Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it. 
PAM: Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy. 
PAM: Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the... 
PAM: Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself. 
PAM: Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez. 
PAM: Okay, fine. I'll take him. 
PAM: Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them.  Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because  this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.  
PAM: Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check.   Eat an enormous breakfast. Check. 
PAM: Okay, great. 
PAM: Okay, greatest strength. 
PAM: Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael. 
PAM: Okay, here I come.  Pam's 
PAM: Okay, I get it.   Why are you giggling? Is this a joke?   Michael, is this-- did I get the job? 
PAM: Okay, I know I ve been crying easily today, but-  I mean, that s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it s stupid. No.  It s wonderful. I m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it. Deleted Scene 1 
PAM: Okay, I told her you'd talk to her. 
PAM: Okay, I'm gonna head back. 
PAM: Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine.  Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it. 
PAM: Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you. 
PAM: Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl. 
PAM: Okay, Jim. 
PAM: Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio. 
PAM: Okay, let s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts? 
PAM: Okay, lets go. 
PAM: Okay, Michael, just settle down. 
PAM: Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather. 
PAM: Okay, now I'm laughing at you. 
PAM: Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight. 
PAM: Okay, okay. 
PAM: Okay, okay. 
PAM: Okay, Okay. Um  so  this past year has been really great, and you ve been great and I just  I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture  and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future. 
PAM: Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not? 
PAM: Okay, please hurry. 
PAM: Okay, Ryan Howard, yes. 
PAM: Okay, see you later. 
PAM: Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it. 
PAM: Okay, so, when you re selling to this woman, just imagine that she s that nice, reasonable barber. 
PAM: Okay, stop watching me. 
PAM: Okay, stop. 
PAM: Okay, thank you. 
PAM: Okay, thanks. 
PAM: Okay, that s enough.  
PAM: Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks 
PAM: Okay, that's it. 
PAM: Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle?  
PAM: Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge. 
PAM: Okay, umm... that would be Meredith. 
PAM: Okay, we have to get home. 
PAM: Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake. 
PAM: Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks. 
PAM: Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware. 
PAM: Okay, well it's just really loud. 
PAM: Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe. 
PAM: Okay, well you have to show us. 
PAM: Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right? 
PAM: Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine. 
PAM: Okay, we're going. 
PAM: Okay, when you re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now? 
PAM: Okay, which one of these looks more right?  
PAM: Okay, you do not have to do this. 
PAM: Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy. 
PAM: Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first. 
PAM: Okay. 
PAM: Okay.

PAM: Okay.  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence? 
PAM: Okay.  When did people sign- 
PAM: Okay. Angela? 
PAM: Okay. Aw, thank you. 
PAM: Okay. Bye. 
PAM: Okay. Diane 
PAM: Okay. Go Ahead. 
PAM: Okay. Graphics 
PAM: Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle. 
PAM: Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you. 
PAM: Okay. I'll go look for another one.  
PAM: Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare... 
PAM: Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture. 
PAM: Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim? 
PAM: Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I ll distract him, you take that. 
PAM: Okay. Okay. Yeah.  Christian 
PAM: Okay. Okay. Yes. 
PAM: Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if... 
PAM: Okay. So... you would be the Regional Manager, and the Assistant Regional Manager. Andy is your number two. I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager. 
PAM: Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone. 
PAM: Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael. 
PAM: Okay. Thank you. 
PAM: Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there.  Cool huh? 
PAM: Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here. 
PAM: Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story... 
PAM: Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it. 
PAM: Okay... 
PAM: On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark. 
PAM: On the drums! On the drums! 
PAM: On the left. 
PAM: Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is. 
PAM: Once point for me. 
PAM: One day for what? 
PAM: One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose? 
PAM: One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February. 
PAM: One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough. 
PAM: One of the tickets is for him. 
PAM: One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down. 
PAM: One's good. 
PAM: Ooh, Toby! 
PAM: Ooh. 
PAM: Oookay.... 
PAM: Open the door up! 
PAM: Or chairs? 
PAM: Or enough for everyone? 
PAM: Or even uses the copier every day. 
PAM: Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes. 
PAM: Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people. 
PAM: Or in a great chair. 
PAM: Or not adopt. 
PAM: Or what if... 
PAM: Or you proved that he thinks you're gay. 
PAM: Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy! 
PAM: Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days. 
PAM: Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby. 
PAM: Oscar, Cathy has a question! 
PAM: Oscar, did you bring it? 
PAM: Oscar, it was an honest mistake. 
PAM: Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor. 
PAM: Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands. 
PAM: Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive. 
PAM: Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself. 
PAM: Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right? 
PAM: Our friend, Seth, and his wife there. 
PAM: Our party is also starting now  
PAM: Pan? 
PAM: Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies. 
PAM: Parley? 
PAM: People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings! 
PAM: Perfect boobs,   of course I remember Holly. 
PAM: Personal shopper? 
PAM: Phallus? 
PAM: Phone's ringing.  
PAM: Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey. Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um... 
PAM: Phyllis there's a package for you. 
PAM: Phyllis! 
PAM: Phyllis! 
PAM: Phyllis! That's not safe. 
PAM: Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this! 
PAM: Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy. 
PAM: Phyllis. 
PAM: Phyllis. 
PAM: Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'. 
PAM: Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs. 
PAM: Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again. 
PAM: Please be Grandma. 
PAM: Please cut it out. 
PAM: Please don't talk about my breast milk. 
PAM: Please don't throw garbage at me. 
PAM: Please go back to your desk. 
PAM: Please stop saying what. Can you take him? 
PAM: Please? Just make sure he's OK?  
PAM: Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you. 
PAM: PM. 
PAM: Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street. 
PAM: Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents? 
PAM: Pregnant, no. 
PAM: Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh? 
PAM: Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison? 
PAM: Pro-Am race for the... They hung up. 
PAM: Probably. 
PAM: Psst. Jim.  Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you. 
PAM: Question. 
PAM: Quick 
PAM: Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together. 
PAM: Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl. 
PAM: Reach your arms out. 
PAM: Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper. 
PAM: Read it, please. I love amazing poetry. 
PAM: Read the pros first. 
PAM: Read through the pain. Be strong. 
PAM: Ready!   I m not as think as you drunk I am!   
PAM: Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible. 
PAM: Really well thank you all. 
PAM: Really you do. I love the material. 
PAM: Really! 
PAM: Really, Dwight? How fast are you? 
PAM: Really, Jim? On Cupid's birthday? 
PAM: Really, where? 
PAM: Really, you can t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he s basically Gumby with hair.  Suit Store 
PAM: Really. 
PAM: Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? 
PAM: Really? A beer sounds incredible right now. 
PAM: Really? I don't know. 
PAM: Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth? 
PAM: Really? Michael went in with him? 
PAM: Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four.  
PAM: Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy. 
PAM: Really? That's great. 
PAM: Really? Where did you hear that? 
PAM: Really?! Who?! 
PAM: Relax?! 
PAM: Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents? 
PAM: Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that? 
PAM: Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too. 
PAM: Right here. Little Michael Scott  
PAM: Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer.  
PAM: Right. 
PAM: Right. 
PAM: Right. 
PAM: Right. 
PAM: Right. But how'd you say it? 
PAM: Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too. 
PAM: Right? 
PAM: Right? Thank you! It s just Philly. Everyone s acting like it s New York or Paris or London. 
PAM: Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this. 
PAM: Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They re all deleted. 
PAM: Robert, is Nellie our new manager? 
PAM: Role call. 
PAM: Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big. 
PAM: Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January. 
PAM: Roy don't!  
PAM: Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it. 
PAM: Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think. 
PAM: Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now. 
PAM: ROY! 
PAM: Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding. 
PAM: Roy... 
PAM: Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring. 
PAM: Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway. 
PAM: Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars. 
PAM: Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him. 
PAM: Ryan, just tell us your plan. 
PAM: Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just... 
PAM: Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch. 
PAM: Salesman. 
PAM: Saw it. 
PAM: Say it. 
PAM: Say it. Where? 
PAM: Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe. 
PAM: Say they don t hire you. It s not like you re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you. 
PAM: Score. 
PAM: See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof? 
PAM: See you later.  
PAM: See you then. 
PAM: See, I feel bad about that. 
PAM: See, this is what I'm talking about. 
PAM: See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand. 
PAM: See? That wasn't so hard. 
PAM: Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes. 
PAM: Sell. 
PAM: Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb? 
PAM: Separate rooms. 
PAM: Seriously. 
PAM: Seriously? 
PAM: Seriously? Are you being serious? 
PAM: Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other. 
PAM: Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop? 
PAM: Set 
PAM: She does seem happy. 
PAM: She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you. 
PAM: She has a boyfriend. He's out of town. 
PAM: She missed you. 
PAM: She never sent it to you? 
PAM: She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points. 
PAM: She says "no" to everything. You know, she thinks my name is "No." Cece, do you want some broccoli? 
PAM: She still has feelings for you. 
PAM: She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her. 
PAM: She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up. 
PAM: She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey. 
PAM: She's not doing it to hurt you. 
PAM: She's not gonna say no. 
PAM: She's not gonna... Just... 
PAM: She's right, it works. I would imagine. 
PAM: She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along. 
PAM: She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement. 
PAM: She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously! 
PAM: She's up! Great! 
PAM: She's very religious. 
PAM: Shh! Kids are dancing. 
PAM: Shh, shh, shh. 
PAM: Shh, shh. 
PAM: Shh. 
PAM: Shh. 
PAM: Shh. Remember your lines. 
PAM: Shoot! 
PAM: Shoot, she fell off. 
PAM: Shoot. 
PAM: Should we get toppings? 
PAM: Shut it! 
PAM: Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother! 
PAM: Shut up! 
PAM: Shut up, Hide! I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I m okay with that. 
PAM: Shut up. I'm trying to be serious. 
PAM: Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know. 
PAM: Sixty-nine cup of noodles. 
PAM: Smokey, the bear? 
PAM: So about this proposal thing... 
PAM: So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler. 
PAM: So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now? 
PAM: So did everybody ... 
PAM: So embarrassing. 
PAM: So everyone here knows pirate code? 
PAM: So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance? 
PAM: So he's not related to Michelle Obama? 
PAM: So how do you come up with your cartoons? 
PAM: So how much antigravity potion do you want? 
PAM: So I closed the door but the image of his... 
PAM: So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder. 
PAM: So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online.  This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night.  This photo was taken this morning.  It's Cece.  She's never gonna do anything wrong. 
PAM: So it's a man? 
PAM: So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive. So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money. I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart. None of 'em called me back. Not even for an interview. 
PAM: So just be patient. 
PAM: So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days! 
PAM: So my corner's the one with the copier? 
PAM: So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do. 
PAM: So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself... 
PAM: So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes...The Horse Flyer. 
PAM: So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo. 
PAM: So rude, right? 
PAM: So Santa, what can we expect from this party? 
PAM: So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, "No way. You can't reserve seats." And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box. 
PAM: So someone is going to a court. Big deal. 
PAM: So suck it. 
PAM: So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me? 
PAM: So this is like, um, an organization station... Pam's 
PAM: So this is the dream team. 
PAM: So this was all just a trick. You don t really have any business to give? 
PAM: So um- 
PAM: So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing... 
PAM: So we basically had no privacy for ten years. 
PAM: So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable. 
PAM: So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead? 
PAM: So weird that there is no paperwork. 
PAM: So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad. 
PAM: So what are you going to get me instead? 
PAM: So what did you want to show me? 
PAM: So what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight? 
PAM: So what happened? 
PAM: So what is your gift? 
PAM: So what's it gonna be? 
PAM: So when are we going out? 
PAM: So when are you due? 
PAM: So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work? 
PAM: So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So- 
PAM: So you have an office and a workspace? 
PAM: So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player? 
PAM: So you know the feeling. 
PAM: So, can I..?  
PAM: So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year. 
PAM: So, cool right? 
PAM: So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh!     I've been driving too long. 
PAM: So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours? 
PAM: So, how s it going? 
PAM: So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on.   It is so on. 
PAM: So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding. 
PAM: So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura. 
PAM: So, it really is just about the cupcakes. 
PAM: So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office? 
PAM: So, kinda like a receptionist. 
PAM: So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that? 
PAM: So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more... 
PAM: So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's so nice. 
PAM: So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year? 
PAM: So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring? 
PAM: So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab. 
PAM: So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch... 
PAM: So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room. 
PAM: So, um... we'll do it after work. In the parking lot. In front of everyone. I'm going to hit you as hard as I can. 
PAM: So, umm, is this your first office job then? 
PAM: So, we had couple's therapy. 
PAM: So, what do you say we get started? 
PAM: So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months... 
PAM: So, you're okay? 
PAM: So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings.... 
PAM: So.. 
PAM: So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is.  Sorry I didn't wrap it. 
PAM: So? You started it! 
PAM: Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx. 
PAM: Some candy. 
PAM: Some of us like the walk more than others. 
PAM: Some people. 
PAM: Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way. 
PAM: Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know. 
PAM: Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch? 
PAM: Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck. 
PAM: Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt. 
PAM: Sometimes I just don't get Roy. 
PAM: Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting. 
PAM: Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it. 
PAM: Song parody writer. 
PAM: Sorry Andy. 
PAM: Sorry I almost got you killed. 
PAM: Sorry we're late. 
PAM: Sorry! 
PAM: Sorry, I .. 
PAM: Sorry, that's not my problem. 
PAM: Sorry. 
PAM: Sorry. 
PAM: Sorry. 
PAM: Sorry. 
PAM: Sorry. 
PAM: Sorry. 
PAM: Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead. 
PAM: Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup. 
PAM: Sorry? 
PAM: Sorta, yes. 
PAM: Sounds like Cece. 
PAM: Sounds like it. 
PAM: Sounds like you're doing alright. 
PAM: Sprinkle of cinnamon. 
PAM: Stanley got to go. 
PAM: Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen? 
PAM: Step away. 
PAM: Steve Martin's not dead, Michael. 
PAM: Still no one calling. 
PAM: Stop drinking the water! Stop! 
PAM: Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you. 
PAM: Stop it, please. 
PAM: Stop it.  
PAM: Stop stalling! Come on. 
PAM: Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on. 
PAM: Stop that! 
PAM: Stop.  
PAM: Stop. Don't. Just... 
PAM: Stop. Out with it. 
PAM: Straight. 
PAM: Stuff gets around. I don't participate. 
PAM: Super important. 
PAM: Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art. 
PAM: Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning. 
PAM: Sure, do you have a camera here? 
PAM: Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds. 
PAM: Sure, no problem. 
PAM: Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton? 
PAM: Sure, what's up? 
PAM: Sure, yeah. Yeah. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. 
PAM: Sure. Anything else? 
PAM: Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight. 
PAM: Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat. 
PAM: Sure. Meredith, do you mind? 
PAM: Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse. 
PAM: Swaying isn't dancing. 
PAM: Switch the computers back Andy. 
PAM: Table making never seemed so possible. 
PAM: Ta-da! 
PAM: Talk about it now. 
PAM: Talk to you later? 
PAM: Tears of a clown! 
PAM: Tell 'em how it happened. 
PAM: Tell me before I come there. 
PAM: Tell me I'm good at sales. 
PAM: Tell me one thing about you I don't know. 
PAM: Tell them what happened last year. 
PAM: Tell them your opening line. 
PAM: Tell us what you're talking about. 
PAM: Ten minutes. 
PAM: Ten minutes. Pam's 
PAM: Ten years ago, I didn t care if Dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I m like, that poor gimp is somebody s child. 
PAM: Ten... 
PAM: Terrible. 
PAM: Thank God you were there. 
PAM: Thank goodness he was there. 
PAM: Thank you weirdo. Pam's 
PAM: Thank you! 
PAM: Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know?  Okay. Well, excuuuuse me. 
PAM: Thank you, bye-bye. 
PAM: Thank you, Dwight. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Thank you.  
PAM: Thank you.   
PAM: Thank you.  Oh my gosh. It's really good. 
PAM: Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon! 
PAM: Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that. 
PAM: Thank you. I knew it. 
PAM: Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet. 
PAM: Thank you. Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine. 
PAM: Thank you. You will not be sorry. 
PAM: Thank, Michael. 
PAM: Thanks Dwight. 
PAM: Thanks Michael. 
PAM: Thanks mom. Pam's 
PAM: Thanks Toby. 
PAM: Thanks! 
PAM: Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right? 
PAM: Thanks, Brian. 
PAM: Thanks, Kevin. 
PAM: Thanks, Michael. 
PAM: Thanks. 
PAM: Thanks. 
PAM: Thanks. 
PAM: Thanks. 
PAM: Thanks. 
PAM: Thanks. 
PAM: Thanks. 
PAM: Thanks. 
PAM: Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention.   
PAM: That a couple of times- 
PAM: That could really be fun. 
PAM: That doesn't seem fair. 
PAM: That fast? 
PAM: That is a great idea. Phone 
PAM: That is amazing! 
PAM: That is right. Don't make any more of it. 
PAM: That is so cool. Thanks Dwight! 
PAM: That is so insulting. 
PAM: That is! 
PAM: That means another twelve weeks.   Can you do this for another three months? 
PAM: That movie is so scary! 
PAM: That one's great. 
PAM: That s a license number? 
PAM: That s regular pizza. 
PAM: That s sweet that he talks about me. Athlead 
PAM: That s true. 
PAM: That s what he says. 
PAM: That sounds nice. 
PAM: That sounds nice. 
PAM: That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy. 
PAM: That there are no rules. 
PAM: That was funny. 
PAM: That was our dream wedding. 
PAM: That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die. 
PAM: That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs.   I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.   Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump. 
PAM: That would have been funny. 
PAM: That you remember her. 
PAM: That'd be great. 
PAM: That's a communal bowl. 
PAM: That's a great idea. 
PAM: That's a really big decision. 
PAM: That's a really... well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do? 
PAM: That's a sad story. 
PAM: That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed.  
PAM: That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin. 
PAM: That's all she said. 
PAM: That's amazing. 
PAM: That's as specific as I'd like to be. 
PAM: That's awesome. Where are you staying? 
PAM: That's awesome. You want some ice cream? 
PAM: That's cool. 
PAM: That's cool. 
PAM: That's cool.   Mm, good stuff.   
PAM: That's dangerous. 
PAM: That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle. 
PAM: That's good advice. 
PAM: That's good.  
PAM: That's great! 
PAM: That's great. 
PAM: That's great. 
PAM: That's great. 
PAM: That's great. 
PAM: That's great.  
PAM: That's it, last one.  
PAM: That's it. 
PAM: That's Michael. You're out with Michael? 
PAM: That's my dress. 
PAM: That's nice, Dwight. 
PAM: That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears. 
PAM: That's not accurate. 
PAM: That's OK. 
PAM: That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones. 
PAM: That's ok. It's ok. 
PAM: That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head. 
PAM: That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that? 
PAM: That's really nice Michael. 
PAM: That's right, you did. 
PAM: That's right. 
PAM: That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem. 
PAM: That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump? 
PAM: That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right? 
PAM: That's what he said. 
PAM: That's what Michael said. 
PAM: That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh. 
PAM: That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando. 
PAM: The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm. 
PAM: The Beets Motel. 
PAM: The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good. 
PAM: The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards. 
PAM: The fridge, got it. 
PAM: The fridge. 
PAM: The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it. 
PAM: The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game. 
PAM: The guy we're meeting with? 
PAM: The hospital. 
PAM: The nerve. 
PAM: The news that you just announced? That Ed died? 
PAM: The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair? 
PAM: the one pie that I don't. 
PAM: The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts. 
PAM: The phones are dead. 
PAM: The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here. 
PAM: The professors would go to the parties? 
PAM: The reverse cycling ends tonight!  
PAM: The Senator?  He was married before, and he has a kid. 
PAM: The shipping place closes in a half hour. 
PAM: The signs will drive people inside. 
PAM: The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens. 
PAM: The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth. 
PAM: The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child. 
PAM: The timeline's messy. 
PAM: The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them. 
PAM: The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair. 
PAM: The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12. 
PAM: The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so.. 
PAM: The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins. 
PAM: Theme song from Saved by the Bell. 
PAM: Then come back soon. 
PAM: Then I'm gonna end fast. 
PAM: Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle. 
PAM: Then we can go to dinner. Pam's 
PAM: Then who do you think will get the job? 
PAM: Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge? 
PAM: Then why'd you even offer!? 
PAM: There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ... it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy. 
PAM: There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work. 
PAM: There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone. 
PAM: There he is! Phone 
PAM: There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, "What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?" He said, "If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks." 
PAM: There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there. 
PAM: There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it. 
PAM: There is now. We just started it. 
PAM: There s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it s not -- it doesn t sound cool. You just have to see it. 
PAM: There we go. 
PAM: There we go. 
PAM: There.  
PAM: There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here? 
PAM: There's a KISS cover band in here. 
PAM: There's a person here who wants to sell handbags. 
PAM: There's a person here... 
PAM: There's a plan. 
PAM: There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30. 
PAM: There's no building... it doesn't exist. 
PAM: There's no one from England, Jim. Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages. 
PAM: There's no yelling in that, either. 
PAM: There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking.  
PAM: There's nothing new. 
PAM: There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake! 
PAM: There's that ass! 
PAM: There's... 
PAM: These are my painting clothes.I think I m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.  
PAM: These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli? 
PAM: They are. 
PAM: They came up with that idea really fast. 
PAM: They do call me that. 
PAM: They have art classes? 
PAM: They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job. But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone.   Vending machine. Phone 
PAM: They re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don t blame Cece. 
PAM: They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars? 
PAM: They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat. 
PAM: They're beautiful. 
PAM: They're both single, I have a sense they might- 
PAM: They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell. 
PAM: They're not of Cece. 
PAM: They're not that bad still, babe. 
PAM: They're on the supply shelf. 
PAM: They're so not. 
PAM: They're the same picture. 
PAM: They're wedding bands. 
PAM: Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face. 
PAM: Think so. 
PAM: This could all go away if you just tell me the truth. Old 
PAM: This is a huge sale. 
PAM: This is a new cardigan. 
PAM: This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything. 
PAM: This is from all of us. 
PAM: This is happening! 
PAM: This is Michael, my boss.  Justin. 
PAM: This is Mr. Scott. 
PAM: This is my friend Julie. 
PAM: This is not enough for you and I m afraid that I m not enough for you. 
PAM: This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances. 
PAM: This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together. 
PAM: This is over. 
PAM: This is Pam. 
PAM: This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office. 
PAM: This is so cheesy. 
PAM: This is so cool. 
PAM: This is terrible. 
PAM: This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident.  He didn't do anything sexual.  He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes.  It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program. 
PAM: This is what you did last night? 
PAM: This is where I used to keep my computer. Pam's 
PAM: This looks great, Michael. 
PAM: This night was a disaster. 
PAM: This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her. 
PAM: This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her. 
PAM: This wasn't on the list. 
PAM: This. 
PAM: Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one. 
PAM: Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00? 
PAM: Three kitchens? 
PAM: Three.  
PAM: Tie goes to the girlfriend. 
PAM: Tightly wound? 
PAM: To ask for directions.. 
PAM: Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us? 
PAM: Toby, why don't you open your present? 
PAM: Toby, you're the best. 
PAM: Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple.   Look, it's official!   
PAM: Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times. 
PAM: Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology. Todd 
PAM: Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple.   What up, 212? 
PAM: Too late. My hopes are up. 
PAM: Took him 40 minutes to get ready. 
PAM: Total golf text. Send it. 
PAM: Trip Advsior. 
PAM: Try a different door. 
PAM: Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight. 
PAM: Twelve drummers drumming.  
PAM: Two children, yes. 
PAM: Two? 
PAM: Ugh. 
PAM: Ugh. 
PAM: Ugh... 
PAM: Uh hmm. 
PAM: Uh huh. 
PAM: Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss! 
PAM: Uh totally. 
PAM: Uh, buying lottery tickets online.  
PAM: Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper ,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim.  And go ahead!  
PAM: Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water. 
PAM: Uh, hmmm. 
PAM: Uh, huh. Yes. 
PAM: Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone. 
PAM: Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club. 
PAM: Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice. Captain 
PAM: Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon. 
PAM: Uh, just one second. We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available. It's Jan. 
PAM: Uh, just put him through to me. 
PAM: Uh, Michael? 
PAM: Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here. 
PAM: Uh, not on a three month boat trip. 
PAM: Uh, Phyllis got a good look. 
PAM: Uh, sure. 
PAM: Uh, that seems inappropriate. 
PAM: Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged. 
PAM: Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation.  I appreciate the sacrifice. 
PAM: Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy. 
PAM: Uh, yeah, the one... 
PAM: Uh, yeah. 
PAM: Uh, yeah. Just a fax. 
PAM: Uh, yes. Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes. 
PAM: Uh... 
PAM: Uh... my mother's coming. 
PAM: Uh... no. 
PAM: Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do. 
PAM: Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous! 
PAM: Uhh, I think it's something like umm... 
PAM: Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe? 
PAM: Uh-huh. 
PAM: Uh-huh. 
PAM: Uh-huh. 
PAM: Uhm. 
PAM: Um  yes. Definitely. With your hair   
PAM: Um, 2? 
PAM: Um, about the beach... 
PAM: Um, actually, funny story -- I didn t get it. I shouldn t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all. 
PAM: Um, did my dad say anything about my mom? 
PAM: Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom? 
PAM: Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. 
PAM: Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused... 
PAM: Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too. 
PAM: Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa. 
PAM: Um, hi. How are you? 
PAM: Um, I am a little busy. 
PAM: Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great! 
PAM: Um, I don't know if I really see you two together. 
PAM: Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues? 
PAM: Um, I don't think so, I just bought it. 
PAM: Um, I have a question. 
PAM: Um, I just wanted to say thanks. 
PAM: Um, I really liked your karaoke idea. 
PAM: Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake. 
PAM: Um, I'm not bothering you, am I? 
PAM: Um, it's kind of private. 
PAM: Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it. 
PAM: Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward. 
PAM: Um, just something somebody wrote. 
PAM: Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day. 
PAM: Um, Pam plus Spam plus...? 
PAM: Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.  
PAM: Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there? 
PAM: Um, usually like that. 
PAM: Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now. 
PAM: Um, what should we talk about? 
PAM: Um, what? 
PAM: Um, yeah, that would be great. 
PAM: Um. Ok, bye. 
PAM: Um... 
PAM: Um... 
PAM: Um... 
PAM: Um... 
PAM: Um... 
PAM: Um...  A ...  X ? I don t -- you got me. 
PAM: Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up. 
PAM: Um... Are you... 
PAM: Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great. 
PAM: Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today. 
PAM: Um... I think it's really, really unlikely. 
PAM: Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend. 
PAM: Um... Oscar's kind of cute. 
PAM: Um... uh... I'll get back to you. 
PAM: Um... you wanna buy it? 
PAM: Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go. 
PAM: Umm,  yearbook! 
PAM: Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign. 
PAM: Umm, let me see. 
PAM: Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to... 
PAM: Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle? 
PAM: Umm... it was not that long ago. 
PAM: Ummm, I don't know. 
PAM: Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up. 
PAM: Ummm... 
PAM: Ummmm... 
PAM: Understood. 
PAM: United front... 
PAM: Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me. 
PAM: Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic! 
PAM: Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us. 
PAM: Us. 
PAM: Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke. 
PAM: Very brave choice also, I thought. 
PAM: Very interesting. 
PAM: Very official. 
PAM: W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get. 
PAM: Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt. 
PAM: Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is. 
PAM: Wait, are those Michael's Levis? 
PAM: Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me. 
PAM: Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him? 
PAM: Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up? 
PAM: Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here! 
PAM: Wait, wait. What? 
PAM: Wait, wait. What's this?  
PAM: Wait, what did it say? 
PAM: Wait, what? 
PAM: Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him.  
PAM: Wait, when did we start calling it that- 
PAM: Wait. Can you back up? What's the story? 
PAM: Wait. I don't have my scarf. 
PAM: Wait. What? 
PAM: Watson carpet and tile. 
PAM: We already offered free delivery! 
PAM: We are a family. 
PAM: We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out,  Nice jugs ? 
PAM: We are good to goooo! 
PAM: We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain. 
PAM: We can do that. 
PAM: We can do this. 
PAM: We can move out. 
PAM: We can relax. 
PAM: We can watch a movie and play Rock Band. 
PAM: We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened. 
PAM: We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity? 
PAM: We could get Deangelo flowers. 
PAM: We could work from home. 
PAM: We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed. 
PAM: We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child. 
PAM: We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second.   Michael. Stop for a second. 
PAM: We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much. 
PAM: We didn't dance. 
PAM: We discuss...  the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party.  Not mean. 
PAM: We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything. 
PAM: We don't normally download films illegally. Because we're honest, hardworking people. 
PAM: We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into. 
PAM: We got the van at a used car lot. We think it says "Alleluia Church of Scranton." in Korean. It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it. 
PAM: We got you this.  
PAM: We have a meeting with an investor today. 
PAM: We have an extra outfit in the bag. 
PAM: We have an investor already? 
PAM: We have good give and take.  I give, he takes. 
PAM: We have maybe a month. I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
PAM: We have peanut butter in the kitchen. 
PAM: We have to come from a position of strength. 
PAM: We have vodka! 
PAM: We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off, if they came. So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work. 
PAM: We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people. 
PAM: We need a new manager. 
PAM: We need an infiltrator. 
PAM: We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group.  Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him. 
PAM: We need everything back the way it was. 
PAM: We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas. 
PAM: We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today. 
PAM: We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you. 
PAM: We re fine. Yeah.  And I m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn t you be? 
PAM: We re so excited. 
PAM: We really did. It was fun. 
PAM: We said part not all. 
PAM: We said some. We said  some.  
PAM: We should break this hinge maybe. 
PAM: We should get him a bus ticket.  To make his trip easier. 
PAM: We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures. 
PAM: We should just take him down. 
PAM: We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic... 
PAM: We thought. 
PAM: We took a walk. 
PAM: We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone. 
PAM: We were basically Romeo and Juliet. 
PAM: We were hoping you could do something like this  Tattoo 
PAM: We were something else. 
PAM: We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby. 
PAM: We will be well-rested tomorrow. 
PAM: We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times. 
PAM: Weapons. 
PAM: We'd love to see it! 
PAM: Week off. That'd be great. 
PAM: Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much. 
PAM: Welcome back, Stanley.  
PAM: Well-- 
PAM: Well   
PAM: Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds? 
PAM: We'll be back! 
PAM: Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again. 
PAM: Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents. 
PAM: Well done. 
PAM: Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning. 
PAM: We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine.  
PAM: We'll find him. 
PAM: We'll go tell everyone. 
PAM: Well have fun with that. 
PAM: Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this. 
PAM: Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott.   He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses. 
PAM: Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here? 
PAM: Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it. 
PAM: Well I think they'll get the spirit of it. 
PAM: Well I was taking the picture. 
PAM: Well I'm gonna start fast. 
PAM: Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that. 
PAM: Well I'm not the receptionist. 
PAM: Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters. 
PAM: Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building. 
PAM: We'll keep looking. 
PAM: Well thanks. 
PAM: Well that never happened. 
PAM: Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use? 
PAM: Well the first one has a surprise factor. "I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!" 
PAM: Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier. 
PAM: Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me? 
PAM: Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs? 
PAM: Well you seem a little tired. 
PAM: Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes! 
PAM: Well, actually, rhubarb is- 
PAM: Well, are you dating anyone? 
PAM: Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over. 
PAM: Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now. 
PAM: Well, get it out of here. 
PAM: Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page. 
PAM: Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin. 
PAM: Well, I am a few months ahead of you. 
PAM: Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-  
PAM: Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone. 
PAM: Well, I didn't think that butt was funny. 
PAM: Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official.  
PAM: Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di... 
PAM: Well, I guess it doesn t look that cool either. But, it s been up there a long time, so it s become a pretty big deal. 
PAM: Well, I kind of liked Legal... 
PAM: Well, I m heading out to Cece s dance recital. 
PAM: Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don t know. I m working on something. 
PAM: Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But .. 
PAM: Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle. 
PAM: Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas. 
PAM: Well, I um... I... I can't. 
PAM: Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out.  Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera- 
PAM: Well, I wish you would. 
PAM: Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either. 
PAM: Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers. 
PAM: Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it? 
PAM: Well, is that really a priority? 
PAM: Well, it does and it doesn't. 
PAM: Well, it doesn t spin. We ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and  you see what chore you get that day. 
PAM: Well, it was an important phone call. 
PAM: Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan. 
PAM: Well, it wasn't an affair. 
PAM: Well, let's hear it. 
PAM: Well, let's play, what is it? 
PAM: Well, look closer. 
PAM: Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar. 
PAM: Well, maybe we can put the box back together. 
PAM: Well, maybe you'll meet someone. 
PAM: Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him. 
PAM: Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell? 
PAM: Well, okay! 
PAM: Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick. 
PAM: Well, she can't bring this up with her. 
PAM: Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby. 
PAM: Well, something's off. 
PAM: Well, thanks for being a good friend. 
PAM: Well, that didn't have anything to do with you. 
PAM: Well, that s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia. Athlead 
PAM: Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier. 
PAM: Well, the promo for the documentary aired today. 
PAM: Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak. 
PAM: Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture. 
PAM: Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone s ever been fired, Toby s blocked it, so  
PAM: Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image. 
PAM: Well, wait. 
PAM: Well, we won t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks. 
PAM: Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned. 
PAM: Well, what does that... is that... okay. 
PAM: Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck? 
PAM: Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small.   If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle!   
PAM: Well, you  you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. 
PAM: Well, you have good taste. 
PAM: Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging... 
PAM: Well, you know. 
PAM: Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time. Pam's 
PAM: Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing. 
PAM: Well, you like that. 
PAM: Well, you should cover it with the broccoli. 
PAM: Well, you shouldn t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim. 
PAM: Well, you were never really engaged. 
PAM: Well, you'll figure it out. 
PAM: Well. I don't know. 
PAM: Well.. um I, I don't... 
PAM: Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way. 
PAM: Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off... 
PAM: Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um... 
PAM: Well... no, I don't... exactly... what? 
PAM: Well...this is it. 
PAM: We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie. 
PAM: We're friends. 
PAM: We're friends. We'll always be friends. 
PAM: We're getting married today. 
PAM: We're getting pretty good at it.     
PAM: We're good to goooo! 
PAM: We're having a press conference? 
PAM: We're hoping our interview seals the deal. 
PAM: We're in. 
PAM: We're not dating, we're engaged. 
PAM: We're not going for yogurt. 
PAM: We're not high. 
PAM: We're not laughing at you, Dwight. 
PAM: We're really parents now. 
PAM: We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves. 
PAM: We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us. 
PAM: We're together. 
PAM: Were you painting in the dark? 
PAM: What a cute bench. 
PAM: What about before? Was I attractive before? 
PAM: What about five years from now? 
PAM: What about Meredith? 
PAM: What about Ryan? 
PAM: What about the honeymoon? 
PAM: What about your gift Michael? 
PAM: What am I doing wrong, Brian? 
PAM: What are the odds that this is in any way real? 
PAM: What are the themes? 
PAM: What are they doing? 
PAM: What are we doing? 
PAM: What are you doing out here? 
PAM: What are you doing? 
PAM: What are you doing? 
PAM: What are you doing? 
PAM: What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that? 
PAM: What are you doing?! 
PAM: What are you going to do with your time off? 
PAM: What are you gonna do? 
PAM: What are you guys going to do? 
PAM: What are you so excited about? 
PAM: What are you sorry for? 
PAM: What are you talking about? Yes we can. 
PAM: What are you up to? 
PAM: What can't you tell me? 
PAM: What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him? 
PAM: What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me? 
PAM: What did Jan want? 
PAM: What did you guys talk about? 
PAM: What did you say to my dad? 
PAM: What do we do? 
PAM: What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much. It's just a bird." But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above. 
PAM: What do you feed her? 
PAM: What do you mean? 
PAM: What do you mean? 
PAM: What do you mean? 
PAM: What do you mean? 
PAM: What do you mean? 
PAM: What do you need, Michael? 
PAM: What do you think? 
PAM: What do you want from me? 
PAM: What do you want me to do? 
PAM: What do you want to dish about? 
PAM: What do you want to say, Michael? 
PAM: What do you want us to do? 
PAM: What does that even mean? 
PAM: What does that even mean? Where would your name appear? 
PAM: What does that mean? 
PAM: What flavors did you get?  
PAM: What happened to grape soda? 
PAM: What happened? 
PAM: What happened? 
PAM: What happened? Did you miss your bus? 
PAM: What have you done? Dwight : Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now. Mose : Aaaaahhhhh! 
PAM: What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim? 
PAM: What is going on? 
PAM: What is happening there?   
PAM: What is he doing? 
PAM: What is it? 
PAM: What is it?  Don't touch it. 
PAM: What is that? 
PAM: What is this? 
PAM: What kind of prank are you thinking? 
PAM: What moves? 
PAM: What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us! 
PAM: What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way. 
PAM: What s going on? 
PAM: What s that? 
PAM: What should we do now? 
PAM: What suggestion box? 
PAM: What was Oprah about? 
PAM: What was prison like? 
PAM: What was that? 
PAM: What was that?!  
PAM: What was the last one? 
PAM: What!? 
PAM: What, no. That can't...I don't... 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What? 
PAM: What?   Oh... 
PAM: What?  Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something.  You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason.  Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything.  
PAM: What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing. 
PAM: What? Dwight, you can t do that. 
PAM: What? Erin is that true? 
PAM: What? Honey, we talked about this. 
PAM: What? Jim. 
PAM: What? Look, no it was not... 
PAM: What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you. 
PAM: What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer. 
PAM: What? No, it's not... it's nothing. 
PAM: What? Really? 
PAM: What? What do you mean, suspend me? 
PAM: What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God!  Honey? Jim? Jim! 
PAM: What? Why not? 
PAM: What? Why? 
PAM: What? You have something you want to say? 
PAM: What?! 
PAM: What?! 
PAM: What?! 
PAM: What?! 
PAM: What?! No! I-I got this.  Okay? 
PAM: Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom... 
PAM: What's going on, why do you have a second job? 
PAM: What's going on? 
PAM: What's going on? 
PAM: What's going on? Do you know that guy? 
PAM: What's our punishment? 
PAM: What's ours again? 
PAM: What's that come to? Like, what did they each win? 
PAM: What's that supposed to mean? 
PAM: What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom? 
PAM: What's this? 
PAM: What's up? 
PAM: What's up? 
PAM: What's up? 
PAM: What's wrong Michael? 
PAM: What's wrong with cupcakes? 
PAM: What's wrong? 
PAM: What's wrong? 
PAM: What's wrong? 
PAM: When- 
PAM: When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child. He didn't know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, "Drive, kid. I trust you." 
PAM: When are you leaving? 
PAM: When are you talking to David Wallace? 
PAM: When did you find time to do all this? 
PAM: When does he hear? 
PAM: When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference. 
PAM: When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should have written that. 
PAM: When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim. 
PAM: When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one. 
PAM: When was the last time you went to the doctor? 
PAM: When you cried? 
PAM: When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them.   
PAM: When's the contest? 
PAM: Where are you going? 
PAM: Where are you? 
PAM: Where s Angela?  
PAM: Where'd you put it? 
PAM: Where's Alyssa? 
PAM: Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim. 
PAM: White. 
PAM: Who are you? 
PAM: Who cares?  It's not that huge a sale. 
PAM: Who did you tell? 
PAM: Who is it? 
PAM: Who is 'Long Tim'? 
PAM: Who is that? 
PAM: Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman s? 
PAM: Who the heck was that? 
PAM: Who told you that? 
PAM: Who went? 
PAM: Who? The - 
PAM: Whoa! 
PAM: Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that? 
PAM: Whoa, are those mini pizzas? 
PAM: Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim? 
PAM: Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo. 
PAM: Whoa. 
PAM: Whoo-hoo go, Meredith s stripper son. 
PAM: Who's that? 
PAM: Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing? 
PAM: Why are you here? 
PAM: Why are you wearing a hat now? 
PAM: Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me? 
PAM: Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it. 
PAM: Why did that come into your brain? 
PAM: Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job. 
PAM: Why did you put it off until Halloween? 
PAM: Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback? 
PAM: Why do we have to see what Dwight says? 
PAM: Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us. 
PAM: Why do you doubt that she s single? 
PAM: Why do you need more gas? 
PAM: Why do you need to wear the holster at all? 
PAM: Why don t I help you now? 
PAM: Why don't you go do some work? 
PAM: Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office? 
PAM: Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis? 
PAM: Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend? 
PAM: Why is there a circle with a line through it? 
PAM: Why is your face gold? 
PAM: Why might some say that? 
PAM: Why not? 
PAM: Why was he making her laugh so much? 
PAM: Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it. 
PAM: Why would anyone go to jail for that? 
PAM: Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy? 
PAM: Why would you want to raise your cholesterol? 
PAM: Why? 
PAM: Why? Does he think you're going to Florida? 
PAM: Why's he making her laugh so much? 
PAM: Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick? 
PAM: Win 
PAM: Win! 
PAM: Win. 
PAM: Woo! 
PAM: Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet! 
PAM: Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away! 
PAM: Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart? 
PAM: Would bring me a flavored coffee. 
PAM: Would I make that up? 
PAM: Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers? 
PAM: Wow! 
PAM: Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that. 
PAM: Wow! That was easy. 
PAM: Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh? 
PAM: Wow, an ultimatum. 
PAM: Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion. 
PAM: Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations. 
PAM: Wow, that's impressive. 
PAM: Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement. 
PAM: Wow, this place is  so great. I had no idea   on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky. 
PAM: Wow, very funny. 
PAM: Wow, was it the age difference? 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. 
PAM: Wow. He is officially the worst human being. 
PAM: Wow. Look at our parking lot. 
PAM: Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you. 
PAM: Wow. That was... wow. 
PAM: Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever. 
PAM: Wow... 
PAM: Wow... I-- 
PAM: Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh. 
PAM: Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom. 
PAM: Yay, Grandma! 
PAM: Yea. Yea no problem.  
PAM: Yeah exactly. It's my turn. 
PAM: Yeah he does. 
PAM: Yeah-- it's exciting. 
PAM: Yeah probably. Hey, Michael? 
PAM: Yeah turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again those are the wipers. So the its just. There you go! Yeah.  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids red light that it's nice to have that creative outlet red light! Red light! Red! Red! 
PAM: Yeah! 
PAM: Yeah! 
PAM: Yeah! 
PAM: Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier. 
PAM: Yeah! Whoo!  
PAM: Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts. 
PAM: Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed? 
PAM: Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this. 
PAM: Yeah, are you coming out now? 
PAM: Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down. 
PAM: Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great. 
PAM: Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes. 
PAM: Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge. 
PAM: Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing. 
PAM: Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping. 
PAM: Yeah, but this is different. 
PAM: Yeah, but we don't have a power cord. 
PAM: Yeah, but you have to calm... 
PAM: Yeah, do you need a hand?  
PAM: Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight. 
PAM: Yeah, Freecell. 
PAM: Yeah, go away.  
PAM: Yeah, great. 
PAM: Yeah, he came and went. 
PAM: Yeah, he is. 
PAM: Yeah, he is. 
PAM: Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week. 
PAM: Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, "These people are my friends." But he's all like, "This is confidential. You can't tell anybody." But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything. 
PAM: Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though? 
PAM: Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh?  Let's get you into a tub. 
PAM: Yeah, I can make you a list. 
PAM: Yeah, I changed them to your new address. 
PAM: Yeah, I could read it. 
PAM: Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks. 
PAM: Yeah, I do. 
PAM: Yeah, I gave him a ride home because... 
PAM: Yeah, I gave it to you. 
PAM: Yeah, I get to do this like, every week. 
PAM: Yeah, I guess I could. 
PAM: Yeah, I guess, since I won. 
PAM: Yeah, I guess. 
PAM: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate. 
PAM: Yeah, I haven't asked him yet. 
PAM: Yeah, I know what a loft is. 
PAM: Yeah, I know. 
PAM: Yeah, I love it! 
PAM: Yeah, I m fine. 
PAM: Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step! 
PAM: Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you. 
PAM: Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff. 
PAM: Yeah, I think I made the right choice. 
PAM: Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together. 
PAM: Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital. 
PAM: Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on. 
PAM: Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me. 
PAM: Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home. 
PAM: Yeah, I'll take it.  
PAM: Yeah, I'm glad you said something. 
PAM: Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames.  I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited. 
PAM: Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones. 
PAM: Yeah, I'm okay. 
PAM: Yeah, is that a new tie? 
PAM: Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great. 
PAM: Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws. 
PAM: Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do. 
PAM: Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural- 
PAM: Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it. 
PAM: Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today. 
PAM: Yeah, know what? 
PAM: Yeah, like Harry Potter. 
PAM: Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too. 
PAM: Yeah, maybe. 
PAM: Yeah, me too. 
PAM: Yeah, mostly. 
PAM: Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room. 
PAM: Yeah, OK then. 
PAM: Yeah, okay, I m sorry. I m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it. 
PAM: Yeah, right. 
PAM: Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever. 
PAM: Yeah, right? 
PAM: Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this. 
PAM: Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time. 
PAM: Yeah, she just went down. 
PAM: Yeah, some days I never go outside. 
PAM: Yeah, something like that. 
PAM: Yeah, sounds good. Ok. 
PAM: Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right? 
PAM: Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend. 
PAM: Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police. 
PAM: Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding? 
PAM: Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the- 
PAM: Yeah, they're really great together. 
PAM: Yeah, totally. So... 
PAM: Yeah, wasn't that neat? 
PAM: Yeah, we call it White Elephant. 
PAM: Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum. 
PAM: Yeah, we should do that for real sometime. 
PAM: Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right? 
PAM: Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one. 
PAM: Yeah, well, get used to it, bud. 
PAM: Yeah, well, that'll happen. 
PAM: Yeah, what happened Dwight? 
PAM: Yeah, whatever.   Give it to me. Give it to me. 
PAM: Yeah, what's that? 
PAM: Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So... Pam's 
PAM: Yeah, yeah, no, no. It s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can t do if you just keep singing  Monster Mash.  
PAM: Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses "Doors closed" the doors open. Or he presses "lobby" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that? 
PAM: Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it. 
PAM: Yeah, you don't grab these   for balance. 
PAM: Yeah, you too. 
PAM: Yeah, you're gonna need it. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah.  
PAM: Yeah.   
PAM: Yeah.  Oh we're in last place. 
PAM: Yeah. "I vant to count to ten". 
PAM: Yeah. And he has saggy boobs. 
PAM: Yeah. And he worked here too. 
PAM: Yeah. Are you ready? 
PAM: Yeah. Can I fill out an application? Graphics 
PAM: Yeah. 'Cause you said I didn't 
PAM: Yeah. Coward. 
PAM: Yeah. Do you think she's hot? 
PAM: Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk.  Oh my God. 
PAM: Yeah. Good. 
PAM: Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best. 
PAM: Yeah. He works here. We all know him. 
PAM: Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00. 
PAM: Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second? 
PAM: Yeah. I feel better. 
PAM: Yeah. I have my copies.   
PAM: Yeah. I know, me too. 
PAM: Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks. 
PAM: Yeah. I m afraid he s only gonna have hot dogs. 
PAM: Yeah. I mean, listen if we re gonna do this thing, we should do it right. 
PAM: Yeah. I think maybe I want a "wedding" wedding. 
PAM: Yeah. I think you should call social services. 
PAM: Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye.  Come on.  Party 
PAM: Yeah. I'm excited to start the company. 
PAM: Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area. Pam's 
PAM: Yeah. It's kinda crazy. 
PAM: Yeah. It's really ugly 
PAM: Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend. 
PAM: Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore. 
PAM: Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred. 
PAM: Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way. 
PAM: Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that... 
PAM: Yeah. Sorry. 
PAM: Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid? 
PAM: Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note? 
PAM: Yeah. Way too much. 
PAM: Yeah. What? Us? 
PAM: Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three. 
PAM: Yeah... 
PAM: Yeah... 
PAM: Yeah...  Hey, Erin, everything okay? 
PAM: Yeah... That was um... 
PAM: Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know. 
PAM: Yeah? 
PAM: Yeah? 
PAM: Yeah? 
PAM: Yeah? 
PAM: Yeah? 
PAM: Yeah? 
PAM: Yeah? 
PAM: Yeah? 
PAM: Yeah?  It was though, that's what happened. 
PAM: Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time. 
PAM: Yep, good. 
PAM: Yep, super lucky. 
PAM: Yep, that, yeah. 
PAM: Yep, that's the Dwight I need. 
PAM: Yep. 
PAM: Yep. 
PAM: Yep. 
PAM: Yep. 
PAM: Yep. 
PAM: Yep. 
PAM: Yep. 
PAM: Yep. 
PAM: Yep. I ll talk to you tomorrow. 
PAM: Yep. Lucked out. 
PAM: Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine. 
PAM: Yes I did. 
PAM: Yes it's too tight. 
PAM: Yes! 
PAM: Yes! 
PAM: Yes! 
PAM: Yes! 
PAM: Yes! 
PAM: Yes!   
PAM: Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week. 
PAM: Yes! I have been so authorized. 
PAM: Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back. 
PAM: Yes! Oh!  Um, congratulations to you, sir.  
PAM: Yes! Phyllis! 
PAM: Yes! Thank you, welcome to my personal hell! 
PAM: Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together. 
PAM: Yes, after my grandfather. 
PAM: Yes, and then we decided that was crazy. 
PAM: Yes, and there s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it. 
PAM: Yes, because she's hot, right? 
PAM: Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting. 
PAM: Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy. 
PAM: Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back. 
PAM: Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription. 
PAM: Yes, I did. 
PAM: Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse.  
PAM: Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that. 
PAM: Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set. 
PAM: Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different. 
PAM: Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead. 
PAM: Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye. 
PAM: Yes, it was. 
PAM: Yes, it's totally obvious. 
PAM: Yes, Jim s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college. 
PAM: Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something. 
PAM: Yes, let's go.  
PAM: Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year. 
PAM: Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball. 
PAM: Yes, please. 
PAM: Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go! 
PAM: Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request. 
PAM: Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip. 
PAM: Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink. 
PAM: Yes, you have very nice teeth. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Yes. Absolutely. Right away. 
PAM: Yes. And I think they gave him too many fries. 
PAM: Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year. 
PAM: Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to- 
PAM: Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember. 
PAM: Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was- 
PAM: Yes. He was a good spy. 
PAM: Yes. In my top three, so suck it. 
PAM: Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it. 
PAM: Yes. Never found that bottom, did we? 
PAM: Yes. Or come in. 
PAM: Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby! 
PAM: Yes. Tattoo 
PAM: Yes. Thank you, mom. 
PAM: Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question. 
PAM: Yes. Yeah. 
PAM: Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim. 
PAM: Yes. Yes, it's possible. 
PAM: Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes. 
PAM: Yes... nice! I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner. 
PAM: Yes? Hospital 
PAM: Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting.   
PAM: You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding. 
PAM: You are never going to be my father, you get out! 
PAM: You are? 
PAM: You blew the sale, you idiot. 
PAM: You bought me a house! 
PAM: You called the meeting I don't.. 
PAM: You came in at 10:30 today, right? 
PAM: You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired. 
PAM: You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party. 
PAM: You can do that? 
PAM: You can do this. 
PAM: You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together? 
PAM: You can have your snack in here. 
PAM: You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving. 
PAM: You can try mine. 
PAM: You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael. 
PAM: You can't do that. 
PAM: You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here. 
PAM: You can't leave anyone out. 
PAM: You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left. 
PAM: You could have just told us what you were thinking. 
PAM: You could start by concluding this meeting. 
PAM: You dare me? How old are you? 
PAM: You did good, Dwight. It s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan s not normal. Let s just go. She s not going to sell to us. 
PAM: You did it. 
PAM: You did what? 
PAM: You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael? 
PAM: You didn't have any. 
PAM: You didn't say anything to me? 
PAM: You didn't see it? 
PAM: You didn't think to mention me huh? 
PAM: You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party. 
PAM: You do. 
PAM: You don t remember? 
PAM: You don't find Cathy attractive? 
PAM: You don't have anything you're doing? 
PAM: You don't have to do that, Kevin. 
PAM: You don't have to do that. 
PAM: You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out. 
PAM: You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager. 
PAM: You don't? 
PAM: You doubt it? 
PAM: You dream in cartoons? How fun! 
PAM: You feel OK now? 
PAM: You finished the movie. 
PAM: You get paid by the year at the bowling alley? 
PAM: You got a fax. 
PAM: You got a second? 
PAM: You guys are stripes, I think... 
PAM: You guys do a raffle? 
PAM: You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that... 
PAM: You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life. 
PAM: You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging. 
PAM: You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place... 
PAM: You had to be there. 
PAM: You have a computer Andy. 
PAM: You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar. 
PAM: You have a gun in your desk? 
PAM: You have no idea... 
PAM: You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish. 
PAM: You have to go? 
PAM: You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families! 
PAM: You have to settle down first. 
PAM: You have to tell me now. 
PAM: You have to tell them. 
PAM: You haven't told me. 
PAM: You headed out? 
PAM: You hit her? 
PAM: You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her. 
PAM: You just said that we're gonna be gone...? 
PAM: You just still have these messages from yesterday. 
PAM: You know it s just herbal tea. 
PAM: You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box! 
PAM: You know the baby's not going to live here, right? 
PAM: You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you. 
PAM: You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk. 
PAM: You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay? 
PAM: You know what, I think we should get some other input. 
PAM: You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you. 
PAM: You know what? I-- I-- I don t think you want to start a conversation with me about what s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever -- 
PAM: You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two. 
PAM: You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there. 
PAM: You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me! 
PAM: You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. 
PAM: You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine.  
PAM: You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding. 
PAM: You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'. 
PAM: You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy.  Coming! 
PAM: You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today. 
PAM: You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with- 
PAM: You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.

PASTOR: Christening calls to repentance, to faithfulness, and to discipleship. We've come to celebrate these babies.

PETE: Alice. Oh man. 
PETE: All right, all right.Okay, start over. 
PETE: All right.

PETE: Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'. 
PETE: Alright? I'll be in the annex. 
PETE: And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets. 
PETE: Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap. 
PETE: Andy, that is really inappropriate. 
PETE: Andy. 
PETE: Andy.

PETE: Did she buy it? 
PETE: Die hard reference. 
PETE: Douche. 
PETE: Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy. 
PETE: Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved. 
PETE: Erin! Erin! Just stop. 
PETE: Erin, did this call... 
PETE: Fax? 
PETE: Fine. 
PETE: Fonas chek! 
PETE: For a long time, Andy. 
PETE: For insulting a client s recently deceased mother. 
PETE: Hear what? 
PETE: Hey Erin! 
PETE: Hey, did Erin already take off? 
PETE: Hey, hey, hey, it s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That s what this tower s all about -- mistakes. Okay, if you re afraid of screwing up, the tower s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in? 
PETE: Hey, just having fun Jimmy. 
PETE: Hey, look who it is! 
PETE: Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper. 
PETE: Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team. 
PETE: Hey, you OK? 
PETE: Hey. 
PETE: Hey. 
PETE: Hey. Everything okay? 
PETE: Hey. She's back. 
PETE: Hey. You got a sec to talk? 
PETE: I didn t realize that everybody here dresses up every year. 
PETE: I do think we can have a fair.... 
PETE: I don t want it, really. 
PETE: I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men. 
PETE: I don't think that's Nelly. 
PETE: I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man.  
PETE: I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car. 
PETE: I think this is better. 
PETE: I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night. 
PETE: I was just leaving. 
PETE: If you want to talk to me 
PETE: I'll be in the annex. 
PETE: I'll get my coat. 
PETE: I'm just calling it like I see it. 
PETE: I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses. 
PETE: I'm trying.. 
PETE: It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived. 
PETE: It is so unpleasant. You? 
PETE: It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete. 
PETE: It s cool, man. I m sure you and I will have our own thing. 
PETE: It was college. That is what you do. 
PETE: It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind. 
PETE: I've got the seat adjusted right. 
PETE: Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong? 
PETE: Kevin, I can hear you. 
PETE: Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh! 
PETE: Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and-- 
PETE: Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her? 
PETE: My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it. 
PETE: NASCAR. The Amazing Race. 
PETE: Nice to see you again, Pam. 
PETE: Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex. 
PETE: No I m not. 
PETE: No thank you. My name s Pete. 
PETE: No! 
PETE: No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them. 
PETE: No, it actually feels kinda nice. 
PETE: No, that's the-- 
PETE: No. 
PETE: Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera. 
PETE: Oh my god. 
PETE: Oh okay. Sorry. 
PETE: Oh sorry! Sorry. 
PETE: Oh yeah. 
PETE: Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific. 
PETE: Oh, check it out. This is our first real  Like.  
PETE: Oh, I m sorry. It s for the thing. 
PETE: Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind? 
PETE: Oh, no, no, no. No it s cool. 
PETE: Oh, that's okay, bud. 
PETE: Oh, yeah, of course. I know. 
PETE: Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK?  
PETE: Oh. 
PETE: Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk. 
PETE: Ok  Hey hey hey, whoa. 
PETE: Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got. 
PETE: Ok. 
PETE: Ok. 
PETE: Okay, call down. It s just me, not Tom Selleck. Guys in 
PETE: Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy? 
PETE: Okay. 
PETE: Okay. 
PETE: Okay. 
PETE: One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to  chillax,  and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. Fight the power. 
PETE: Or we can just sit and talk, though. 
PETE: Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert... 
PETE: Pete! 
PETE: Plop? Still? 
PETE: Poor Angela. 
PETE: Really? I got something? 
PETE: Relax. 
PETE: Right, um, okay. So he says, uh,  "After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--" 
PETE: See ya later, Heymont. 
PETE: See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward. 
PETE: Seems unnecessary for an audition. 
PETE: She's nice to me. 
PETE: Smoking. 
PETE: Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know.  
PETE: Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied. 
PETE: Sure, boxing, tennis. 
PETE: That Clark, huh? Errr  Ca! 
PETE: That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from? 
PETE: That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes. 
PETE: That s really nice. 
PETE: That s the idea. 
PETE: That was killer. I was so close to blowing it. 
PETE: That, is awesome! 
PETE: That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend? 
PETE: The point is Pam, is there are jobs- 
PETE: The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone. 
PETE: Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them  Like  Derek s  Likes.  
PETE: There he is! 
PETE: There we go. 
PETE: There we go. All right, let s do it.

PETE: Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life. 
PETE: Well, I m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list. 
PETE: Well, I ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher. 
PETE: Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now. 
PETE: Well, okay, then. 
PETE: Well. Is it?

PHYLLIS:  What does it say? 
PHYLLIS:  Who takes a kid to Mexico? 
PHYLLIS:  Who's that? 
PHYLLIS:  Woooooow. 
PHYLLIS:  Yeah, we really did peel your grapes. 
PHYLLIS:  Yeah. 
PHYLLIS:  Yeah. 
PHYLLIS:  Yes. 
PHYLLIS:  You deserve it. 
PHYLLIS:  You want the 27-26 or the 27-30? 
PHYLLIS: "It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy." 
PHYLLIS: . Andy  
PHYLLIS: ...and a big walk-in closet. 
PHYLLIS: ...report you to HR. 
PHYLLIS: A furnace? 
PHYLLIS: A lot of mines in Scranton. 
PHYLLIS: A restaurant. 
PHYLLIS: Afghani. 
PHYLLIS: Afghani. 
PHYLLIS: After 16 years, it s strange sitting across from somebody who isn t Stanley. But he ll get there. 
PHYLLIS: Again with the cousin. 
PHYLLIS: Ahhh!  
PHYLLIS: All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand? 
PHYLLIS: All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer. 
PHYLLIS: An asset! 
PHYLLIS: An hour? I can't stay here an hour. 
PHYLLIS: An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy. Bob 
PHYLLIS: And I imagine things are starting to heat up? 
PHYLLIS: And it didn't change your mind. 
PHYLLIS: And napkins... fanned. 
PHYLLIS: And this brings us to you, little one. 
PHYLLIS: And when you fell in, did you flounder? 
PHYLLIS: Andy He's gone. 
PHYLLIS: Andy sings beautifully. And he s really good at dancing. He s a good speaker. But there s just something there you don t want to look at. 
PHYLLIS: Andy! 
PHYLLIS: Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families? 
PHYLLIS: Andy, don t make us sell this stupid thing. 
PHYLLIS: Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping. 
PHYLLIS: Andy, I think Jim is messing with you. 
PHYLLIS: Andy, I ve been worried about you. How are you? 
PHYLLIS: Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client. 
PHYLLIS: Andy. 
PHYLLIS: Andy's running over Dwight with his car. 
PHYLLIS: Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw. So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this.  So we're gonna try out some new things today. 
PHYLLIS: Angela s special repairman is here. 
PHYLLIS: Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite. 
PHYLLIS: Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme. 
PHYLLIS: Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk. 
PHYLLIS: Are you alright? 
PHYLLIS: Are you calling me a ho? 
PHYLLIS: Are you glad to be back? 
PHYLLIS: Are you gonna give me the leads or not? 
PHYLLIS: Are you good at homemade? 
PHYLLIS: Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed. 
PHYLLIS: As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one. 
PHYLLIS: Ass. 
PHYLLIS: Aw, what the hell?   Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in? 
PHYLLIS: Awww, it's kissing its mommy! 
PHYLLIS: Back! 
PHYLLIS: Backups.  
PHYLLIS: Bestiality. Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene. 
PHYLLIS: Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour. 
PHYLLIS: Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once.  
PHYLLIS: Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy. 
PHYLLIS: Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine. 
PHYLLIS: Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up. 
PHYLLIS: But I didn't report your snoring- 
PHYLLIS: But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here? 
PHYLLIS: But the rattler's so scary. 
PHYLLIS: But we invited guests. 
PHYLLIS: But where would we...go? 
PHYLLIS: But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour. 
PHYLLIS: But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out. 
PHYLLIS: Bye everyone. 
PHYLLIS: C mon, just say you saw the list by accident. 
PHYLLIS: C.C 
PHYLLIS: Cake. 
PHYLLIS: Call a doctor. 
PHYLLIS: Call us when you get there so we know you're OK.  
PHYLLIS: Can I get a list of your vendors? 
PHYLLIS: Church isn't a party, Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Clark! 
PHYLLIS: Close your mouth, sweetie. You look like a trout. 
PHYLLIS: Cold, huh? 
PHYLLIS: Come on Andy, they're a good match. 
PHYLLIS: Come on! This isn't fair! 
PHYLLIS: Come on, Bob. Raise your hand.   
PHYLLIS: Come on, Dwight, you're making this up. 
PHYLLIS: Come on, Pam. 
PHYLLIS: Completely. 
PHYLLIS: Congratulations! 
PHYLLIS: Cookies? 
PHYLLIS: Cool. 
PHYLLIS: Damn. 
PHYLLIS: Dancing babies! 
PHYLLIS: David Wallace called this meeting? 
PHYLLIS: Definitely Jim. 
PHYLLIS: Did the police solve the problem with the... 
PHYLLIS: Did you even try? 
PHYLLIS: Did you get any clients back? 
PHYLLIS: Did you have a nice drive in? 
PHYLLIS: Did you plan it? 
PHYLLIS: Did you see... 
PHYLLIS: Did you send him to the slammer? 
PHYLLIS: Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em. 
PHYLLIS: Disgusting... 
PHYLLIS: Do you have a black eye? 
PHYLLIS: Do you have a pole? 
PHYLLIS: Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here? 
PHYLLIS: Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then? 
PHYLLIS: Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance? 
PHYLLIS: Does it hurt terribly? 
PHYLLIS: Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X? 
PHYLLIS: Don t you have any sunblock? 
PHYLLIS: Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive. 
PHYLLIS: Dwight is our new boss. 
PHYLLIS: Dwight said it's "Hog maw." 
PHYLLIS: Dwight!  
PHYLLIS: Dwight! Dwight! 
PHYLLIS: Dwight, get out of here! 
PHYLLIS: Dwight, get out of here!!  
PHYLLIS: Dwight, stop it. 
PHYLLIS: Dwight, you can t go. You have a problem with women. You can t sell to them. 
PHYLLIS: Dwight... 
PHYLLIS: Dwight? 
PHYLLIS: Eight Cases, bright white inkjet. 
PHYLLIS: Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he s gone for who knows how long. 
PHYLLIS: Eleven, wow! 
PHYLLIS: Elliot. 
PHYLLIS: Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now? 
PHYLLIS: Excuse me? 
PHYLLIS: Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts.  But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads. 
PHYLLIS: First message 
PHYLLIS: For your signature.  
PHYLLIS: Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest? 
PHYLLIS: Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done.  
PHYLLIS: Found him! 
PHYLLIS: Four. 
PHYLLIS: Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her  gy-na  for your entire meeting. 
PHYLLIS: Go get 'em Dwight. 
PHYLLIS: Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for. 
PHYLLIS: Good luck! 
PHYLLIS: Good night, Andy. 
PHYLLIS: Good. Good. 
PHYLLIS: Goodnight Pam.  
PHYLLIS: Got it. 
PHYLLIS: Guys, we can t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back. 
PHYLLIS: He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me. 
PHYLLIS: He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch. 
PHYLLIS: He does have a moustache. 
PHYLLIS: He means the ice pack. 
PHYLLIS: He needs to rest. 
PHYLLIS: He should pay. 
PHYLLIS: Hello Angela. 
PHYLLIS: Hello. 
PHYLLIS: Helpless. 
PHYLLIS: Her hair looks beautiful. 
PHYLLIS: Here's her carrier, but no Cece. Jim's 
PHYLLIS: He's a real catch and you should take him back. 
PHYLLIS: He's always been terrible with money. 
PHYLLIS: He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy. 
PHYLLIS: Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water? 
PHYLLIS: Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again. 
PHYLLIS: Hey! 
PHYLLIS: Hey! 
PHYLLIS: Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts? 
PHYLLIS: Hey, how's Annie? 
PHYLLIS: Hey, I hear Jim's coming back. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures? 
PHYLLIS: Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce.  Okay. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, this is your apology letter. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, where s my ring? 
PHYLLIS: Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me? We'll take all afternoon.   Michael is terrified of bob. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, you two having fun? 
PHYLLIS: Hey. I like. 
PHYLLIS: Hi guys. 
PHYLLIS: Hi Michael.  Mm. 'kay. 
PHYLLIS: Hi sweetie. 
PHYLLIS: Hi. 
PHYLLIS: Hi. 
PHYLLIS: Hi. 
PHYLLIS: Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines? Woman over 
PHYLLIS: Hillary Swank. 
PHYLLIS: Hit it, red!  
PHYLLIS: Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes.  
PHYLLIS: Hmm. 
PHYLLIS: Hmm? 
PHYLLIS: Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob. 
PHYLLIS: Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year - 
PHYLLIS: Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus! 
PHYLLIS: Holy crap. 
PHYLLIS: Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk. 
PHYLLIS: How do you know it's a gun? 
PHYLLIS: How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there? 
PHYLLIS: How far along is Pam? 
PHYLLIS: How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back? 
PHYLLIS: How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible? 
PHYLLIS: How much wine do you have? 
PHYLLIS: How was jury duty? 
PHYLLIS: How's your hearing? 
PHYLLIS: I actually sleep better when it's raining. 
PHYLLIS: I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy. 
PHYLLIS: I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y. 
PHYLLIS: I am clicking. 
PHYLLIS: I am jumping. 
PHYLLIS: I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan? 
PHYLLIS: I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs. 
PHYLLIS: I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club. 
PHYLLIS: I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad. 
PHYLLIS: I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her. 
PHYLLIS: I can't feel my toes. 
PHYLLIS: I can't see half of the things.  
PHYLLIS: I could try to seduce him. 
PHYLLIS: I couldn't see your hands.  Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK? 
PHYLLIS: I did. 
PHYLLIS: I didn't ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be. 
PHYLLIS: I didn't really get a good look. 
PHYLLIS: I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine. 
PHYLLIS: I do. 
PHYLLIS: I do. 
PHYLLIS: I don t think I should walk anymore. You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast. Two poached eggs. And then half a sandwich on the bus. 
PHYLLIS: I don't care what she's doing. I just hope she keeps doing it. 
PHYLLIS: I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise. 
PHYLLIS: I don't get it. 
PHYLLIS: I don't have that, Dwight. 
PHYLLIS: I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India. 
PHYLLIS: I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I... 
PHYLLIS: I don't know, they're both handsome. 
PHYLLIS: I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that... 
PHYLLIS: I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone. 
PHYLLIS: I don't think he'd do that. 
PHYLLIS: I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her. 
PHYLLIS: I guess so... 
PHYLLIS: I guess we could give them some of our new commissions. 
PHYLLIS: I have a friend who's single. 
PHYLLIS: I have a new swimsuit I need to break in.... 
PHYLLIS: I have a sports bra. 
PHYLLIS: I have an ace. 
PHYLLIS: I have an ice cream cake in the car. 
PHYLLIS: I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it.  It's been a long journey... but  I'm Santa Claus! 
PHYLLIS: I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it. 
PHYLLIS: I have ears, Dwight. 
PHYLLIS: I have my hug. 
PHYLLIS: I hope he's ok, I feel bad. 
PHYLLIS: I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works. 
PHYLLIS: I knitted it for you. 
PHYLLIS: I know 
PHYLLIS: I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right? 
PHYLLIS: I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting. 
PHYLLIS: I know, Kevin. 
PHYLLIS: I know. I thought you two were nice together. 
PHYLLIS: I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it? 
PHYLLIS: I like her purple dress. 
PHYLLIS: I ll try this one. 
PHYLLIS: I love their breadsticks! 
PHYLLIS: I m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down. 
PHYLLIS: I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go? 
PHYLLIS: I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today. I'm really happy being here. 
PHYLLIS: I need you to get rid of the tree. 
PHYLLIS: I need you to put the Christmas tree back up. 
PHYLLIS: I never see him drink. I never see him eat. 
PHYLLIS: I say no. 
PHYLLIS: I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on. 
PHYLLIS: I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary.   
PHYLLIS: I think he- 
PHYLLIS: I think he left. 
PHYLLIS: I think I just got flashed. 
PHYLLIS: I think it's a fun idea. 
PHYLLIS: I think it's gonna be Michael. 
PHYLLIS: I think it's good. 
PHYLLIS: I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife. 
PHYLLIS: I think you look nice. 
PHYLLIS: I think you're remembering that wrong? 
PHYLLIS: I thought he knew about the baby I gave away. 
PHYLLIS: I thought it was... 
PHYLLIS: I thought maybe DJ's. 
PHYLLIS: I thought Terry knew about Cynthia? 
PHYLLIS: I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree. 
PHYLLIS: I thought you said green was whorish. 
PHYLLIS: I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone. 
PHYLLIS: I was just getting a snack. 
PHYLLIS: I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind. 
PHYLLIS: I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate.   I don't think they're appropriate anymore. 
PHYLLIS: I was... 
PHYLLIS: I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs. 
PHYLLIS: I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them. 
PHYLLIS: I... twisted it. 
PHYLLIS: I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school. 
PHYLLIS: I'd rather have the bowl. 
PHYLLIS: If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure? 
PHYLLIS: If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there. 
PHYLLIS: If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four. 
PHYLLIS: If my daughter were asking me...  
PHYLLIS: If you're just handing them out, I want one too. 
PHYLLIS: I'll do it. 
PHYLLIS: I'll do it. 
PHYLLIS: I'll see what I can find out. 
PHYLLIS: I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata. 
PHYLLIS: I'll talk to her, Michael. 
PHYLLIS: I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy. 
PHYLLIS: I'm excited about today.  I love girl talk. 
PHYLLIS: I'm getting married to Bob Vance. 
PHYLLIS: I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid. 
PHYLLIS: I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that. 
PHYLLIS: I'm good baby.  
PHYLLIS: I'm in too. 
PHYLLIS: I'm just saying hi to Bob. 
PHYLLIS: I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't. 
PHYLLIS: I'm out too. 
PHYLLIS: I'm really sorry. It was earlier today. 
PHYLLIS: I'm sitting right here Dwight. 
PHYLLIS: I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her. 
PHYLLIS: I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful. 
PHYLLIS: I'm sorry, 
PHYLLIS: I'm sorry, everybody. 
PHYLLIS: I'm sorry. It's the largest one I have. 
PHYLLIS: I'm the same age as you, Michael. 
PHYLLIS: In our neighborhood... 
PHYLLIS: In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin!  
PHYLLIS: In the parking lot. 
PHYLLIS: Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager? 
PHYLLIS: Is it true you're buying the company? 
PHYLLIS: Is she Asian? 
PHYLLIS: Is that Cici? 
PHYLLIS: Is that ladle stainless or... 
PHYLLIS: Is there any mustard? 
PHYLLIS: Isn't he sweet? 
PHYLLIS: Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them? That I didn't have enough time for them? 
PHYLLIS: Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes? 
PHYLLIS: It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much. 
PHYLLIS: It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was. 
PHYLLIS: It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley. 
PHYLLIS: It is so nice to go out with another couple. 
PHYLLIS: It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party. 
PHYLLIS: It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone. Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them. 
PHYLLIS: It looks pretty black. 
PHYLLIS: It s just the wind. 
PHYLLIS: It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now? 
PHYLLIS: It sure looked good on the mannequin. 
PHYLLIS: It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child. 
PHYLLIS: It'll be all right. 
PHYLLIS: It's a big order. Thanks Kenny. 
PHYLLIS: It's a combo dance house coffee bar. 
PHYLLIS: It's a secret. 
PHYLLIS: It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool. 
PHYLLIS: It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet. 
PHYLLIS: It's cute.  
PHYLLIS: It's fish. 
PHYLLIS: It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good! 
PHYLLIS: It's going well. 
PHYLLIS: It's just me here. 
PHYLLIS: It's labeled. 
PHYLLIS: It's my back. 
PHYLLIS: It's nice to learn new things. 
PHYLLIS: It's nice, like Up. 
PHYLLIS: It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients. 
PHYLLIS: It's not like you can fire people or anything. 
PHYLLIS: It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning! 
PHYLLIS: It's really cute. 
PHYLLIS: It's really something. 
PHYLLIS: It's the lining of the stomach of-- 
PHYLLIS: It's the only gavel I could find. 
PHYLLIS: It's unbelievable! 
PHYLLIS: It's, it's fine. 
PHYLLIS: Jim was supposed to collect it. 
PHYLLIS: Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's so romantic. 
PHYLLIS: Jim's gonna love it.  
PHYLLIS: Just go. 
PHYLLIS: Keep me out of it. 
PHYLLIS: Kevin, take your shoes off first! 
PHYLLIS: Know what? 
PHYLLIS: Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars. 
PHYLLIS: Let me get you some water. 
PHYLLIS: Let me help you us. 
PHYLLIS: Let's do it! 
PHYLLIS: Live and learn. 
PHYLLIS: Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby. Sheet cake. 
PHYLLIS: Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy. 
PHYLLIS: Look, I don t feel safe. I think we should call the police. 
PHYLLIS: Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again? 
PHYLLIS: Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining? 
PHYLLIS: Lose the twirl. 
PHYLLIS: Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson s a mean old grump.  But  would a grump make this? It s me. It s me. 
PHYLLIS: Lots of things are cozy in the rain. 
PHYLLIS: Luke? Luke! 
PHYLLIS: Made love? I don't know. 
PHYLLIS: Magical... 
PHYLLIS: Make them kiss each other. 
PHYLLIS: Maybe I'll quit. 
PHYLLIS: Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there? 
PHYLLIS: Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading. 
PHYLLIS: Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients. 
PHYLLIS: Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited. 
PHYLLIS: Michael! 
PHYLLIS: Michael! Come on! 
PHYLLIS: Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond? 
PHYLLIS: Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, I was doing so well. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, just give us our clients back. That's all we care about. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, that's awful. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, we have a lot of work to do. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you? 
PHYLLIS: Michael, what will you do? 
PHYLLIS: Michael, why would we all go to the dump? 
PHYLLIS: Michael, you always said we were a family. Then you went after us. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, you make fun of us every day. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, you should stay home and rest. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt. You should be apologizing to us. 
PHYLLIS: Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Michael.  
PHYLLIS: Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby? 
PHYLLIS: Michael...  
PHYLLIS: Michael... No. 
PHYLLIS: Michael? 
PHYLLIS: Mistake. 
PHYLLIS: Mm. 
PHYLLIS: Mm. I like your shoes.   
PHYLLIS: Mm-hmm, near the river. 
PHYLLIS: Mm-hmm. 
PHYLLIS: Mm-hmm. 
PHYLLIS: Mm-hmm.   
PHYLLIS: Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake. 
PHYLLIS: Mmm, whatcha got? 
PHYLLIS: Mmm-hmm. 
PHYLLIS: Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck. 
PHYLLIS: Move on, Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Ms. Thomas, so good to see you. 
PHYLLIS: My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you? 
PHYLLIS: My mom taught me that. 
PHYLLIS: My perfume? 
PHYLLIS: Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know. 
PHYLLIS: Never mind, I shouldn't have said that. 
PHYLLIS: No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs. 
PHYLLIS: No Bob, we worked it out. 
PHYLLIS: No way. 
PHYLLIS: No we re not. 
PHYLLIS: No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat. 
PHYLLIS: No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one. 
PHYLLIS: No, he s good. 
PHYLLIS: No, hey, Dwight shouldn t... 
PHYLLIS: No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close. 
PHYLLIS: No, I think they mean more like a politician. 
PHYLLIS: No, it's 4:35. 
PHYLLIS: No, it's lettuce. 
PHYLLIS: No, just go home. 
PHYLLIS: No, she is the boss. 
PHYLLIS: No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going. 
PHYLLIS: No, the one before that. 
PHYLLIS: No, there s wine in here. 
PHYLLIS: No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day.  
PHYLLIS: No, you knew me in high school. Course, we all thought you were gay in high school. 
PHYLLIS: No. 
PHYLLIS: No. 
PHYLLIS: No. 
PHYLLIS: No. 
PHYLLIS: No.  I'm on a sale! 
PHYLLIS: No. Call Bob. 
PHYLLIS: No. Jim...  
PHYLLIS: No. Sorry. 
PHYLLIS: No..we don't 
PHYLLIS: Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb. 
PHYLLIS: Not according to the beans. 
PHYLLIS: Now this is getting ridiculous. 
PHYLLIS: Now you move on. 
PHYLLIS: Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys. 
PHYLLIS: Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical. 
PHYLLIS: Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't... 
PHYLLIS: Oh dear. 
PHYLLIS: Oh God. 
PHYLLIS: Oh I got the 'Save The Date'. 
PHYLLIS: Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held. 
PHYLLIS: Oh Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Oh no, they're still not done. 
PHYLLIS: Oh sure, a little piece. Ooh, no mushroom though. 
PHYLLIS: Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you! 
PHYLLIS: Oh!  
PHYLLIS: Oh! I forgot my purse. 
PHYLLIS: Oh! Mother ******! 
PHYLLIS: Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It s all garbage okay? You re the woman, I m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, are those your kids? They re so cute! They could be models. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, boy... 
PHYLLIS: Oh, boy... You... 
PHYLLIS: Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, dear. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, don't be such a baby. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I don't think it's blackmail. Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight. I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I don't think you're being silly. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I have a flush! 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I know I'd be more productive. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I'd love to but, um- 
PHYLLIS: Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I'll help you find it. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I'll just duck my head in. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results.  
PHYLLIS: Oh, it can be fun. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, it's coming. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly... 
PHYLLIS: Oh, Lord in heaven. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, ok. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, ok.   
PHYLLIS: Oh, really good, I went to Portugal. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, some fudge? 
PHYLLIS: Oh, sorry, it's your job. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, that's great news for your friend. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, the plants are gonna love this. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, we find little times during the day. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, we wouldn't. We love Stevie Wonder. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, you say that every time. 
PHYLLIS: Oh. 
PHYLLIS: Oh. 
PHYLLIS: Oh. 
PHYLLIS: Oh. 
PHYLLIS: Oh.  
PHYLLIS: Oh... 
PHYLLIS: Ohhh... 
PHYLLIS: Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people. 
PHYLLIS: OK. 
PHYLLIS: OK. 
PHYLLIS: OK. Packer can go to hell. Aunt 
PHYLLIS: Ok... nice. 
PHYLLIS: Okay that's enough. 
PHYLLIS: Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts? 
PHYLLIS: Okay, fine. Cash it is. 
PHYLLIS: Okay, forget it.  
PHYLLIS: Okay, let's do it. Bob 
PHYLLIS: Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day. 
PHYLLIS: Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It s hopeless. 
PHYLLIS: Okay, you just walked into her office and begin. 
PHYLLIS: Okay. 
PHYLLIS: Okay. 
PHYLLIS: Okay. 
PHYLLIS: Okay. 
PHYLLIS: Okay.   Angela's having sex with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party. 
PHYLLIS: Okay.  It s just the wind, see? Nothing. 
PHYLLIS: Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand. 
PHYLLIS: Okay...  
PHYLLIS: Okay...  
PHYLLIS: On more week.   
PHYLLIS: On purpose. 
PHYLLIS: One more, one more!  
PHYLLIS: One, two three!  
PHYLLIS: Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry. 
PHYLLIS: Ooh, why is it shaped like that? 
PHYLLIS: Ooh. 
PHYLLIS: Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless? 
PHYLLIS: Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that s Italian. 
PHYLLIS: Or should I have corndogs. I mean- 
PHYLLIS: Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your  boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness. 
PHYLLIS: Order carrot cake.  
PHYLLIS: Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that s-. 
PHYLLIS: Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more. 
PHYLLIS: Ow, my ankle! 
PHYLLIS: Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please?  
PHYLLIS: Pam. 
PHYLLIS: Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high.  
PHYLLIS: Perfect. I hate registries. 
PHYLLIS: Play it again. Promo 
PHYLLIS: Please Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Poor, poor Andy. 
PHYLLIS: Popcorn. 
PHYLLIS: Put it down 
PHYLLIS: Put it down. 
PHYLLIS: Really, Oh, they're from Bob again. 
PHYLLIS: Really? 
PHYLLIS: Really? 
PHYLLIS: Really? I thought they were pretty... 
PHYLLIS: Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five. 
PHYLLIS: Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live. 
PHYLLIS: Role call. 
PHYLLIS: Ryan, hand the phone over. 
PHYLLIS: Ryan. 
PHYLLIS: Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too. 
PHYLLIS: Say "Me eat cookie." 
PHYLLIS: See? 
PHYLLIS: Sexually? 
PHYLLIS: She does have very nice clothes. 
PHYLLIS: She just crossed her arms together... that's bad. 
PHYLLIS: She's not hot. 
PHYLLIS: She's out of your league Andy. 
PHYLLIS: She's real good. 
PHYLLIS: Sir, you have some messages. 
PHYLLIS: So he won't get caught! 
PHYLLIS: So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you - 
PHYLLIS: So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch? 
PHYLLIS: So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends. 
PHYLLIS: So is it an open relationship? 
PHYLLIS: So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal? 
PHYLLIS: So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore? 
PHYLLIS: So what does downsizing actually mean? 
PHYLLIS: So you went homemade this year. 
PHYLLIS: So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ? 
PHYLLIS: So, uh, show us how you d normally sell to a female client. 
PHYLLIS: So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes? 
PHYLLIS: Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn. 
PHYLLIS: Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here. 
PHYLLIS: Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real. 
PHYLLIS: Sorry. 
PHYLLIS: Sorry. Plastered. 
PHYLLIS: Sort of. He had a lot of clients. 
PHYLLIS: Split the commission? 
PHYLLIS: Stanley and I are close, too. 
PHYLLIS: Stanley!  
PHYLLIS: Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake. 
PHYLLIS: Stanley, you're dancing! 
PHYLLIS: Sure. 
PHYLLIS: Sure. 
PHYLLIS: Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there. 
PHYLLIS: Ten... 
PHYLLIS: Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts. 
PHYLLIS: Teri's out of town, Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Thank you, Dwight. These are nice. 
PHYLLIS: Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious. 
PHYLLIS: Thank you, Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Thank you. 
PHYLLIS: Thanks Angela. 
PHYLLIS: Thanks guys. 
PHYLLIS: Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside. 
PHYLLIS: Thanks. 
PHYLLIS: That can't be right. 
PHYLLIS: That feels good, Dwight. 
PHYLLIS: That must have been hard. 
PHYLLIS: That seemed to shut her up. 
PHYLLIS: That wasn't me. 
PHYLLIS: That's a halwa shabkia cookie. They serve it during Ramadan.   
PHYLLIS: That's a shame. Ed was a good guy. 
PHYLLIS: That's awful. 
PHYLLIS: That's fair. 
PHYLLIS: That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it.  
PHYLLIS: That's great! 
PHYLLIS: That's no pimple Michael. 
PHYLLIS: That's not a good idea, Michael. 
PHYLLIS: That's right. Yeah. Woman over 
PHYLLIS: That's still a lot of money! 
PHYLLIS: That's the character's name? 
PHYLLIS: That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.  
PHYLLIS: That's true. 
PHYLLIS: The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing. 
PHYLLIS: The mall itself or just the stores in the mall? 
PHYLLIS: The only Santa. 
PHYLLIS: The three of us have all been chairmen before. 
PHYLLIS: Then how is this "Amazing Race"? 
PHYLLIS: Then what was this all about? 
PHYLLIS: Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on. 
PHYLLIS: There was no client. Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone. 
PHYLLIS: There's always a theme. 
PHYLLIS: There's nothing to know, it's just gossip. 
PHYLLIS: They make you feel lighter... Woman over 
PHYLLIS: They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and- 
PHYLLIS: They're important. 
PHYLLIS: They're not getting married. It's just talk. 
PHYLLIS: This is really nice Dwight, thanks. 
PHYLLIS: This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here. 
PHYLLIS: This is stupid. 
PHYLLIS: This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee. The theme is "Nights in Morocco". This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party. Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate. 
PHYLLIS: This is weird. 
PHYLLIS: This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood! 
PHYLLIS: This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch! 
PHYLLIS: This says "Bushiest Beaver". 
PHYLLIS: Those sound too harsh. 
PHYLLIS: Told you so. 
PHYLLIS: Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago.  Tom?  Pow. 
PHYLLIS: Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks. 
PHYLLIS: Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested. 
PHYLLIS: Uh, on or off? I.D. 
PHYLLIS: Uh... 
PHYLLIS: Um, I had scoliosis as a girl. 
PHYLLIS: Um, let's see... it's fine. 
PHYLLIS: Um, The DaVinci Code. 
PHYLLIS: Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map. 
PHYLLIS: Um-hmmm. 
PHYLLIS: Umm I don't know Michael. 
PHYLLIS: Umm, no, she's a professional softball player. 
PHYLLIS: Unbelievable. 
PHYLLIS: Val. 
PHYLLIS: Wait .they re terrified? 
PHYLLIS: Wait, they have food there? 
PHYLLIS: Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time? 
PHYLLIS: Wait, what? 
PHYLLIS: Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it? 
PHYLLIS: Wait. This says  Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge ? 
PHYLLIS: Wanna dance, Dwight? 
PHYLLIS: Was there a fistfight? 
PHYLLIS: We already said no. 
PHYLLIS: We bury him? 
PHYLLIS: We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time. 
PHYLLIS: We did our best. 
PHYLLIS: We don t work for you! 
PHYLLIS: We don't feel that way. 
PHYLLIS: We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.  
PHYLLIS: We have a gym at home. It s called the bedroom. 
PHYLLIS: We have a right to know. 
PHYLLIS: We know the branch is closing; Michael told us. 
PHYLLIS: We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while. 
PHYLLIS: We re all a little hormonal with the doc airing. 
PHYLLIS: We re gonna cover for you, ya know. 
PHYLLIS: We started selling balloons. 
PHYLLIS: We think you made a big, big mistake. 
PHYLLIS: We-- we-- 
PHYLLIS: Welcome to your party. 
PHYLLIS: Well-- 
PHYLLIS: Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer. 
PHYLLIS: Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest. 
PHYLLIS: Well with your ties and your matching socks and --- 
PHYLLIS: Well, Andy s cute, but he s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird. 
PHYLLIS: Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you. 
PHYLLIS: Well, I guess that's not- 
PHYLLIS: Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us. 
PHYLLIS: Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful? 
PHYLLIS: Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it? 
PHYLLIS: Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it. 
PHYLLIS: Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them. 
PHYLLIS: Well, thanks. I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though. 
PHYLLIS: Well, there is a ball. 
PHYLLIS: Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red... 
PHYLLIS: Well, this could be fun. I- 
PHYLLIS: Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it. 
PHYLLIS: Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl. 
PHYLLIS: Well, we'll deal with it as it comes. 
PHYLLIS: Well, what about the other guys. 
PHYLLIS: Well? 
PHYLLIS: We're in the same High School class. 
PHYLLIS: We're not mocking, we're watching. 
PHYLLIS: We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen. 
PHYLLIS: We've been out here for a while. I don't need this. 
PHYLLIS: We-we found some wet cement in the park... 
PHYLLIS: What-- 
PHYLLIS: What are these for? 
PHYLLIS: What are you - 
PHYLLIS: What are you asking? 
PHYLLIS: What are you gonna do? 
PHYLLIS: What are you wearing? 
PHYLLIS: What are you? A monk? 
PHYLLIS: What consequences? 
PHYLLIS: What did we write? 
PHYLLIS: What did you do, Andy? 
PHYLLIS: What do we do? How do we stop this? 
PHYLLIS: What do you mean? 
PHYLLIS: What does that even mean? 
PHYLLIS: What does that even mean? 
PHYLLIS: What does that mean? 
PHYLLIS: What does the furnace do? 
PHYLLIS: What don't you get? 
PHYLLIS: What else you got? 
PHYLLIS: What in the name of God is going on?! 
PHYLLIS: What is it? 
PHYLLIS: What s it now, dream or no dream? 
PHYLLIS: What should we ask? 
PHYLLIS: What smell? 
PHYLLIS: What the hell do you think you're doing? 
PHYLLIS: What the hell?! 
PHYLLIS: What were you doing in the ladies room?! 
PHYLLIS: What? 
PHYLLIS: What? 
PHYLLIS: What? 
PHYLLIS: What?  
PHYLLIS: What? Is Dan okay? 
PHYLLIS: What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it. 
PHYLLIS: What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital. 
PHYLLIS: What's "Scott's Tots?" 
PHYLLIS: What's going on? 
PHYLLIS: What's going on? 
PHYLLIS: What's gonna make you feel better, big guy? 
PHYLLIS: What's happening to you Michael? 
PHYLLIS: What's he doing? 
PHYLLIS: What's on your suit? 
PHYLLIS: What's the case, Toby? 
PHYLLIS: What's the least we can do to make this okay? 
PHYLLIS: What's wrong with you? 
PHYLLIS: When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian. 
PHYLLIS: When I say it out loud it's so silly.   
PHYLLIS: When I was a little girl... 
PHYLLIS: When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty? 
PHYLLIS: Where are we going this afternoon? 
PHYLLIS: Where are we going? 
PHYLLIS: Where do we get those? 
PHYLLIS: Where's your place? 
PHYLLIS: Whew, well. I guess that s that. 
PHYLLIS: Which one's Glee? 
PHYLLIS: Which thing? 
PHYLLIS: Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He s not terrible. 
PHYLLIS: Who was Pam's first celebrity crush? 
PHYLLIS: Who? 
PHYLLIS: Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley. 
PHYLLIS: Who's that? 
PHYLLIS: Whose hands are these?  Theyre not my hands. I don t know. 
PHYLLIS: Why are you here, Todd? Todd 
PHYLLIS: Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it? 
PHYLLIS: Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California? 
PHYLLIS: Why isn't Dwight turning around? 
PHYLLIS: Why should I have to thank him? 
PHYLLIS: Why were you peering over the stalls?! 
PHYLLIS: Why would you do that? 
PHYLLIS: Why would you do that? 
PHYLLIS: Why wouldn't she? 
PHYLLIS: Why? 
PHYLLIS: Why? 
PHYLLIS: Work. 
PHYLLIS: Wow! Sorry! 
PHYLLIS: Wow, thirteen! 
PHYLLIS: Wow. 
PHYLLIS: Wow. Sounds scary. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah mostly. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah that was a surprise... 
PHYLLIS: Yeah you have this sexy glow. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah! 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, good. Don't do it. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can t just press a magic button. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I don't even have a laptop. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I got stung up my dress. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I like Oscar. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I lost my client. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What? 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I m not ready for this. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I would, too. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, it can t be nothing. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, it's just a picnic. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, pretty stationery. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, real cool. Real power move. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, she said she corrected him five times. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, sign says "Begin tour here." 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, thank you.   
PHYLLIS: Yeah, that s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day? 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, that sounds right. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, the Syracuse branch can t be happy you re taking New York clients. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, there you go.  
PHYLLIS: Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  
PHYLLIS: Yeah, what's the reason? 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, who wrote it? 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah.  Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point.  
PHYLLIS: Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. Poor Angela. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. Yeah. Oh. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour? 
PHYLLIS: Yeah... 
PHYLLIS: Yeah? 
PHYLLIS: Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time. 
PHYLLIS: Yes I do. 
PHYLLIS: Yes you were. 
PHYLLIS: Yes, I got those cute little ones.  Do you think I should have gotten the big ones? 
PHYLLIS: Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before. 
PHYLLIS: Yes, I'm jumping. 
PHYLLIS: Yes, it's marijuana. 
PHYLLIS: Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee.   I guess I was just in the right place at the right time. 
PHYLLIS: Yes, very. 
PHYLLIS: Yes. 
PHYLLIS: Yes. 
PHYLLIS: Yes. 
PHYLLIS: Yes. 
PHYLLIS: Yes. 
PHYLLIS: Yes. Put the DVD in. 
PHYLLIS: You are a pervert! 
PHYLLIS: You can pay me back later for the makeover. 
PHYLLIS: You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this. 
PHYLLIS: You could put your cell phone in it instead. 
PHYLLIS: You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present? 
PHYLLIS: You didn't decorate it? 
PHYLLIS: You don t have to thank us for coming in, it s our job. 
PHYLLIS: You don't even like us as friends? 
PHYLLIS: You don't have to kiss his ass anymore. 
PHYLLIS: You don't have to worry. I'm not going to... 
PHYLLIS: You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality. 
PHYLLIS: You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.   No offense, Jim. I think she's very pretty. 
PHYLLIS: You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday. 
PHYLLIS: You found Uncle Al! 
PHYLLIS: You got dumped? 
PHYLLIS: You guys are together? 
PHYLLIS: You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie. 
PHYLLIS: You have all of our attention just by screaming anything. 
PHYLLIS: You know I know.   You know they know. 
PHYLLIS: You know what? I don t know where the years went.  Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don t even recognize them.

PHYLLIS: You left me in a bad part of town! 
PHYLLIS: You mean the clients you stole from us. 
PHYLLIS: You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. Why aren't you wearing the hairnet? 
PHYLLIS: You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved! 
PHYLLIS: You said fruit, Michael. 
PHYLLIS: You shot Dwight? 
PHYLLIS: You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it. 
PHYLLIS: You should, you should put out salt for the rims  
PHYLLIS: You sound worried. 
PHYLLIS: You tell me. Well, you do mean you and Jim right? Oh God. I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time. I'm sorry! 
PHYLLIS: You think that Andy's family owned slaves?

ROB:   
ROB:  He s still mad. 
ROB:  I m so sorry! I don t know how that could have happened. 
ROB: Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 cc s of George Michael stat. So just... Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number. 
ROB: He said, and I quote,  Hey Rob, nice pipes . That happened! 
ROB: I just-- I just started yappin  about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky. 
ROB: I tell you what, we ll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and I ll do the same, and I m so confident that I ll win, I won t even warm up. 
ROB: Look, it s not my fault that I still live near campus, and it s my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week. 
ROB: My pipes are primo, Champ. Why don t you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes? 
ROB: That's real. 'That ll never change! 
ROB: Will do. I love you, Andy. 
ROBERT:   is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor. 
ROBERT:  About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers. 
ROBERT:  Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade. 
ROBERT:  Delightful. 
ROBERT:  Did you need something from us? 
ROBERT:  Erin. 
ROBERT:  Extraordinary. Did you plan this? 
ROBERT:  ha, Jesus. 
ROBERT:  Heh. 
ROBERT:  Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati. 
ROBERT:  Hey, you found us! 
ROBERT:  I d like to invite the following people to join me for 
ROBERT:  I ll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual. 
ROBERT:  I m afraid you ve lost my interest. 
ROBERT:  I stepped in right away and start-- 
ROBERT:  I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response. Finger Lakes 
ROBERT:  I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest  I am gay. 
ROBERT:  In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.  There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator? 
ROBERT:  I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman. 
ROBERT:  Kevin! 
ROBERT:  Nellie, really, nine fifty? 
ROBERT:  Oh, still here. Terrific. 
ROBERT:  Oh, you d go someplace else. That s not it, that s not the answer. 
ROBERT:  Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night. 
ROBERT:  Say hello grandma. 
ROBERT:  That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere. 
ROBERT:  This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out. 
ROBERT:  This is atrocious. 
ROBERT:  This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better?  
ROBERT:  What am I up to? 
ROBERT:  Why is Jim treating the magician poorly? 
ROBERT:  Yes, for god s sake Andy. Yes, come in. 
ROBERT:  Yes. You do.  
ROBERT:  You seem unimpressed. Ghosts don t scare you? 
ROBERT: "Good morning, Robert," says no one because our receptionist is in Florida.  Pam! 
ROBERT: A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day. 
ROBERT: A game or a match? 
ROBERT: Absolutely. 
ROBERT: Absolutely. 
ROBERT: Ah  
ROBERT: Ah, please. Here s what it is. It s a doodle. 
ROBERT: Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don t even know my real name. I m the *bleep* lizard king.  
ROBERT: Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it? 
ROBERT: Ah. 
ROBERT: Ah. 
ROBERT: Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's 
ROBERT: All life is sex. And all sex is competition. 
ROBERT: All right. Thanks. 
ROBERT: Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. "Oh, wait," she thought, "I don't have a husband." For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, "Baby, are you okay?" Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, "I'm fine, b!tch, I'm fine." 
ROBERT: Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this.  
ROBERT: Amongst them was a man, tall, slim. 
ROBERT: And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness. 
ROBERT: and the hero, who's that based on? 
ROBERT: And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it? 
ROBERT: And what? 
ROBERT: And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It s a waste of your time. That s how every day s begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man. 
ROBERT: And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared? 
ROBERT: And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans. 
ROBERT: Andrew sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all. 
ROBERT: Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight? 
ROBERT: Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say? 
ROBERT: Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this. 
ROBERT: Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is "impotence." 
ROBERT: Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida? 
ROBERT: Andrew.  
ROBERT: Andy why don't we discuss this at a-- 
ROBERT: Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she ll shine. 
ROBERT: Andy you should leave. Now. 
ROBERT: Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this. 
ROBERT: Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set? 
ROBERT: Andy, do you know why I chose you? 
ROBERT: Andy, Erin, you can join us now. 
ROBERT: Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work? 
ROBERT: Andy, just answer the question. 
ROBERT: Andy, that's very kind-- 
ROBERT: Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny.  
ROBERT: Andy, where shall I put your basil plant? 
ROBERT: Andy, why don't you just take a seat? 
ROBERT: Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share?  
ROBERT: Andy. Let s see if there s a good fit first. Then we ll talk. 
ROBERT: Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said. 
ROBERT: Are we done? 
ROBERT: Are you scared of snakes? 
ROBERT: Are you sure? 
ROBERT: Are you telling me that there s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands? 
ROBERT: Because it's too terrifying to imagine. Now we're cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours? 
ROBERT: Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will 
ROBERT: Big Mac idea. That sounds encouraging. 
ROBERT: Can everyone just, please  I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and   how should I say this   Columbian whites. What   what is this about, uh, Binghamton? 
ROBERT: Can I have it? 
ROBERT: Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this. 
ROBERT: Cheers. 
ROBERT: Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now. 
ROBERT: Cookies. Cookie placement. 
ROBERT: Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding. 
ROBERT: David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women. 
ROBERT: Describe your day so far. 
ROBERT: Do I look like someone who would waste my own time? 
ROBERT: Don t worry. I ve scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on. 
ROBERT: Double. 
ROBERT: Double.  
ROBERT: Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102. 
ROBERT: Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place. 
ROBERT: Dwight. 
ROBERT: Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO. 
ROBERT: Elmo, god s sake, it s the Elmo era. 
ROBERT: End the mistakes. That is all I ask.  And you can't have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all. 
ROBERT: Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning. 
ROBERT: Erin, what can I get for you? 
ROBERT: Everyone, conference room, now.  
ROBERT: Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is... a paper company.  
ROBERT: Everyone. I d like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone. 
ROBERT: Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen.  Why'd they add coconut? I miss original. 
ROBERT: Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery. 
ROBERT: Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning? 
ROBERT: Excuse me? 
ROBERT: Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us. How dare we let it into our decision making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships. It's funny, isn't it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear. 
ROBERT: Fine. 
ROBERT: Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here. 
ROBERT: Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard. 
ROBERT: Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party.  
ROBERT: Good. 
ROBERT: Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I ll just duck out and run the company for a while. 
ROBERT: Great. Thank you. 
ROBERT: Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge. 
ROBERT: Ha, I guess I think they re losers. 
ROBERT: Harry  
ROBERT: Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems  so poorly timed. 
ROBERT: He just hung up on me mid-sentence. 
ROBERT: Hello Andy. 
ROBERT: Hello Jim.  
ROBERT: Hello, Andy. Excellent tie. 
ROBERT: Hello. 
ROBERT: Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio. 
ROBERT: Here, use this one.   
ROBERT: Hey!  Oh! 
ROBERT: Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess. 
ROBERT: Hi. 
ROBERT: Hmm. 
ROBERT: Hold one finger up to Susan. You ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say,  are you taking your medicine?  
ROBERT: How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far? 
ROBERT: How do you mean? 
ROBERT: I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla. 
ROBERT: I almost didn't come in today.  
ROBERT: I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested. 
ROBERT: I am not. 
ROBERT: I am not. Huh. 
ROBERT: I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we? 
ROBERT: I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do. 
ROBERT: I can expense it. Darryl & 
ROBERT: I d love some coffee. 
ROBERT: I did not know about the sales figures. 
ROBERT: I don t- I don t wanna say- 
ROBERT: I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately. 
ROBERT: I don't know. Maybe not. Just come. 
ROBERT: I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason. 
ROBERT: I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears. 
ROBERT: I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said   
ROBERT: I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking.  
ROBERT: I just did. 
ROBERT: I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you. 
ROBERT: I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing.  
ROBERT: I m never uncomfortable. 
ROBERT: I m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don t use ballpoint pens. 
ROBERT: I m not kidding. 
ROBERT: I miss being in a band. 
ROBERT: I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way. 
ROBERT: I never said that. 
ROBERT: I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn t until my marriage to Angela that I realized how charmless I find the female body. 
ROBERT: I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan. 
ROBERT: I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car. 
ROBERT: I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street.  
ROBERT: I should go. 
ROBERT: I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better. 
ROBERT: I would be eternally grateful. It s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one. 
ROBERT: I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place. 
ROBERT: If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?  
ROBERT: I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy. 
ROBERT: I'll see you next week Will.  
ROBERT: I'm just about to give the tour. 
ROBERT: I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work. 
ROBERT: I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me.  
ROBERT: I'm selling the house, actually. 
ROBERT: I'm sorry? 
ROBERT: Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination.  Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly. 
ROBERT: In the box. 
ROBERT: Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants? 
ROBERT: Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party. 
ROBERT: Is this a video conference you're having with "Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz"? 
ROBERT: It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting? 
ROBERT: It s a wrong answer. 
ROBERT: It s true. They ve been preserved for thousands of years. They re all over. 
ROBERT: It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating. 
ROBERT: It's a basil plant. 
ROBERT: It's a command. 
ROBERT: It's been a great year. 
ROBERT: It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse. 
ROBERT: It's done. 
ROBERT: It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room.  Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim? 
ROBERT: It's nice. I know. 
ROBERT: It's the standard one. The one everyone has. 
ROBERT: I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice....I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better. 
ROBERT: Jim what are you What a surprise. 
ROBERT: Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it. 
ROBERT: Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss. 
ROBERT: Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times. 
ROBERT: Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor? 
ROBERT: Jim, you alright? What are you doing? 
ROBERT: Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street? 
ROBERT: Jiminey Christmas indeed. 
ROBERT: Join us. You must see what you were laughing about. 
ROBERT: Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright? 
ROBERT: Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here? 
ROBERT: Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is. 
ROBERT: Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she s here today to see if there s a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager. 
ROBERT: Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free. 
ROBERT: Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown? 
ROBERT: Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don t know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You ll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them  you are welcome.   Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it. 
ROBERT: Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I ll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you re a winner. If I didn t, I don t. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong. 
ROBERT: Let s do it now. What s number one? 
ROBERT: Let's get Jim in here.  Where's Jim? 
ROBERT: Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place. 
ROBERT: Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar. 
ROBERT: Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis. 
ROBERT: Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe.  
ROBERT: Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job. 
ROBERT: Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed? 
ROBERT: Midnight Rambler? 
ROBERT: Might as well have been sketching a cube. 
ROBERT: Mmm. Wow. 
ROBERT: My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you. 
ROBERT: My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is? 
ROBERT: My serve! 
ROBERT: Nah, it's good. 
ROBERT: Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office- 
ROBERT: Nellie. 
ROBERT: Nellie? 
ROBERT: No  my god. 
ROBERT: No games. 
ROBERT: No games. 
ROBERT: No, come on. 
ROBERT: No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight.  
ROBERT: No, I'm certain you said basil. 
ROBERT: No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist- 
ROBERT: no, Nellie, she- 
ROBERT: No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life. 
ROBERT: No, no. 
ROBERT: No, that's absolutely the case. 
ROBERT: No. 
ROBERT: No. 
ROBERT: No. 
ROBERT: No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think. 
ROBERT: Not much we can do about this until he gets here. 
ROBERT: Now then, how are we today? 
ROBERT: Now we get to the bottom of Nellie s  yes, yes, yes, yes, never.  
ROBERT: Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots! 
ROBERT: Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we? 
ROBERT: Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me? 
ROBERT: Oh my. It was just actually cookies the whole time? 
ROBERT: Oh yes it can. 
ROBERT: Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it. 
ROBERT: Oh! Thank you. Uh . 
ROBERT: Oh, for god   
ROBERT: Oh, hi there. 
ROBERT: Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son? 
ROBERT: Oh, no, you- 
ROBERT: Oh. 
ROBERT: Oh. 
ROBERT: Ohh, unfortunately, yes. 
ROBERT: Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest. 
ROBERT: Okay. My serve. 
ROBERT: Oo! 
ROBERT: Oo, a little ice on that maybe. 
ROBERT: Oof.  Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now.  I'm actually the CEO. 
ROBERT: Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom. 
ROBERT: Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time  
ROBERT: Oscar. A pleasure. 
ROBERT: Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God! 
ROBERT: Pam, Pam, you ve completely bungled this! 
ROBERT: Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this. 
ROBERT: Pam, when s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn t hold the memories in? 
ROBERT: People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being- 
ROBERT: -pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as "normal." It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated. 
ROBERT: Please.  
ROBERT: Probably shouldn t have said that.  
ROBERT: Right. I mean you re an accountant. Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane. 
ROBERT: Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn t you agree. 
ROBERT: Sesame street. 
ROBERT: Shalom.  Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours.  I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month.  
ROBERT: Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there?  They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one. 
ROBERT: She likes you. 
ROBERT: She, she is remarkable. 
ROBERT: Shh  shh   
ROBERT: Shopaholic. 
ROBERT: Simply end the mistakes 
ROBERT: Sit down, Dwight. 
ROBERT: Skinned knee. 
ROBERT: So I think you know what we want to know. 
ROBERT: So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith!  Excited! 
ROBERT: So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure? 
ROBERT: Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don t you think? Well, I doodle too, but I m not an artist. So I draw words and lists. 
ROBERT: Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim. 
ROBERT: Sounded like mine. 
ROBERT: Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it s birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why? 
ROBERT: Take it easy. Nice and easy. 
ROBERT: Tambourine? You know I m the CEO, right? 
ROBERT: Tell my wife you're lying. 
ROBERT: Thank you so much. 
ROBERT: Thank you. 
ROBERT: Thank you. 
ROBERT: Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason! 
ROBERT: That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry. 
ROBERT: That is very cold. 
ROBERT: That sounds good. 
ROBERT: That was bad. 
ROBERT: That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim? 
ROBERT: That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic.  
ROBERT: The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies. 
ROBERT: The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too. 
ROBERT: The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts. 
ROBERT: The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community. 
ROBERT: The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with. 
ROBERT: The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes!  
ROBERT: The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error prone office. 
ROBERT: There s someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez. 
ROBERT: There s something about an underdog that really inspires the unexceptional. 
ROBERT: There we go. 
ROBERT: They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they? 
ROBERT: This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent. 
ROBERT: This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with? 
ROBERT: This is preposterous. 
ROBERT: This room I liked for the view. I dreamed that I would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before.  
ROBERT: To the kitchen. Onward! 
ROBERT: Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn t you agree Andy? 
ROBERT: Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's? 
ROBERT: Vanilla? No no no no. You ll never guess in a million billion years you ll never guess. 
ROBERT: We have a manager. 
ROBERT: We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman? 
ROBERT: Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician- 
ROBERT: We'll talk.  
ROBERT: Well that's a shame. 
ROBERT: Well what is the idea? 
ROBERT: Well you can't say no. 
ROBERT: Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here... is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office. 
ROBERT: Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag. 
ROBERT: Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us. 
ROBERT: Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade. 
ROBERT: Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright.  
ROBERT: Well... 
ROBERT: What are we talking about? 
ROBERT: What are your thoughts. 
ROBERT: What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard? 
ROBERT: What is this? 
ROBERT: What should we play? 
ROBERT: What, as some sort of last hoorah? 
ROBERT: What's the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person. 
ROBERT: When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn't that be nice? 
ROBERT: When I put in the screening room, I bought three 
ROBERT: When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound.  She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter. 
ROBERT: When two animals are having sex, one of them... 
ROBERT: Where did this come from? Did Andy say that? 
ROBERT: Where is everyone? Where is Andy? 
ROBERT: Where s the Advil, Jim? I think I ve hit my limit on the Tylenol   Oh. 
ROBERT: Who are they? 
ROBERT: Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers?  There you go. Consensus. 
ROBERT: Who is it? 
ROBERT: Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa.  
ROBERT: Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh? 
ROBERT: Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it.  
ROBERT: Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he s all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him. 
ROBERT: Why didn t you simply ask Andy to clarify? Asking is a very easy thing to do. You re obviously very close. . Oh I see. This no longer seems like my business . 
ROBERT: Why would I ..? 
ROBERT: Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me. 
ROBERT: Wine collection. 
ROBERT: --with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing  Chief of Staff Wesley Silver. 
ROBERT: Wonderful. 
ROBERT: Yeah, hello? 
ROBERT: Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun. 
ROBERT: Yeah. 
ROBERT: Yeah. 
ROBERT: Yeah. 
ROBERT: Yeah. 
ROBERT: Yep. 
ROBERT: Yes,  course. Why don t you list the things that would keep you from helping me. 
ROBERT: Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer. 
ROBERT: Yes, hello, nice to meet you. 
ROBERT: Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going. 
ROBERT: Yes. 
ROBERT: Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby? 
ROBERT: You alright? 
ROBERT: You can just put it down. 
ROBERT: You don't want to hear the other one. You love marmalade. 
ROBERT: You feeling fulfilled in your life? 
ROBERT: You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have. 
ROBERT: You guys mind if they join us? 
ROBERT: You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try 
ROBERT: You like her. 
ROBERT: You lying son of a bitch! 
ROBERT: You made it. 
ROBERT: You people say I led you, but it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us. I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers. 
ROBERT: You re blackmailing me. 
ROBERT: You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it. 
ROBERT: You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby. 
ROBERT: You should see the whole thing. 
ROBERT: You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day? 
ROBERT: You were dining alone? All those people are you? 
ROBERT: You were going to talk at the end of the  I m not here. 
ROBERT: Your heart is broken. So is mine. 
ROBERT: You're a band. 
ROBERT: You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves. 
ROBERT: You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in. 
RODGERS: Can he do this? 
RODGERS: Flag on the play. 
RODGERS: Look, man, you re not terrible. We ve heard a lot of really good singers today and you re just not good enough. 
RODGERS: No, you re a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on. 
ROGER: No. I heard you. 
ROLANDO:   Uh, your late, everyone's already in the conference room. Karen will be right here to take you over. 
ROLANDO:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Rolando. Oh yes, she's been expecting your call.  
ROLANDO: Hi. 
ROLANDO: Karen? He's on line one. 
ROLF: Go to hell. 
ROLF: I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don t do earbuds. 
ROLF: I m Rolf. Rolf Ahl. 
ROLF: I think I ve heard everything I need to hear. 
ROLF: Nice. 
ROLF: No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don t open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe. 
ROLF: No. You re interviewing for it. I m getting it. 
ROLF: Thank you, Dwight. I ll be in touch. 
ROLF: Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you re qualified to evaluate me? 
ROLF: What are your credentials? 
ROLF: Yeah, it s that weird hour where it s too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swanson s. 
ROLF: Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right? 
ROLPH: Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF. 
ROLPH: Here's an accounting question for 
ROLPH: I don't hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friend's heart. Let's go! 
ROLPH: Is there a... Meredith here? 
ROLPH: It's true! 
ROLPH: No way! You don't mean that! 
ROLPH: What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions- 
ROLPH: Woah. Homemade? 
ROLPH: You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces! 
ROMANKO: I m sorry. Do I still need to be here? 
ROMANKO: I wouldn t say a rage. 
ROMANKO: Thank you. Thank you. 
RONNIE: Does anyone want to dance? 
RONNIE: Dunder Mifflin, this is Ronnie. 
RONNIE: Hi, can I help you? 
RORY: Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves. 
RORY: I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him. 
ROSE: All right, well, lets get back to it. 'Cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute . 
ROSE: I have no idea. 
ROSE: No, it's--Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
ROSE: No, that's not part of it. 
ROSE: Okay! 
ROSE: Okay! 
ROSE: Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of 'Staying Alive' by the Bee Gees. Do you know that song? 
ROSE: Yeah, okay. You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him. 
ROY:   Congrats, man. 
ROY:  Ah, w-we'll see you next year. 
ROY:  Ahh God! 
ROY:  An alliance? What the hell is he talking about? 
ROY:  Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's. 
ROY:  Darryl! Ha-ha! What s happening? 
ROY:  Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball. 
ROY:  Hey man, uh... I'm sorry.   Thanks.  Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something? 
ROY:  Hey, want to get out of here? 
ROY:  Hey. 
ROY:  Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later.  
ROY:  I think he's dancing. 
ROY:  Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend. 
ROY:  Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam. 
ROY:  Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done. 
ROY:  Not here. Not here. It's either here or here.  Not here. . 
ROY:  Pam! Pam! I love this guy!  Come on! 
ROY:  There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the "grief counseling" session. 
ROY:  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah. 
ROY:  What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert? 
ROY:  Yes. 
ROY:  You're joking right? 
ROY: ...talking about? He's a jackass every year. 
ROY: Absolutely. 
ROY: After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest. I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted. I gotta win her back. 
ROY: Ah, thank you! 
ROY: All right, I'll see ya. Pam's 
ROY: All right, let's go. Warehouse 
ROY: All right. 
ROY: Are they going to call the cops? 
ROY: Are you kidding? 
ROY: Are you mad at me now? 
ROY: Are you still mad at me now? 
ROY: Are you still mad at me? 
ROY: At the party? Warehouse 
ROY: Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice. 
ROY: Boys R Us! Warehouse 
ROY: But you're not even gonna try to go out with him?  I don't get you Pam. 
ROY: Chicken or fish? 
ROY: Come on  
ROY: Come on! 
ROY: Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league. 
ROY: Come on, you mad at me? 
ROY: Come on. 
ROY: Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one.  Just kidding. 
ROY: Crazy day, huh? 
ROY: Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car. 
ROY: Don't yell?! 
ROY: Engaged, yeah. 
ROY: Exactly. 
ROY: Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car. 
ROY: Good, glad. OK. 
ROY: Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh? 
ROY: Halpert? 
ROY: Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam! 
ROY: He's in the office. 
ROY: Hey babe. 
ROY: Hey baby. 
ROY: Hey Darryl, what's happenin'? 
ROY: Hey Halpert! 
ROY: Hey! Guys, what's going on? 
ROY: Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you. 
ROY: Hey, baby. 
ROY: Hey, hey, hey. 
ROY: Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock. 
ROY: Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh? 
ROY: Hey, man. 
ROY: Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico? 
ROY: Hey, they're playing our song. 
ROY: Hey, what's up, guys? How you been? 
ROY: Hey. 
ROY: Hey. 
ROY: How are ya? Pam's 
ROY: How are you likin' the new car? 
ROY: How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh? 
ROY: Huh. 
ROY: Huh? huh? Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding. 
ROY: I can read you like a book. 
ROY: I can't for your art show tonight. 
ROY: I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered. 
ROY: I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all. 
ROY: I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something. 
ROY: I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going? 
ROY: I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, "You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)"? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words. 
ROY: I don't understand. 
ROY: I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like "When are we going to go on a date-date?" 
ROY: I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste. 
ROY: I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom. 
ROY: I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance? 
ROY: I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10! 
ROY: I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man. 
ROY: I thought you were a friend. 
ROY: I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning. 
ROY: I was definitely right.  Oh, brother. 
ROY: I was just kidding. You know I didn't mean it. I can't... 
ROY: If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right? 
ROY: I-I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
ROY: I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert. 
ROY: I'm good. 
ROY: I'm not gonna hit you or anything. 
ROY: I'm not really into strippers. You know what I find sexy? Pam's art. She's an artist and I appreciate that. It's very moving and sexy. The art. 
ROY: I'm so sorry, Pammy. I really wasn't gonna do anything. But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and... I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong. 
ROY: In my truck. 
ROY: It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going. 
ROY: It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them. 
ROY: It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man. 
ROY: I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on!  Darryl! Darryl! 
ROY: Jet ski money? 
ROY: Jim came on to you? 
ROY: Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam. 
ROY: Just tell her I'll talk to her later. 
ROY: Like next to no benefits. 
ROY: Little package! 
ROY: Love ya. 
ROY: Natural redhead. 
ROY: Never. 
ROY: No! 
ROY: No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening! 
ROY: No, it was Captain Jack. 
ROY: No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right? 
ROY: No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday. 
ROY: No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home. 
ROY: No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything! 
ROY: No, you take it easy. 
ROY: No. 
ROY: Nope. 
ROY: Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy. 
ROY: Oh, cool. 
ROY: Oh, no. That is not worth it. 
ROY: OK. 
ROY: Ok. 
ROY: OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows? 
ROY: OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper? 
ROY: Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies? Pam's 
ROY: Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something. 
ROY: Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right? 
ROY: On this side. 
ROY: One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here. 
ROY: Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy. 
ROY: Pam. Go. 
ROY: Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you? 
ROY: Please. I just got some stuff I gotta say to you.  
ROY: Really? 
ROY: See you. 
ROY: She took you down, huh? 
ROY: So I only use three? 
ROY: So Pam's happy? 
ROY: So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad. 
ROY: So you gonna start datin' Halpert then? 
ROY: So you havin' a good day? 
ROY: So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you.  
ROY: So, we're cool, right? 
ROY: So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame. 
ROY: Sorry about that. 
ROY: Sorry, babe. I am just beat. 
ROY: Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off? 
ROY: Sweet. 
ROY: Sweet. All right. 
ROY: Thanks...aw. 
ROY: That corporate booty, he likes to hit it! 
ROY: That's awesome. That's what I want. 
ROY: That's disgusting. 
ROY: That's her? 
ROY: That's what I'm talking about. 
ROY: That's what I'm talking about. 
ROY: The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes. 
ROY: This is awesome. 
ROY: To my place? 
ROY: Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond? 
ROY: We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe. 
ROY: Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life. 
ROY: What are you gay? 
ROY: What does that mean? 
ROY: What the hell man? 
ROY: What, you're mad at me? 
ROY: What? 
ROY: What? 
ROY: Whatever. I'm in charge of the music. 
ROY: What's going on with Pam? 
ROY: What's up? 
ROY: What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit? 
ROY: What's wrong? 
ROY: When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die? Captain 
ROY: Where did you go to school? 
ROY: Which one is she?  
ROY: Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on! 
ROY: Why don't you get on that? 
ROY: Why? 
ROY: Wow. 
ROY: Yeah! That's great. 
ROY: Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money. 
ROY: Yeah, let's get out of here. 
ROY: Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.

RYAN:   Yeah. 
RYAN:   You did that for me? 
RYAN:   You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man.

RYAN:  Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve.  
RYAN:  Hey Uncle Lucas, it s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it s different because it s your wife? Well, that doesn t make any sense to me. 
RYAN:  Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...

RYAN:  I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this. 
RYAN:  I hooked up with her on February 13th. 
RYAN:  I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense. 
RYAN:  I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint. 
RYAN:  I think it's self-explanatory.  Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?

RYAN:  Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts. 
RYAN:  Thanks Erin. 
RYAN:  Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened. 
RYAN:  That is so badass. So hardcore. 
RYAN:  Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet. 
RYAN:  Um, I was at another dumpster! 
RYAN:  What? 
RYAN:  What? 
RYAN:  When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time.  Robotic

RYAN:  Whose butt is that? 
RYAN:  Will do.  Won't do. 
RYAN:  Wuphf.com! 
RYAN:  Yeah.  
RYAN:  Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing. 
RYAN:  You scared me. 
RYAN:  You're the best. Thank you. 
RYAN: "What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!" WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky! 
RYAN: "Yo, Ry from WUPHF!" 
RYAN: ... Later guys. 
RYAN: ... Yeah. 
RYAN: ...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off... 
RYAN: ...I don't. 
RYAN: ...It doesn't apply. 
RYAN: ...It wasn't personal. 
RYAN: ...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan. 
RYAN: A dime and a nickel. 
RYAN: A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over. 
RYAN: A waffle?

RYAN: Ah, well, I'm interested in business. 
RYAN: Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act. 
RYAN: Ahh, I don't think so, no...

RYAN: All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website. 
RYAN: All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?

RYAN: Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear. Pizza 
RYAN: America is one big mall. 
RYAN: An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters. 
RYAN: And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --

RYAN: -and you jump in front of them. 
RYAN: And you know that I m capable of this. 
RYAN: And? 
RYAN: Andy. 
RYAN: Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive. 
RYAN: Any other questions?  Kelly Kapoor. 
RYAN: Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year. 
RYAN: Are we staying til five? 
RYAN: Are you happy you did? 
RYAN: Are you holding this chair? 
RYAN: Are you scared?

RYAN: Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you. 
RYAN: Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...

RYAN: But I'm good at managing people who do sales . 
RYAN: But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed... whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do... 
RYAN: But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city. 
RYAN: But the other one is. I've heard that before. 
RYAN: But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch? 
RYAN: But... 
RYAN: Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.

RYAN: Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look? 
RYAN: Cool.

RYAN: Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom. 
RYAN: Creed did you organize the menu book? 
RYAN: Darryl Rogers? 
RYAN: David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right? 
RYAN: Deal.  
RYAN: Definitely. 
RYAN: Depression? 
RYAN: Did she say something? 
RYAN: Did this happen on company property? 
RYAN: Did you ask me here for any specific reason?

RYAN: Do you mean Neverland? 
RYAN: Do you really know which one is correct? 
RYAN: Do you want this?  
RYAN: Do you want to go out to dinner tonight? 
RYAN: Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.  Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back. 
RYAN: Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael? 
RYAN: Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she... 
RYAN: Don t talk to me right now. I m sorry. I- I know you re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don t understand is...  
RYAN: Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that! 
RYAN: Don't interrupt. 
RYAN: Don't just criticize my idea! 
RYAN: Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that. 
RYAN: Don't vaccinate it. 
RYAN: Don't worry about that. Just re-log it.  
RYAN: Don't you mean constructive criticism? 
RYAN: Don't you see why that's insane? 
RYAN: Dude, I think you have appendicitis.

RYAN: Dwight, why is it on us to protect you? 
RYAN: Dwight. 
RYAN: Dwight? 
RYAN: Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.

RYAN: Exactly. 
RYAN: Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years.

RYAN: Good for you, man. Good for you. 
RYAN: Good luck Michael.

RYAN: Got that.  Get down. 
RYAN: Gotcha. 
RYAN: Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company. 
RYAN: Great. 
RYAN: Great. She's cute, huh? 
RYAN: Guys, guys, guys, please.  Ok, all right, it's all yours now. 
RYAN: Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy. 
RYAN: Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK? 
RYAN: Guys, one second.  
RYAN: Ha ha, plus size models, maybe. 
RYAN: Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word. 
RYAN: Has to be done. We'll press send together.

RYAN: He hasn't even said a word yet. Just giggling. 
RYAN: He ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He s allergic but he ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you. 
RYAN: He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted. 
RYAN: He takes what he wants. 
RYAN: Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding? 
RYAN: Hell yeah. I'll hook it up.  
RYAN: Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out. 
RYAN: Hello, what do we have here? 
RYAN: Hello. 
RYAN: Hello?

RYAN: Hello? 
RYAN: Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer.   That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there. 
RYAN: Here you go. 
RYAN: Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton. 
RYAN: He's bluffing, Pam. 
RYAN: He's rubbing his neck. 
RYAN: He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck! 
RYAN: Hey   asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single? 
RYAN: Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship. 
RYAN: Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'? 
RYAN: Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure. 
RYAN: Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair. 
RYAN: Hey Kevin...   That's really funny. 
RYAN: Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world? 
RYAN: Hey Michael. 
RYAN: Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo? 
RYAN: Hey! Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck! Okay? We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all. 
RYAN: Hey, buddy. Welcome back. 
RYAN: Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after? 
RYAN: Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave. 
RYAN: Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember. 
RYAN: Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly. 
RYAN: Hey, I'm WUPHF. 
RYAN: Hey, is Katy coming? 
RYAN: Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys. 
RYAN: Hey, Pam? I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation. 
RYAN: Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there. 
RYAN: Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult. 
RYAN: Hey, this is fun. 
RYAN: Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh? 
RYAN: Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender? 
RYAN: Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive? 
RYAN: Hey, you. 
RYAN: Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine.  Oh, not cool! 
RYAN: Hey. 
RYAN: Hey. 
RYAN: Hey. 
RYAN: Hey. 
RYAN: Hey. 
RYAN: Hey. 
RYAN: Hey. 
RYAN: Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong? 
RYAN: Hey. You're looking for me? 
RYAN: Hi. 
RYAN: Hold on one second.  Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in? 
RYAN: Hold on, I'll get them on the phone. 
RYAN: Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses. 
RYAN: How about rainbows? 
RYAN: How could you do this to me, Michael? You just cost me $60,000. 
RYAN: How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective. 
RYAN: How do you live with a franchise this bad? 
RYAN: How is it insulting to say that you're good at something? 
RYAN: How long do you think it s been up there, Kevin? 
RYAN: How long until you actually get this presentation ready? 
RYAN: How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want. 
RYAN: How much memory does it have without the booster? 
RYAN: How's everybody doing?! 
RYAN: How's It Going? 
RYAN: How's it going? Good day? 
RYAN: Huh, is it ok if I call her? 
RYAN: Huh? 
RYAN: Huh? 
RYAN: Huh?  
RYAN: I- 
RYAN: I am not giving you my keys. 
RYAN: I am not interested in anything I have to make myself! 
RYAN: I am so sorry. 
RYAN: I am very flattered. I was his second choice after "Pass." 
RYAN: I am. 
RYAN: I am. 
RYAN: I can eat. 
RYAN: I can field this one. 
RYAN: I can get there. 
RYAN: I can get you a tutor if you need-  
RYAN: I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that. 
RYAN: I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK? 
RYAN: I can't believe I started the fire. Dwight and 
RYAN: I can't- I can't not touch it. 
RYAN: I can't imagine what I would have done. 
RYAN: I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends. 
RYAN: I can't wait to meet him. 
RYAN: I did not see Rango. 
RYAN: I did. 
RYAN: I did. 
RYAN: I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now. 
RYAN: I don't do that stuff anymore. 
RYAN: I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong. 
RYAN: I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour. 
RYAN: I don't know what you're talking about. 
RYAN: I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore. 
RYAN: I don't know, maybe. 
RYAN: I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking. 
RYAN: I don't know. Depends if you like a little junk in ...  Umm... She's really cool. 
RYAN: I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean. 
RYAN: I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost.   Can I tell you what else I learned? 
RYAN: I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any. 
RYAN: I don't think you know what you're saying. 
RYAN: I don't think you understand how jeopardy works. 
RYAN: I don't wanna go back in. 
RYAN: I don't want ketchup. 
RYAN: I don't want to be like "a guy" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the "crossword puzzle guy". And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the "something guy". 
RYAN: I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space. 
RYAN: I felt terrorized. 
RYAN: I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid? 
RYAN: I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway. 
RYAN: I finally mastered commitment. 
RYAN: I forget it, brutha. 
RYAN: I found a copy of it in the copier tray. 
RYAN: I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale! 
RYAN: I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you. 
RYAN: I get that. 
RYAN: I go to a lot of parties. 
RYAN: I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led. 
RYAN: I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing. 
RYAN: I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. 
RYAN: I gotta work on this. 
RYAN: I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine. 
RYAN: I guess I forgot.  
RYAN: I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint. 
RYAN: I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that? 
RYAN: I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money. 
RYAN: I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited. 
RYAN: I have the emergency contacts. 
RYAN: I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O. 
RYAN: I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know. 
RYAN: I help you with your things and you help me with my things. 
RYAN: I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly. 
RYAN: I--- I would find a way. 
RYAN: I insist you take your work calls. 
RYAN: I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk. 
RYAN: I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not... 
RYAN: I just got in. I applied, I go at night. 
RYAN: I just... I just wanted to have dinner. 
RYAN: I know it's you guys. 
RYAN: I know what I said. 
RYAN: I know where we're not. 
RYAN: I know, but you wanted the big thing. 
RYAN: I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day. 
RYAN: I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff. 
RYAN: I like it, I like it!  
RYAN: I love it. 
RYAN: I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack. 
RYAN: I love you. 
RYAN: I m not wearing the right shoes for this. 
RYAN: I m sorry,  L ? 
RYAN: I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema. 
RYAN: I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to. 
RYAN: I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship. 
RYAN: I never went to Thailand. 
RYAN: I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh... 
RYAN: I really did not do anything. 
RYAN: I stretched before I came. 
RYAN: I think about that all the time. 
RYAN: I think I heard it on Roy's side. 
RYAN: I think you should get it. You really grew into it. 
RYAN: I think. 
RYAN: I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so... 
RYAN: I told you not to call about small problems. 
RYAN: I ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It s a big university town. And, uh, that s not garbage, it s out clothes. 
RYAN: I want an outsider. 
RYAN: I want the same thing you want. I want to take Jim Halpert down. I want in. 
RYAN: I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years. I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff. I think I never fully processed 9/11. Um, I want you to know I've changed. 
RYAN: I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess. 
RYAN: I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second? 
RYAN: I went to Fort Lauderdale. 
RYAN: I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight. 
RYAN: I won't look at it. 
RYAN: I would love to. 
RYAN: I would love to.  Why not? 
RYAN: I would rather have $60,000, honestly. 
RYAN: I... wouldn't even know where to start. 
RYAN: I'd die for you too. 
RYAN: I'd like to make a toast to the troops. All the troops. Both sides. 
RYAN: I'd like to see him try.   
RYAN: I'd love to talk to you about it more. 
RYAN: I'd rather not say. 
RYAN: I'd rather not say. 
RYAN: If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget too. 
RYAN: If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time. 
RYAN: If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid not to do it, right? 
RYAN: If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael? That would go a long way coming from you. 
RYAN: I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs. 
RYAN: I'll go. 
RYAN: I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please. 
RYAN: I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight? 
RYAN: I'll use it when you're done. 
RYAN: I'm already in business school. 
RYAN: I'm betting on myself. 
RYAN: I'm doing something over here. 
RYAN: I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen. Do you? 
RYAN: I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second. 
RYAN: I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers. 
RYAN: I'm going to put everything in terms of "real dollars". 
RYAN: I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky. 
RYAN: I'm gonna make a spreadsheet. 
RYAN: I'm good! How are you? So... 
RYAN: I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions. 
RYAN: I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change. 
RYAN: I'm installing File Share on all the computers. 
RYAN: I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts. 
RYAN: I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. Kevin just made the list. 
RYAN: I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night.  
RYAN: I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not saying one is better than the other. 
RYAN: I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars. 
RYAN: I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming. 
RYAN: I'm on it Jim. I'm on it. 
RYAN: I'm on Michael. 
RYAN: I'm really sorry, Dwight. 
RYAN: I'm really sorry, Dwight. 
RYAN: I'm really uncomfortable. 
RYAN: I'm so psyched you're here! 
RYAN: I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better? 
RYAN: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... 
RYAN: I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting. 
RYAN: I'm swamped, Michael.   Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27. 
RYAN: I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky. 
RYAN: I'm trying but you need to- 
RYAN: I'm your boss. 
RYAN: In you go. 
RYAN: Instead of $5,000 a year from now? 
RYAN: Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer? 
RYAN: Is Jim coming back. 
RYAN: Is that your Cousin Mose? 
RYAN: Is there a curtain rod in the room? 
RYAN: Is there a prize? 
RYAN: Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here. 
RYAN: Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint? 
RYAN: Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on? 
RYAN: Is your wife still your contact? 
RYAN: It did, all ready. 
RYAN: It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer. 
RYAN: It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail.  A thousand business cards with this address and phone number. 
RYAN: It s really, really good Robert. Let me explain. 
RYAN: It says 
RYAN: It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question 
RYAN: It was indescribable. 
RYAN: It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole. 
RYAN: It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base. 
RYAN: It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation. 
RYAN: It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him. 
RYAN: It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store. 
RYAN: It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months. Deleted Scene 3 
RYAN: It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race? 
RYAN: It's gotta be because they all want their clients. 
RYAN: It's great to see you Kev. 
RYAN: It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold. 
RYAN: It's inevitable, right? 
RYAN: It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street. 
RYAN: It's my - 
RYAN: It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need. 
RYAN: It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works. 
RYAN: It's not fair to you. And it's really not fair to me. 
RYAN: It's not irrelevant. Details 
RYAN: It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant. 
RYAN: It's not that kind of trip. I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school. And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go. And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you? 
RYAN: It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited. 
RYAN: It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that. 
RYAN: I've always found beauty in uncommon places. Homeless people. Graffiti. Photography lets me capture all that. Have you ever been photographed before? 
RYAN: I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes. 
RYAN: Jan. 
RYAN: Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand? 
RYAN: Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel. 
RYAN: Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia. 
RYAN: Jim. I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community. 
RYAN: Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me. 
RYAN: Just give us the address. We'll look it up online. 
RYAN: Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet. 
RYAN: Just put it out of your mind. 
RYAN: Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides. 
RYAN: Just started. 
RYAN: 'Kay. 
RYAN: Keep going.   
RYAN: Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me. 
RYAN: Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not. 
RYAN: Kelly don't do this. 
RYAN: Kelly, come on. 
RYAN: Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt. 
RYAN: Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it. 
RYAN: Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend. 
RYAN: Kelly, you insulted the gentleman. Please apologize. 
RYAN: Kelly, you re here. 
RYAN: Kelly. 
RYAN: Kelly... 
RYAN: Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too. 
RYAN: Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott. 
RYAN: Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, "Hey cop, you like donuts?" then we drive off. No, he just stayed there.   I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser.   No, not that one. 
RYAN: Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking. 
RYAN: Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View? 
RYAN: Let's bail.  
RYAN: Let's be adults about this. Let's have sex one more time. And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing. 
RYAN: Let's get a drink. 
RYAN: Let's see what a delivery guy costs. 
RYAN: Like Frodo! 
RYAN: Literally. 
RYAN: Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James.  
RYAN: Living in the moment. 
RYAN: Look at that old dude and his rolodex go. 
RYAN: Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it. 
RYAN: Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone.  
RYAN: Look, I know I've tapped you so hard. 
RYAN: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me. 
RYAN: Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself. Over time with enough volume, we become profitable. Financial 
RYAN: Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call. 
RYAN: Look, uh, Mr. Bart... 
RYAN: Looks like they forgot the power cord. 
RYAN: Love it. Go. 
RYAN: May I go first? 
RYAN: Maybe we should get some air. 
RYAN: Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love? 
RYAN: Maybe. 
RYAN: Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there. 
RYAN: Me too. 
RYAN: Michael and everybody, umm... 
RYAN: Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on. 
RYAN: Michael let me go. Let me go Michael. 
RYAN: Michael,  can I talk to you a second? 
RYAN: Michael, do you think I could get a space heater - 
RYAN: Michael, how's it going, bro? 
RYAN: Michael, please.  
RYAN: Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving. 
RYAN: Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy. 
RYAN: Michael, you haven't even heard-- 
RYAN: Michael. 
RYAN: Michael. 
RYAN: Michael. 
RYAN: Michael? Are you done yet? 
RYAN: Mm-hmm. 
RYAN: Mmm-hmm. 
RYAN: 'Morning.   Wow. Good morning Dwight. 
RYAN: Most dorm rooms don't even have that. 
RYAN: My favorite branch. How's everybody doing? 
RYAN: My mom also makes the best salsa. 
RYAN: My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted. 
RYAN: My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes... 
RYAN: Na. 
RYAN: New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today. 
RYAN: Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night.  I run into Vince Vaughn. 
RYAN: Nice. 
RYAN: Nice. Right back where I like you.  Can you make ten copies of this for me? 
RYAN: Nice. Send me a postcard. 
RYAN: Nick. 
RYAN: Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you. 
RYAN: No don't take that, give that back! 
RYAN: No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good. 
RYAN: No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians? 
RYAN: No Kelly, he s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake. 
RYAN: No no no. 
RYAN: No no, I want to go. 
RYAN: No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can! 
RYAN: No you don't. 
RYAN: No you don't. 
RYAN: No you weren't. 
RYAN: No! I will... go. 
RYAN: No, don't. Don't do that. 
RYAN: No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment. 
RYAN: No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person. 
RYAN: No, I said your idea was stupid. 
RYAN: No, it's whomever. 
RYAN: No, man. You're-- you're fine. 
RYAN: No, no, no, no, no. 
RYAN: No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair. 
RYAN: No, no, no. Sir, don't listen. 
RYAN: No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun. 
RYAN: No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red! 
RYAN: No, not yet. 
RYAN: No, she's lying. 
RYAN: No, Stanley, do you - 
RYAN: No, that was mandatory. 
RYAN: No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams! 
RYAN: No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept. 
RYAN: No, this little guy is mine. 
RYAN: No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw? 
RYAN: No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married. 
RYAN: No, you don't... 
RYAN: No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye. 
RYAN: No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it. 
RYAN: No. 
RYAN: No. 
RYAN: No. 
RYAN: No. 
RYAN: No. 
RYAN: No. 
RYAN: No. 
RYAN: No.  
RYAN: No.  We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system. 
RYAN: No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do? 
RYAN: No. It would cause me too much pain. 
RYAN: No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here. 
RYAN: No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK. 
RYAN: No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself. 
RYAN: Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks. 
RYAN: Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago. 
RYAN: Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up. 
RYAN: Now I have it. 
RYAN: Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control. 
RYAN: Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, "Tracks of my Tears"? 
RYAN: Oh gross. 
RYAN: Oh my god! 
RYAN: Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities. 
RYAN: Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now. 
RYAN: Oh! 
RYAN: Oh!  Fix  means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink! 
RYAN: Oh!  We still have our jobs. 
RYAN: Oh! Did you do this on purpose? 
RYAN: Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net. 
RYAN: Oh, awesome. 
RYAN: Oh, how did I not guess that? 
RYAN: Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story. 
RYAN: Oh, my God. 
RYAN: Oh, no, I didn't know. 
RYAN: Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call. 
RYAN: Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch. 
RYAN: Oh, no. 
RYAN: Oh, so close. Eighty-one. 
RYAN: Oh, thanks, man. 
RYAN: Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly. 
RYAN: Oh, that's nice. 
RYAN: Oh, this guy is having a breakdown. 
RYAN: Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox. Kelly's 
RYAN: Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one. 
RYAN: Oh, yeah, totally. 
RYAN: Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just... 
RYAN: Oh... 
RYAN: Oh... 
RYAN: Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time. 
RYAN: Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side? 
RYAN: Ok thanks Michael. 
RYAN: OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)?????? 
RYAN: Ok, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor season six?   Anyone know Joanna on that show?   In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that. Indistinguishable. So... 
RYAN: Ok, I'm going to establish time frames. 
RYAN: Ok, to what? 
RYAN: OK, what's up? 
RYAN: OK. 
RYAN: Ok. 
RYAN: Ok. 
RYAN: Ok.  Of course. 
RYAN: Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas.   Where do you wanna go? 
RYAN: OK. OK. 
RYAN: OK. Should we get started? 
RYAN: OK. This is... 
RYAN: OK... 
RYAN: Okay well, that's a relief! 
RYAN: Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back. 
RYAN: Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't see too many museums around here." 
RYAN: Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77. 
RYAN: Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right? 
RYAN: Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today. 
RYAN: Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles. 
RYAN: Okay, I'm turning it off. 
RYAN: Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off? 
RYAN: Okay, no. 
RYAN: Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn t the fact that I m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp! 
RYAN: Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today. 
RYAN: Okay, so you are not going to reveal in any way that we're broke. 
RYAN: Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment. 
RYAN: Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one- 
RYAN: Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy. 
RYAN: Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito. 
RYAN: Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing? 
RYAN: Okay. 
RYAN: Okay. 
RYAN: Okay. 
RYAN: Okay. 
RYAN: Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that. 
RYAN: Okay. I won't let you down.  
RYAN: Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in- 
RYAN: Okay. You have to break up with Darryl. I already typed out a text message for you. All you have to do is press "send". 
RYAN: Okay... 
RYAN: Okay... uh, sorry? 
RYAN: On my God. You re so embarrassing. My mom would say the best stuff, though. 
RYAN: One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can. 
RYAN: One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have... 
RYAN: One second. 
RYAN: Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you. 
RYAN: Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education. 
RYAN: Out. 
RYAN: Outsourcing and consolidation of competition. 
RYAN: Pack my--? 
RYAN: Pam's better at that stuff 
RYAN: Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this. 
RYAN: People keep calling me a "Wunderkind"; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word. 
RYAN: Perfect. 
RYAN: Please don't listen to my phone calls. Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space. 
RYAN: Prison sounds great. 
RYAN: Probably, yes. 
RYAN: Profound man, your husband. 
RYAN: Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now? 
RYAN: Quick question. 
RYAN: Quit it! 
RYAN: Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he s hot. 
RYAN: Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper. 
RYAN: Really? 
RYAN: Right this isn't the U.S. Government. 
RYAN: Right. 
RYAN: Right. Okay. 
RYAN: Right. Think different, from Apple. 
RYAN: Robert I hate to interrupt. But I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac idea. 
RYAN: Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man. 
RYAN: Robert, you are too kind. 
RYAN: Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon. 
RYAN: Rock the house! 
RYAN: Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today. 
RYAN: Ryan Howard. Bob 
RYAN: Sabre. It s time to come home. 
RYAN: Say  hi , Drake. 
RYAN: Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing. 
RYAN: Scranton suits you. 
RYAN: Seems like it's leaning one way. 
RYAN: Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy. 
RYAN: Sixty thousand dollars a year. 
RYAN: Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know. 
RYAN: Smokey's dead. 
RYAN: So elephant in the room, I have your old job. 
RYAN: So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book.  
RYAN: So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family. 
RYAN: So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff? 
RYAN: So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions?  So where's the sales office? 
RYAN: So who's leading this thing, anyway? 
RYAN: So word on the street is she has a boyfriend. 
RYAN: So, how are you? 
RYAN: So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh? 
RYAN: So... 
RYAN: Soda. 
RYAN: SoHo's mostly lofts but OK. 
RYAN: Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana. 
RYAN: Sometimes he brings more costumes. 
RYAN: Sorry man. 
RYAN: Sorry, dude. 
RYAN: Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it? 
RYAN: Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting. 
RYAN: Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. 
RYAN: Stop calling us  guys . 
RYAN: Stop flustering me, everybody! 
RYAN: Stop that! Stop that! 
RYAN: Stop. Stop it Andy. 
RYAN: Take care, man. 
RYAN: Take the call, friend. 
RYAN: TBD. Phyllis? 
RYAN: Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat. 
RYAN: Thank you everybody. 
RYAN: Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you. 
RYAN: Thank you very much. 
RYAN: Thank you, Erin. Woof! 
RYAN: Thank you. 
RYAN: Thank you. 
RYAN: Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly. 
RYAN: Thank you. Whatcha got there? 
RYAN: Thanks. 
RYAN: Thanks. 
RYAN: Thanks. 
RYAN: That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington. 
RYAN: That--- I, um... cool. Well maybe I'll see you around. 
RYAN: That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version. 
RYAN: That is not correct. 
RYAN: That is so awesome man! 
RYAN: That looks great. 
RYAN: That s why my foundation   The Dream for a Wish Foundation   is going to put them out of business. They re not going to know what hit them. 
RYAN: That was your choice; don't put that on me. I'm just going on a little trip. 
RYAN: That we're having any problem at all. 
RYAN: That's a little derivative. 
RYAN: That's a test prep for business school. 
RYAN: That's actually a test prep book. 
RYAN: That's all he wrote? 
RYAN: That's because you didn't bring a jacket. 
RYAN: That's good. They're creative, you're not. 
RYAN: That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand. 
RYAN: That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to? 
RYAN: That's really not the trend in vampires right now. 
RYAN: That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team. 
RYAN: That's what I told him. Thanks.  
RYAN: That's... great, I... that's awesome. 
RYAN: That's... That's not the point! 
RYAN: The company's probably going under, though. 
RYAN: The domain name. Yeah, they do. 
RYAN: The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever. 
RYAN: The glasses are a little...  
RYAN: The other way. 
RYAN: The problem with having "It" or "the X-factor" or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say. 
RYAN: The temp agency wants to know what you think. 
RYAN: The Washington University Public Health Fund. 
RYAN: Then do it. 
RYAN: There's no connection between the origin story and the quest. 
RYAN: They had no yams. 
RYAN: They have business classes there? 
RYAN: They really didn't like me. 
RYAN: They said something about Zach Braff. 
RYAN: They were out of yams. I got you creamed spinach. 
RYAN: Things have been generally good. 
RYAN: Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot-- 
RYAN: This guy owns his own beet farm. 
RYAN: This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups? 
RYAN: This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use. 
RYAN: This is a one time thing, you know that right?  
RYAN: This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site. 
RYAN: This is company-wide, Dwight. 
RYAN: This is from the sun. 
RYAN: This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country. 
RYAN: This is not funny, man, let me down. 
RYAN: This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it. 
RYAN: This is... totally unnecessary. 
RYAN: This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best. 
RYAN: This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day.   
RYAN: This poem would crush you! 
RYAN: This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas. 
RYAN: Thought you checker my Tumblr? 
RYAN: Threatening you? No.  
RYAN: To both these bears. 
RYAN: To madness. 
RYAN: To the annex? Where... Kelly is? 
RYAN: Tough. 
RYAN: Twenty. 
RYAN: Twice. 
RYAN: Two HR reps. 
RYAN: Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert? 
RYAN: Ugh. 
RYAN: U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company! 
RYAN: Uh huh. 
RYAN: Uh yeah, we'll meet you there. 
RYAN: Uh, fun jeans. 
RYAN: Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably. 
RYAN: Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that. 
RYAN: Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything. 
RYAN: Uh, is that a vibrator? 
RYAN: Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under. 
RYAN: Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean? 
RYAN: Uh, no thanks, I'm good. 
RYAN: Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company. 
RYAN: Uh, okay, two? 
RYAN: Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um - 
RYAN: Uhm... 
RYAN: Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby. 
RYAN: Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He "liked" my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning. David 
RYAN: Um, I don't... 
RYAN: Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so... 
RYAN: Um, loneliness. Maybe women. 
RYAN: Um, okay, so, um, listen. I know about your diabolical plan. 
RYAN: Um... 
RYAN: Um...  Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. 
RYAN: Um... also-- 
RYAN: Um... God, so many, Nellie! 
RYAN: Um... let's um, let's keep our clothes. 
RYAN: Um... unless you really, really want it back. 
RYAN: Um... Yeah, absolutely. 
RYAN: Unreal. 
RYAN: Updating emergency contacts. 
RYAN: Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here. 
RYAN: Wait, can you go back? 
RYAN: Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions. 
RYAN: Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks. 
RYAN: Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding. 
RYAN: We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time. 
RYAN: We can spend a couple days there. 
RYAN: We can't do this Dwight. 
RYAN: We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way. 
RYAN: We did it ! 
RYAN: We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask... 
RYAN: We have actual work to do. 
RYAN: We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming. 
RYAN: We heard about the punch. 
RYAN: We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest. 
RYAN: We re gonna be together forever. 
RYAN: We should get a drink later. Catch up. Pick me up around eight? 
RYAN: We totally should. 
RYAN: Wear something nice. 
RYAN: Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean? 
RYAN: Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid? 
RYAN: Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is. 
RYAN: Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.' 
RYAN: We'll have to talk about this. 
RYAN: Well here's what I've been doing around here. It's for a series on exposure in the workplace. 
RYAN: Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so- 
RYAN: Well it is business, but not as usual. 
RYAN: Well suggest something else then! Don't just... 
RYAN: Well that was funny, that's why. 
RYAN: Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face. 
RYAN: Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably. 
RYAN: Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower. 
RYAN: Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is? 
RYAN: Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night... 
RYAN: Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend. 
RYAN: Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum. 
RYAN: Well, I updated it. 
RYAN: Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive. Kelly's 
RYAN: Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim. 
RYAN: Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know. 
RYAN: Well, it sounds like you know what you want.  It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up? 
RYAN: Well, it's empty. 
RYAN: Well, it's tight, as with any start-up. 
RYAN: Well, today was a fantastic waste of time. 
RYAN: Well... you look great. 
RYAN: We're back. 
RYAN: We're behind. 
RYAN: We're never getting back together. 
RYAN: We're not doing this today. 
RYAN: We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some? 
RYAN: We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now. Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick. 
RYAN: What about a long sleeve T? 
RYAN: What about this bottle of power drink? 
RYAN: What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now. 
RYAN: What are the criteria for going? 
RYAN: What are those, a men's ten? 
RYAN: What are you doing here? 
RYAN: What are you talking about? 
RYAN: What did you think of the presentation? 
RYAN: What do you make, secretary? 
RYAN: What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic. 
RYAN: What is your problem?  Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me. 
RYAN: What line of work you in, Bob? 
RYAN: What size shoes are you guys? 
RYAN: What the hell?   
RYAN: What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for? 
RYAN: What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing. 
RYAN: What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls. 
RYAN: What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What? 
RYAN: What?  
RYAN: What's her address?  
RYAN: What's that? 
RYAN: What's the dress code on this? 
RYAN: What's the halal option? 
RYAN: What's the hard way? 
RYAN: What's the occasion? 
RYAN: What's up Facebook? 
RYAN: What's up? 
RYAN: What's up? Nice to meet you. 
RYAN: What's your number? 
RYAN: What's, uh, going on here? 
RYAN: When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking "I'm a little too old for this." And I was five. 
RYAN: When people see this presentation, they re gonna  in their pants. 
RYAN: When was China founded? 
RYAN: Where is it? 
RYAN: Where is Tibet? 
RYAN: Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here? 
RYAN: Who is Mao? 
RYAN: Who is your emergency contact?  
RYAN: Who uses calling cards anymore? 
RYAN: Who was that? 
RYAN: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. 
RYAN: Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about... 
RYAN: Whoa, whoa. 
RYAN: Whoo! 
RYAN: Whoopi Goldberg. 
RYAN: Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to? 
RYAN: Why are you being so weird about this? 
RYAN: Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough. 
RYAN: Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse. 
RYAN: Why is that secret?  
RYAN: Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his...  
RYAN: Why no kids? 
RYAN: Why not? What are you doing? 
RYAN: Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey. 
RYAN: Why wouldn't they let me dance? 
RYAN: Will do. 
RYAN: Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T? 
RYAN: Will you marry me Holly? 
RYAN: Will you roll those dice with me? 
RYAN: With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me. 
RYAN: With gift baskets. 
RYAN: With vodka, you're the best. 
RYAN: Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright? 
RYAN: Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you.  I just sent myself a Woof.  
RYAN: Woooo! 
RYAN: Wow. 
RYAN: Wow.  
RYAN: Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat? 
RYAN: Write a book. 
RYAN: Write it down. 
RYAN: WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach. 
RYAN: Yeah I make originals too. 
RYAN: Yeah me too. 
RYAN: Yeah that's great. 
RYAN: Yeah! 
RYAN: Yeah! 
RYAN: Yeah! 
RYAN: Yeah! I'm too hot anyway. 
RYAN: Yeah! That was the idea. 
RYAN: Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday. 
RYAN: Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z. 
RYAN: Yeah, close one. 
RYAN: Yeah, discuss these things-- 
RYAN: Yeah, I figured. 
RYAN: Yeah, I liked them too. 
RYAN: Yeah, I might stop by. 
RYAN: Yeah, I think I can handle it.

RYAN: You helped me get off drugs! 
RYAN: You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever. 
RYAN: You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it. 
RYAN: You know what you're doing. 
RYAN: You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.

STANLEY: But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot! 
STANLEY: But... why Dwight? 
STANLEY: Can I also be a boss? 
STANLEY: Can t you just leave? 
STANLEY: Can we expect any payroll interruptions? 
STANLEY: Can you promise that? 
STANLEY: Cancel wallpaper. 
STANLEY: Can't say. 
STANLEY: Can't you see I'm urinating? 
STANLEY: Chocolate. 
STANLEY: Co-manager of what? 
STANLEY: Come on people, you know the rules of the game now. 
STANLEY: Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't... 
STANLEY: Deangelo, you're going to starve to death.  
STANLEY: Did I say "Messina?"  
STANLEY: DID I STUTTER? 
STANLEY: Did you not tell the security guard we were working late? 
STANLEY: Did you say 'Koi pond'? 
STANLEY: Did you tell him how sick of him you were? 
STANLEY: Do I need my jacket? 
STANLEY: Do not care. 
STANLEY: Do we have to play? 
STANLEY: Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis? 
STANLEY: Do you have any idea how to run an office? 
STANLEY: Do you want us to look for 'em? 
STANLEY: Don t be pushy Jim. It s tacky. 
STANLEY: Don't talk to me. 
STANLEY: Don't tell me how to do my business. 
STANLEY: Dwight, I know these programs. "Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow." 
STANLEY: Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply? 
STANLEY: Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha  
STANLEY: Dwight. 
STANLEY: Eee. 
STANLEY: Eh... 
STANLEY: Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before. 
STANLEY: Excuse me. 
STANLEY: Excuse me? 
STANLEY: Fair enough. 
STANLEY: Fantastic. 
STANLEY: Fantastic. 
STANLEY: Fine. 
STANLEY: Fine. Here it 
STANLEY: Fine. How are you? 
STANLEY: Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team. 
STANLEY: Four Splenda. Are you crazy? 
STANLEY: From Argentina. 
STANLEY: Fruity and delicious. 
STANLEY: Get off me! 
STANLEY: Get the damn phone. 
STANLEY: Get us out of this! 
STANLEY: Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she... 
STANLEY: Go in there and just ask the man what it means. 
STANLEY: Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here. 
STANLEY: Good day. 
STANLEY: Good news that you found our leads? 
STANLEY: Goodbye.  
STANLEY: Goodnight. 
STANLEY: Goooood bye. 
STANLEY: Got an hour? I'll try to explain. 
STANLEY: Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier. 
STANLEY: Great. 
STANLEY: Ha ha ha! And you just said, "Hi! Hi! Hi!" Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old! 
STANLEY: Has it really been ten years? 
STANLEY: Has potential to be your best idea yet.  
STANLEY: Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police! 
STANLEY: He ain t coming. 
STANLEY: He can top that." 
STANLEY: He was good. 
STANLEY: Heh heh.   David 
STANLEY: Heh, heh, heh. 
STANLEY: Helllloooo! 
STANLEY: Hello Meredith. 
STANLEY: Hey guys. 
STANLEY: Hey! 
STANLEY: Hey, it s five o clock.  
STANLEY: Hi. 
STANLEY: Hmm? 
STANLEY: Hmm? 
STANLEY: Hmmm.  Thank you. 
STANLEY: Hmmm... 
STANLEY: Hmmm... 
STANLEY: Hmmmpt. 
STANLEY: Hmpf! 
STANLEY: Hold it! 
STANLEY: Holiday wishes. 
STANLEY: How  bout you want us to work harder, pay us more. 
STANLEY: How about make-believe land has anything you want? 
STANLEY: how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal. 
STANLEY: How did a mosquito get in here? 
STANLEY: How did Ryan use it? As an object? 
STANLEY: How did you get in my car? 
STANLEY: How does that qualify him to run a branch? 
STANLEY: How is that going to work? 
STANLEY: How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days? 
STANLEY: How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure. Window treatment 
STANLEY: How many times do you need to take a stroll? 
STANLEY: How on earth are we supposed to sell ? 
STANLEY: How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus. 
STANLEY: Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream! 
STANLEY: Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me. 
STANLEY: I admire your culture's success in America. 
STANLEY: I agree. 
STANLEY: I am not changing the way I do my files. 
STANLEY: I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check. 
STANLEY: I am not going to apologize to you. 
STANLEY: I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot. 
STANLEY: I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house. 
STANLEY: I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I'm telling someone how to do somethin'. I go on with a long description and then I say,  and shove it up your butt.  It s stupid, but it s my thing now. 
STANLEY: I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job. 
STANLEY: I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel.  I really couldn't be happier. 
STANLEY: I did, my wife's name is Terri. 
STANLEY: I didn't hear a phone. 
STANLEY: I didn't say that. 
STANLEY: I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did. 
STANLEY: I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They're always complaining. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too? Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital? 
STANLEY: I do not think that is funny. 
STANLEY: I don t know, because we re not friends. 
STANLEY: I don't care what you call my team. 
STANLEY: I don't care. 
STANLEY: I don't celebrate Kwanzaa. 
STANLEY: I don't know about anyone else. But it was a good summer for me. I lost seven pounds. And you know what? I'm just gonna take five days off anyway. 
STANLEY: I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out. 
STANLEY: I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word. 
STANLEY: I don't know. 
STANLEY: I don't know.   
STANLEY: I don't like cake anymore 
STANLEY: I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that. 
STANLEY: I don't think he even uses the bathroom. 
STANLEY: I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here. 
STANLEY: I don't want it. 
STANLEY: I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas! 
STANLEY: I don't want to stay until seven again this year. 
STANLEY: I get it.   You need to see more? 
STANLEY: I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it. 
STANLEY: I got one queen size bed. 
STANLEY: I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters. 
STANLEY: I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years. 
STANLEY: I had Mexican food. 
STANLEY: I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this. David 
STANLEY: I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like.   Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted. 
STANLEY: I have an idea for your weekend. 
STANLEY: I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life. 
STANLEY: I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother. 
STANLEY: I have. 
STANLEY: I heard that. 
STANLEY: I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please. 
STANLEY: I know how to plug something in. 
STANLEY: I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha!  
STANLEY: I know, I just read it on the sign. 
STANLEY: I like what we have. 
STANLEY: I ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster. 
STANLEY: I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds. 
STANLEY: I love Philly. Dirty town. 
STANLEY: I m on break. 
STANLEY: I mean I'm learning nothing. 
STANLEY: I missed you too. 
STANLEY: I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them. 
STANLEY: I need to know... 
STANLEY: I prefer   Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona. 
STANLEY: I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn t work then. And now look what he s doing to us. 
STANLEY: I think I did. 
STANLEY: I think I do. 
STANLEY: I think it's because of my sales record. 
STANLEY: I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson. 
STANLEY: I thought you were killed by Polluticorn. 
STANLEY: I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die. 
STANLEY: I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful. 
STANLEY: I usually take a siesta about now. 
STANLEY: I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day. 
STANLEY: I want my money back. 
STANLEY: I was. 
STANLEY: I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did Michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius?  Sometimes I say crazy things. 
STANLEY: I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat.   
STANLEY: I will not work in a roach billboard. 
STANLEY: I will NOT.  
STANLEY: I would die. 
STANLEY: I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense. 
STANLEY: I would like to stay. This pertains to me. 
STANLEY: I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on! 
STANLEY: I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are. 
STANLEY: I... 
STANLEY: If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice. 
STANLEY: If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him. 
STANLEY: If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly. 
STANLEY: If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You re not making any sense. 
STANLEY: If you do that, you're going to have to put out. 
STANLEY: If your hat hits me in the face one more time-- 
STANLEY: If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister. 
STANLEY: I'll get over it. 
STANLEY: I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow. 
STANLEY: I'm about to die! 
STANLEY: I'm counting on you, Michael. 
STANLEY: I'm done. 
STANLEY: I'm going back inside. 
STANLEY: I'm going to die. CPR 
STANLEY: I'm going to go look at the Internet. 
STANLEY: I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan? 
STANLEY: I'm in.  
STANLEY: I'm listening. 
STANLEY: I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that? 
STANLEY: I'm not disabled and neither are you. 
STANLEY: I'm not driving with him.  
STANLEY: I'm not feeling well. I need to sit down. 
STANLEY: I'm not sitting in a wheelchair. 
STANLEY: I'm okay with the logic of it. 
STANLEY: I'm on the phone. 
STANLEY: I'm out. 
STANLEY: I'm outta here. 
STANLEY: I'm sorry? 
STANLEY: I'm taking my dumplings. 
STANLEY: I'm taking the dumplings for my wife. 
STANLEY: I'm the same way with horny people. 
STANLEY: I'm with Pam. Chairs. 
STANLEY: I'm... um, Catholic. 
STANLEY: In January? 
STANLEY: In the African-American community- 
STANLEY: In the box. 
STANLEY: Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off. 
STANLEY: Is he right about that? 
STANLEY: Is he still doing his boycott? 
STANLEY: Is it nice outside? 
STANLEY: Is it white wine? 
STANLEY: Is that from the machine that was in your office? 
STANLEY: Is that it? 
STANLEY: Is that it? 
STANLEY: Is that supposed to be me? 
STANLEY: Is this an overnight? 
STANLEY: Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday? 
STANLEY: It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down. 
STANLEY: It could be out of your hands Michael. 
STANLEY: It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt. 
STANLEY: It s all gone. I didn t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant. 
STANLEY: It wasn't me. 
STANLEY: It's a bad bet. 
STANLEY: It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things. 
STANLEY: It's all about my bonus. 
STANLEY: It's collard greens. 
STANLEY: It's collard greens. 
STANLEY: It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate. 
STANLEY: It's just that we need to know. 
STANLEY: It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot... 
STANLEY: It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too. 
STANLEY: It's my bio-feedback machine.. 
STANLEY: It's not right. I don't like it. 
STANLEY: It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.  
STANLEY: It's too little. Use the phone. 
STANLEY: It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people... 
STANLEY: It's whatever you want.  
STANLEY: It's your job. 
STANLEY: I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas. 
STANLEY: I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off? 
STANLEY: I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now it's my favorite song. 
STANLEY: I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly. 
STANLEY: I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office. 
STANLEY: Just some chef. 
STANLEY: Just transfer the damn call. 
STANLEY: Keep talking all you want. 
STANLEY: Last year, five years ago... 
STANLEY: Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod. 
STANLEY: Leave it woman! 
STANLEY: Leave me alone, dammit. 
STANLEY: Let me get back to my desk right now. 
STANLEY: Let's just make this kid open this damn car. 
STANLEY: Life is short. "Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse." That's one of my mottoes. 
STANLEY: Liquid. 
STANLEY: Look for your stapler! 
STANLEY: Mailboxes, Etc. 
STANLEY: Make it 100. 
STANLEY: Marry me Holly. 
STANLEY: Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank.  And you did fire him. 
STANLEY: Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs? 
STANLEY: Me too.  
STANLEY: Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories? 
STANLEY: Michael, are you that blind? 
STANLEY: Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday. 
STANLEY: Michael, don't listen to them. 
STANLEY: Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home?  
STANLEY: Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home? 
STANLEY: Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa. 
STANLEY: Michael. 
STANLEY: Michael? 
STANLEY: Michael? A word? 
STANLEY: Mind? Nothing would delight me more. 
STANLEY: Mm, how many bedrooms? 
STANLEY: Mm, swish. 
STANLEY: Mmhmm, happy birthday. 
STANLEY: mm-hmm.  
STANLEY: Mmhmm. What? 
STANLEY: Mmhmmm. 
STANLEY: Mmm!  Ugh! 
STANLEY: Mmmm... chewy. 
STANLEY: Money. 
STANLEY: Money. 
STANLEY: Money. 
STANLEY: More meetings and- 
STANLEY: Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson. 
STANLEY: My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised. 
STANLEY: My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems. 
STANLEY: My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? . Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no? 
STANLEY: My mini bar is oddly out of rum. 
STANLEY: My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously.  
STANLEY: Need a hand? 
STANLEY: Next stop pies!  
STANLEY: Night, everybody. 
STANLEY: Ninety nine cases..yeah. 
STANLEY: No , the blue team. 
STANLEY: No I didn't. 
STANLEY: No I'm not. 
STANLEY: No one is ready for this. You can t be ready for this. We don t even know what this is. 
STANLEY: No question. 
STANLEY: No way. 
STANLEY: No you will not. 
STANLEY: No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants. 
STANLEY: No, I'm done. 
STANLEY: No, Michael, No.   
STANLEY: No, you didn t. Sick of you and your ooh  
STANLEY: No. 
STANLEY: No. 
STANLEY: No. 
STANLEY: No. 
STANLEY: No. 
STANLEY: No. 
STANLEY: No. I want Tropical Christmas. 
STANLEY: No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again. 
STANLEY: No. Um-um. 
STANLEY: Nobody likes that stuff except for you. 
STANLEY: Nope. Starts with an H. 
STANLEY: Not a gun. 
STANLEY: Not again... 
STANLEY: Not enough lobster. Side order. 
STANLEY: Not maybe. Yes or no. 
STANLEY: Not me. 
STANLEY: Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars. 
STANLEY: Not your staff, Michael. You. 
STANLEY: Now we re talkin . 
STANLEY: Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs. 
STANLEY: Oh my God! 
STANLEY: Oh my God! David 
STANLEY: Oh my God. 
STANLEY: Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause. 
STANLEY: Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all? 
STANLEY: Oh, for the love of God. 
STANLEY: Oh, great. 
STANLEY: Oh, hello.  
STANLEY: Oh, I do. 
STANLEY: Oh, I don't know. 
STANLEY: Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there.   
STANLEY: Oh, is today Recyclops Day? 
STANLEY: Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here. 
STANLEY: Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind. 
STANLEY: Oh, my god. It s called a garbage can. 
STANLEY: Oh, no, I m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up. 
STANLEY: Oh, no, that's ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact. 
STANLEY: Oh, sure, we talk all the time. 
STANLEY: Oh, sweet mother of God. 
STANLEY: Oh, thanks. 
STANLEY: Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses. 
STANLEY: Ohhh  Mrs. 
STANLEY: Okay, I need a drink. 
STANLEY: Okay, um... 
STANLEY: Okay. It's called Who Would You Do? 
STANLEY: Ooh, bring it over. 
STANLEY: Ooh. 
STANLEY: Ooh-hoo, look at that baby  
STANLEY: Or do you only drink with your kids? 
STANLEY: Or him. 
STANLEY: Oscar! 
STANLEY: Over the course of this documentary I ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some 
STANLEY: Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie? I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy. Blood Drive 
STANLEY: Pass. 
STANLEY: Pass. 
STANLEY: Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead. 
STANLEY: Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic. 
STANLEY: Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! 
STANLEY: Pigeons. 
STANLEY: Please. A little further. 
STANLEY: Put those away before you hurt yourself. 
STANLEY: Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson. 
STANLEY: Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time. We ran out last year, remember? 
STANLEY: Seems recent. 
STANLEY: She does. But neither of them know about Lydia. 
STANLEY: She's in middle school. 
STANLEY: She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni 
STANLEY: She's upstairs talking to Charles. 
STANLEY: Shh! 
STANLEY: Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow? 
STANLEY: Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her. 
STANLEY: Show some pride. This is crap. 
STANLEY: Shuckin  your peas. 
STANLEY: So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out? 
STANLEY: So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard. 
STANLEY: So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it? 
STANLEY: So I'm not fired. 
STANLEY: So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now? 
STANLEY: So we've got what, another 20 minutes? 
STANLEY: So you and Bob are looking at a historical house? 
STANLEY: So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin.  
STANLEY: So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh? 
STANLEY: So? 
STANLEY: Some actress, whether shes hot. 
STANLEY: Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words. 
STANLEY: Son, you ve lost your mind. I m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator. 
STANLEY: Sounds like a hoot. I'm in. 
STANLEY: Stanley Hudson. Bob 
STANLEY: Still behind. 
STANLEY: Super. 
STANLEY: Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now. 
STANLEY: Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava. 
STANLEY: Texas justice. 
STANLEY: Thank you so much.  
STANLEY: Thank you!  
STANLEY: Thank you, Michael. 
STANLEY: Thank you.  
STANLEY: That doesn't make you a boss. 
STANLEY: That is a dangerous precedent. 
STANLEY: That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now. 
STANLEY: That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?! 
STANLEY: That s Benji. Oh, he s precious. That s a healthy-looking baby. Mrs. 
STANLEY: That s none of your damn business. 
STANLEY: That s pizza. 
STANLEY: That's better.   
STANLEY: That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day. 
STANLEY: That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river. 
STANLEY: That's not what a hate crime is. 
STANLEY: That's ok. 
STANLEY: That's one book. You've got two others. 
STANLEY: That's right. 
STANLEY: That's right.  
STANLEY: That's where nosey'll get you. 
STANLEY: The flirtatious tickling. 
STANLEY: The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to. 
STANLEY: The Kardashians is a good show. 
STANLEY: The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns. 
STANLEY: There he is! 
STANLEY: There was a car. 
STANLEY: There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon. 
STANLEY: There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible. 
STANLEY: There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card. 
STANLEY: These are all the same? 
STANLEY: They are not. 
STANLEY: They aren't salespeople! 
STANLEY: They re like the new Jim and Dwight. 
STANLEY: They said I should talk to you. 
STANLEY: This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me. 
STANLEY: This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs. 
STANLEY: This is an abomination. 
STANLEY: This is not natural. 
STANLEY: This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day. 
STANLEY: This is Pretzel Day. 
STANLEY: This is ridiculous. 
STANLEY: This is ridiculous.  
STANLEY: This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day. 
STANLEY: This meeting. 
STANLEY: Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day. 
STANLEY: To the. 
STANLEY: Trust me. It only gets worse. 
STANLEY: Try mose1234. 
STANLEY: Ugh. I don t want to sit through a whole concert of that. 
STANLEY: Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat. 
STANLEY: Uh hmmmm... . 
STANLEY: Uh huh. 
STANLEY: Uh, we don't have any safety mittens 
STANLEY: uh-huh. 
STANLEY: Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No. 
STANLEY: Unbelievable. 
STANLEY: Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you? 
STANLEY: We all saw you do it. 
STANLEY: We all think you don't have a surprise. 
STANLEY: We deserve to know. 
STANLEY: We do not wanna hear about this. 
STANLEY: We get that every year. 
STANLEY: We get to go home? 
STANLEY: We just need to hear your plan for our raise. 
STANLEY: We know exactly what holiday you're referring to. 
STANLEY: We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael! 
STANLEY: We sell better? 
STANLEY: We sit close. 
STANLEY: We ve got all afternoon to talk about that. 
STANLEY: Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays...  
STANLEY: Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven. 
STANLEY: We'll never have to buy meatballs again. 
STANLEY: Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.

STANLEY: Well... 
STANLEY: We're not friends. I didn't think about it. 
STANLEY: We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree? 
STANLEY: What about confidentiality? 
STANLEY: What are we supposed to do? They keep undercutting us on price. 
STANLEY: What are you doing? 
STANLEY: What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? 
STANLEY: What are you talking about? 
STANLEY: What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here. 
STANLEY: What does that mean? 
STANLEY: What have we here? 
STANLEY: What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that? 
STANLEY: What is? 
STANLEY: What kind of food?

STANLEY: Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear. 
STANLEY: Yeah, I got a game. It's called "work hard so my kids can go to college." 
STANLEY: Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid. 
STANLEY: Yeah, who's a little girl now?  
STANLEY: Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles. 
STANLEY: Yeah. 
STANLEY: Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo. 
STANLEY: Yep, looks that way. 
STANLEY: Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea.  
STANLEY: Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space. 
STANLEY: Yes, I m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds. 
STANLEY: Yes, please let us know. 
STANLEY: Yes, what is this about? 
STANLEY: Yes. I had a heart attack. I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire. I feel like I'm working in my own casket. 
STANLEY: Yes... 
STANLEY: You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams. 
STANLEY: You brought balloons to a play? 
STANLEY: You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning. 
STANLEY: You can't cancel a holiday. 
STANLEY: You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you? 
STANLEY: You could feed the hungry. Us. 
STANLEY: You don't have our attention. 
STANLEY: You find anything? 
STANLEY: You gotta be kiddin' me. 
STANLEY: You have just spit on my face. 
STANLEY: You just ignore their carp. 
STANLEY: You just put it back in your pocket. 
STANLEY: You lucky son of a bitch. 
STANLEY: You must have been scared out of your mind. 
STANLEY: You really like her, huh? 
STANLEY: You said bring a toothbrush. 
STANLEY: You said we were getting bonuses. 
STANLEY: You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early. 
STANLEY: You said, we could bring our families. 
STANLEY: You still had eight weeks more than we did. 
STANLEY: You two better watch yourselves. 
STANLEY: You want the lead? 
STANLEY: You want us to apologize to you? 
STANLEY: You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins. 
STANLEY: You're always asking for our attention. 
STANLEY: You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me? 
STANLEY: You've been meatballed!  
STANLEY: Yup. 
STANLEY: Zero.

STILLS: Oh, I m sorry Pam. 
STOP: Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also. 
STORY: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv. The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says "Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt."  And that was an improv. Um, the real way is that I found a flyer. 
STRIPPER: Hey, did somebody order the chef special? 
STRIPPER: Hi, boys!

SUGGESTION: "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression". Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression. 
SUPERVISOR: Back to work, shoe bitch! 
SUSAN:  Thank you.  
SUSAN: Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here. 
SUSAN: Andy. 
SUSAN: Andy? 
SUSAN: Answer the question, please. 
SUSAN: Aw, let me see- 
SUSAN: Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me. 
SUSAN: But it is something. 
SUSAN: Do you not want me here? 
SUSAN: Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup.  
SUSAN: For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here? 
SUSAN: Got it. 
SUSAN: Have you had any? 
SUSAN: Hello nice to meet you. 
SUSAN: Hello. Oh call me Susan please. 
SUSAN: Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today. 
SUSAN: Hi. 
SUSAN: I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert. 
SUSAN: I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that. 
SUSAN: I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he? 
SUSAN: I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping. 
SUSAN: Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine. 
SUSAN: It's a date. 
SUSAN: It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either. 
SUSAN: Jim... 
SUSAN: Maybe after all this settles down... 
SUSAN: Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he? 
SUSAN: No games? 
SUSAN: No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him. 
SUSAN: Oh, Ryan. 
SUSAN: Oh, that is so cute- 
SUSAN: Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don t we just let it go. 
SUSAN: Robert... 
SUSAN: So what happens next? 
SUSAN: That's not true, is it? 
SUSAN: Uh I could work in customer service. HR even. 
SUSAN: Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer. 
SUSAN: Well it was really nice to meet you Brian. 
SUSAN: Well make that a red wine and I ll tell you my animal rankings . 
SUSAN: Well, different circumstances. 
SUSAN: Who knows? 
SUSAN: Who walks around with their passport? 
SUSAN: Why do you keep looking at my husband? 
SUSAN: Why would you not want me working here? 
SUSAN: Yeah, I thought we really hit it off. 
SUSAN: You didn t say goodbye to your grandma. 
SUSAN: You sure about that? 
SUSAN: Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.

TOBY:   Oh man, thanks, thank you,   thank you, thank you. 
TOBY:   Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica. I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right. I broke my neck. And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now. I still haven't seen the beach. It's nice to have visitors. 
TOBY:  "Suck on this." 
TOBY:  ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted...  
TOBY:  ..Chad Flendermen's kryptonite.  
TOBY:  And the winner is Toby Flenderson. 
TOBY:  And this is Sam. 
TOBY:  Buddy, I think that... 
TOBY:  Come on. 
TOBY:  Creed is eating an apple. I found a potato. 
TOBY:  Excuse me. 
TOBY:  Happy's a funny word. 
TOBY:  He talked the whole time.

TOBY:  Hey everyone. 
TOBY:  Hey Jim. 
TOBY:  Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec? 
TOBY:  Hey, Jim. 
TOBY:  Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin. 
TOBY:  Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible. 
TOBY:  I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know. 
TOBY:  I'm sorry! 
TOBY:  It s everything. 
TOBY:  It's a great stick, right? 
TOBY:  It's all Dwight's. 
TOBY:  John Stamos.

TOBY:  Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some? 
TOBY:  Oh, come on. Andy, no. 
TOBY:  Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before. 
TOBY:  Oh, some kind of... alarm. 
TOBY:  Okay, tell them what you wanted to say. 
TOBY:  Okay, this is, all right, this is silly.   Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope... Female church

TOBY:  So proud of you, Hon. 
TOBY:  Sounds like a EMDP-40. 
TOBY:  That s Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God! 
TOBY:  That they do. 
TOBY:  This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift. 
TOBY:  This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from? 
TOBY:  This one right here. 
TOBY:  To Amsterdam. 
TOBY:  What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin? 
TOBY:  What'd you guys do? 
TOBY:  Why you always got to be so mean to me? 
TOBY:  Wow! Cause...  
TOBY:  Wow, thanks, Michael, I... 
TOBY:  W-What? 
TOBY:  Yeah, I know. 
TOBY:  Yes. 
TOBY:  You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank? 
TOBY: ...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know  I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that. 
TOBY: ...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic. 
TOBY: ...bones. What? 
TOBY: ...feel like I may have glossed over a few... 
TOBY: ...minor points. 
TOBY: 50? 
TOBY: A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler.. 
TOBY: A girl. 
TOBY: A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news. 
TOBY: A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel  was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen- 
TOBY: About seven. 
TOBY: About you and Jan. 
TOBY: Absolutely.  
TOBY: Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going? 
TOBY: Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This is January through March of this year.  
TOBY: Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these. 
TOBY: Ah, pretty good. I finished. 
TOBY: Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall. 
TOBY: Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place. 
TOBY: Ahhh, kay. Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives. 
TOBY: All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay. 
TOBY: All right, come. Sit down, Dwight. 
TOBY: All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it. 
TOBY: All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights. 
TOBY: All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault. 
TOBY: All right, thanks Michael. 
TOBY: All right, well, let s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn t everyone stand? Okay, so... you re being attacked. You ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two. 
TOBY: All right... sorry... sorry about that. 
TOBY: Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So... 
TOBY: Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw. 
TOBY: Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later. 
TOBY: Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club. 
TOBY: Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin. 
TOBY: Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs. 
TOBY: Alright. 
TOBY: Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking... 
TOBY: And I am Bacchus's friend! 
TOBY: And that's how you broke your ankle? 
TOBY: And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer... 
TOBY: And uh, yeah, plus it was hot. 
TOBY: Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy.  It's the original. 
TOBY: Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you. 
TOBY: Andy, you know I can t do that. It d be lying. 
TOBY: Andy? 
TOBY: Any word on those time cards? 
TOBY: Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30. 
TOBY: Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab? 
TOBY: Apparently you called Oscar "faggie" for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie. 
TOBY: Are you all right, Michael? 
TOBY: Are you gonna kiss me? 
TOBY: Are you serious? 
TOBY: Are... are you me? 
TOBY: Aren't the suggestions meant for you? 
TOBY: As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day. 
TOBY: At the gym. 
TOBY: Bears. 
TOBY: Been to Amsterdam. 
TOBY: Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch. 
TOBY: Blah blah blah blah. Jim. 
TOBY: But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll. I-- I'm-- I'm begging you. I just-- I need it more than anything in this world. I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll. 
TOBY: But I mean uh have you talked to her? Is sh  
TOBY: But there aren't... 
TOBY: But why? 
TOBY: Can I talk to you a second? 
TOBY: Can t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean? 
TOBY: Can you stop... 
TOBY: Can't you just not look at his feet? 
TOBY: Casual Fridays are cancelled.   Let's just not do it anymore. 
TOBY: Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist. 
TOBY: Chicken piccata, side salad. 
TOBY: Clean it in your car. 
TOBY: Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour. 
TOBY: Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories. 
TOBY: Come on, Dwight. Get out of here. 
TOBY: Come on, Michael. You're interrupting. 
TOBY: Come on. 
TOBY: Come on. 
TOBY: Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while. 
TOBY: Course you do. 
TOBY: Dead. 
TOBY: Did you bring your passport with you? 
TOBY: Did you even read it? 
TOBY: Did you guys do much stuff together? 
TOBY: Did you? 
TOBY: Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email? 
TOBY: Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But- 
TOBY: Do you know her last name, yet? 
TOBY: Do you see David Wallace in the room right now? 
TOBY: Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel? 
TOBY: Dogs don't do that. 
TOBY: Don't make me be your pony, Kevin. 
TOBY: Don't search my stuff. Police Officer 
TOBY: Dwight, you cannot keep that here. 
TOBY: Eighty-nine. 
TOBY: Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything. 
TOBY: Ernesto! 
TOBY: Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York. 
TOBY: Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey. 
TOBY: Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you. 
TOBY: Fine, I'll take your name off.  So no one will know. 
TOBY: Fine. Good. 
TOBY: Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand... 
TOBY: For you? 
TOBY: Fun? 
TOBY: Generally happy.  
TOBY: Get over there! Get over there! 
TOBY: Give you a name or- 
TOBY: Good luck Gabe. 
TOBY: Good luck. 
TOBY: Good morning, Kelly. 
TOBY: Good morning. 
TOBY: Good. 
TOBY: Great point. 
TOBY: Great. 
TOBY: Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related. 
TOBY: Guys, it's a really big deal.  
TOBY: Guys. Really, it's ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to worry. 
TOBY: Guys... 
TOBY: Happy birthday! 
TOBY: Have a great day! 
TOBY: He couldn't have made it a circle? 
TOBY: He didn't seem like he was joking. 
TOBY: He has a doctor's note. 
TOBY: He- he can't do that. Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal. It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it. 
TOBY: He might start by asking each of you,  Why do you think you re here?  
TOBY: He said that? 
TOBY: He seems fine to me. 
TOBY: He seems fine. 
TOBY: Heh. 
TOBY: Hello!  Hello! 
TOBY: Here.  
TOBY: Here's how I usually handle 
TOBY: Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh... 
TOBY: Hey Dwight. 
TOBY: Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe-  Why? 
TOBY: Hey guys that's really inappropriate. 
TOBY: Hey guys. This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy. 
TOBY: Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep.  
TOBY: Hey I need to talk to you right now. 
TOBY: Hey Kev. 
TOBY: Hey Michael. 
TOBY: Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up. 
TOBY: Hey you wanted to see me? 
TOBY: Hey!  
TOBY: Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy. 
TOBY: Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this? 
TOBY: Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea. 
TOBY: Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls. 
TOBY: Hey, Jim! 
TOBY: Hey, look what I found in the back.  Wanna play? Teach you to throw. 
TOBY: Hey, Meredith. Can I talk to you privately for a second? 
TOBY: Hey, Pam. 
TOBY: Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there. 
TOBY: Hey, Stanley... 
TOBY: Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that.  
TOBY: Hey, this came with the Stamford book.  Can you take care of it? 
TOBY: Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight? 
TOBY: Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara? 
TOBY: Hey, want my sun screen? 
TOBY: Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we?  
TOBY: Hey, what happened? 
TOBY: Hey, what is this? 
TOBY: Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the... 
TOBY: Hey, what's going on? You don't have my permission to do this. 
TOBY: Hey, where do I park? 
TOBY: Hey. 
TOBY: Hey. 
TOBY: Hey. 
TOBY: Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us. 
TOBY: Hey...  you two. 
TOBY: Hi guys. 
TOBY: Hi Pam. Stay. 
TOBY: Hi!  
TOBY: Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb. 
TOBY: Hi, Jan. 
TOBY: Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about- 
TOBY: Hi, Micha- 
TOBY: Hi, nice to meet you. 
TOBY: Hmmm. 
TOBY: Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael. 
TOBY: How are you? Hey. Welcome back.  
TOBY: How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here? Robert 
TOBY: How would we get home? 
TOBY: How? 
TOBY: I already signed it. I was just showing you. 
TOBY: I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict. 
TOBY: I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here. Deleted Scene 2 
TOBY: I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex. 
TOBY: I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this?  
TOBY: I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal. 
TOBY: I can go over it with you. 
TOBY: I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty.  
TOBY: I can refer you to someone to talk to. 
TOBY: I can t. 
TOBY: I can't believe this.  Hey you, ass****! 
TOBY: I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury. 
TOBY: I could loan you a pair of socks. 
TOBY: I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back. 
TOBY: I did leave. 
TOBY: I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael. 
TOBY: I didn't think you were. 
TOBY: I don t know if this is gonna help...Uh... 
TOBY: I don t think that s very common. 
TOBY: I don t... 
TOBY: I don t... I don t... 
TOBY: I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth. 
TOBY: I don't know, I just thought you could include me. 
TOBY: I don't know. 
TOBY: I don't know. 
TOBY: I don't know. 
TOBY: I don't know. No. 
TOBY: I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling. 
TOBY: I don't really think people are in the laughing mood. 
TOBY: I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response. 
TOBY: I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But, if he did intend that? Wow. Genius. 
TOBY: I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room. 
TOBY: I don't think the women in this office - 
TOBY: I don't wanna do this. 
TOBY: I don't... I don't think we can do that. 
TOBY: I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that. 
TOBY: I guess everything's okay. 
TOBY: I have a reasonable right to privacy. 
TOBY: I have good cards. 
TOBY: I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh. 
TOBY: I have very fertile hair glands. 
TOBY: I heard about the hit. Just-- make sure it's off company property, right? 
TOBY: I-- I don t know if there s truth to-- to, uh, to that. 
TOBY: I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby. 
TOBY: I just really like you. 
TOBY: I just though you could add me. I don't see the harm in that. 
TOBY: I just want to... 
TOBY: I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible. 
TOBY: I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking. 
TOBY: I know right? I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic. 
TOBY: I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn t back down from anybody. And he calls people  Kimosabe . 
TOBY: I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica. 
TOBY: I love their sandwiches. 
TOBY: I m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin? 
TOBY: I made it this far, right? What's the point? 
TOBY: I mean for real. 
TOBY: I mean, what s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn t know when it s gonna end. 
TOBY: I might have it in here. 
TOBY: I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't-  
TOBY: I only have $200. 
TOBY: I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did. 
TOBY: I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more.  
TOBY: I should get back to work. 
TOBY: I should not be here. I m in the- I was in the wrong- I m- I m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here. 
TOBY: I think it's better that I... 
TOBY: I think these belong to you.  
TOBY: I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere. 
TOBY: I ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast. 
TOBY: I w-, uh, I would love to give uh- 
TOBY: I want to introduce you to... 
TOBY: I was at a parent-teacher conference. 
TOBY: I was-- I was gonna get the doll. 
TOBY: I was... 
TOBY: I will send this off to corporate. Make sure you hold on to your medical bills. Feel better. 
TOBY: I work here. 
TOBY: I would love that. 
TOBY: I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh.  Flenderson files. 
TOBY: I wouldn't want to do that now would I? 
TOBY: I... guess I forgot. 
TOBY: I... I can't do that. 
TOBY: I'd like to introduce you to my replacement. 
TOBY: I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons. 
TOBY: I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam 
TOBY: If they were dilated... 
TOBY: If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads. 
TOBY: If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something. 
TOBY: If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance. 
TOBY: I--I could--I could talk about it. 
TOBY: I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time. 
TOBY: I'll call. 
TOBY: I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate. 
TOBY: I'm allergic to mushrooms. 
TOBY: I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler. 
TOBY: I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay.  
TOBY: I'm good... 
TOBY: I'm hungry. 
TOBY: I'm just trying to help you Michael. 
TOBY: I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today. 
TOBY: I'm not going to punch you, Michael. 
TOBY: I'm not processing this. 
TOBY: I'm running this meeting. 
TOBY: I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent. 
TOBY: I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan? 
TOBY: I'm sorry. 
TOBY: I'm sorry. 
TOBY: I'm Toby. 
TOBY: I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life. 
TOBY: I'm... here, Jan. 
TOBY: In meetings. Erin and 
TOBY: Is everything okay? 
TOBY: It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in. 
TOBY: It has been a long, lonely winter. 
TOBY: It is enough of this. Everyone, let s go back to work. 
TOBY: It is real, thank you for saying that. 
TOBY: It s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office. 
TOBY: It s interesting that you re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel...  written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu. 
TOBY: It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found. 
TOBY: It was just... 
TOBY: It was obvious... 
TOBY: It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object. 
TOBY: It's a dead animal in an office. You can't... 
TOBY: It's a finicky car... 
TOBY: It's a little tricky, you might have to... take...  
TOBY: It's an EMF hotspot. 
TOBY: It's Beach Day... 
TOBY: It's digital, so just take as many as you want. 
TOBY: It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace. 
TOBY: It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it. 
TOBY: It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it. 
TOBY: It's not. 
TOBY: It's not. It's not. Sit down or I am writing you up. 
TOBY: It's over. 
TOBY: It's probably okay... 
TOBY: It's really not a big deal, Michael. 
TOBY: Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park? 
TOBY: It's so random that I have it. 
TOBY: It's the empanada guy. 
TOBY: It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it? 
TOBY: It's working. I'm doing it! 
TOBY: It's, uh, it's HR stuff. 
TOBY: It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted... 
TOBY: I've been drafting a letter. 
TOBY: I've got some ideas, I guess... 
TOBY: Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you. 
TOBY: Johnny Depp. 
TOBY: Just keep going. 
TOBY: Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today. 
TOBY: Just preparing for the deposition. 
TOBY: Just three single guys. Getting into trouble. 
TOBY: Just to refresh you... . 
TOBY: Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fianc  Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university. 
TOBY: Kevin. His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation. 
TOBY: Lady...you never stop surprising me. 
TOBY: Let s do it. Let s get personal. 
TOBY: Let's just wait and see what happens.  You know? 
TOBY: Let's just wait. 
TOBY: Look at.. Look at me.  
TOBY: Look, you know, in any company there's going to be certain degrees - 
TOBY: Looks like we kicked it.  
TOBY: Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones. 
TOBY: Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know... 
TOBY: Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, "No more s'mores, no more s'mores."  
TOBY: Me? 
TOBY: Me? 
TOBY: Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here. 
TOBY: Michael is like a movie on a plane. You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch. And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what? 
TOBY: Michael Scott, this is Holly. 
TOBY: Michael wasn't invited. 
TOBY: Michael! 
TOBY: Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please? 
TOBY: Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want. 
TOBY: Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side. 
TOBY: Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly... 
TOBY: Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going. 
TOBY: Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now. 
TOBY: Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about. 
TOBY: Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made. 
TOBY: Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking. 
TOBY: Michael, We should contact some experts. You don't know what your doing. 
TOBY: Michael. 
TOBY: Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room? 
TOBY: Michael... 
TOBY: Michael? 
TOBY: Mineral-ey. 
TOBY: Mmhmm. 
TOBY: Mm-hmm. 
TOBY: Mm-hmm. 
TOBY: Mmm-Hm. 
TOBY: More like "Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday."   I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now.  
TOBY: Morning. 
TOBY: My birthday was two months ago. 
TOBY: Nice. 
TOBY: No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors. 
TOBY: No not really... 
TOBY: No! 
TOBY: No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies. 
TOBY: No, I mean he's attracted to other men. 
TOBY: No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do. 
TOBY: No, I'm sorry, it's... 
TOBY: No, it's nothing. We'll just...  
TOBY: No, nah. I don't see it. 
TOBY: No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife. 
TOBY: No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me? 
TOBY: No, No, No. No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it. 
TOBY: No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk.  
TOBY: No, no. 
TOBY: No, no. Andy. 
TOBY: No, no. Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty. 
TOBY: No, they bring it in. 
TOBY: No, they're clean. I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later. 
TOBY: No, uh...  Does anyone have a camera here?  No one has a camera here. Uh... 
TOBY: No, why would I punch you? 
TOBY: No, you hit the road, jack. 
TOBY: No. 
TOBY: No. 
TOBY: No. 
TOBY: No. 
TOBY: No. 
TOBY: No. 
TOBY: No. 
TOBY: No. Can't, can't you just get up yourself? I... You only grilled your foot. 
TOBY: No. It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted. 
TOBY: No. They re just regular men. 
TOBY: Not Jan. 
TOBY: Not much? What's up with you?   Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO.   Hey does blue go with tan? 
TOBY: Note? It's a symphony. 
TOBY: Nothing. 
TOBY: Nothing. 
TOBY: Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you re alive. 
TOBY: Now, we re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe. 
TOBY: Of course not! 
TOBY: Of course. 
TOBY: Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR. 
TOBY: Oh my God! 
TOBY: Oh my god. 
TOBY: Oh my goodness, look. Look at this. 
TOBY: Oh thanks. She's gonna...   oh... 
TOBY: Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know  relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really. 
TOBY: Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges. 
TOBY: Oh, Dwight, we talked about this. 
TOBY: Oh, Happy Birthday. 
TOBY: Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry... 
TOBY: Oh, I don t know. I might turn in early. 
TOBY: Oh, I don't know. 
TOBY: Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat.  
TOBY: Oh, Jesus! 
TOBY: Oh, Jim. Hey. 
TOBY: Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs... 
TOBY: Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll. 
TOBY: Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr? 
TOBY: Oh, one more! 
TOBY: Oh, really good. 
TOBY: Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren t in couple s counseling, are you? Oh, God. 
TOBY: Oh, sure. 
TOBY: Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that. 
TOBY: Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it. 
TOBY: Oh, uh, I don't know, uh... 
TOBY: Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing. 
TOBY: Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on. 
TOBY: Oh, yeah, no, it s okay. I can handle it. Um, so  
TOBY: Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here. 
TOBY: Oh. 
TOBY: Oh. 
TOBY: Oh. 
TOBY: Oh.  
TOBY: Oh... uh... 
TOBY: Oh... yes. 
TOBY: Ohh. 
TOBY: OK I think Oscar would just like if you used "lame" or something like that. 
TOBY: OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah, he told me this morning. And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion. 
TOBY: Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk. 
TOBY: Ok, I mean, I could talk to her. 
TOBY: Ok, look the memo is not about you... 
TOBY: OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today? 
TOBY: Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour. 
TOBY: Ok, you know, Michael... 
TOBY: Okay you know, this-- this is over. 
TOBY: Okay, I m at what s called  the decision point.  
TOBY: Okay, I think we should probably be okay. 
TOBY: Okay, I'm lost. 
TOBY: Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G.  It s all about the groin.  
TOBY: Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements. 
TOBY: Okay, then, Andy. 
TOBY: Okay, this is what s called pre-violent posturing. 
TOBY: Okay, this isn t over. Let s stay focused, okay? We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous. 
TOBY: Okay. 
TOBY: Okay. 
TOBY: Okay. 
TOBY: Okay. And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot. So its-- its all one motion through the-- body. So you stay a little low and there's a twist. You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  Pow! 
TOBY: Okay. Good point... 
TOBY: on our policy. 
TOBY: Oop. 
TOBY: Oscar says I checked out huh? Huh.  
TOBY: Ow! Ow! 
TOBY: Pam, can I talk to you for a second? 
TOBY: Pete s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat. 
TOBY: Please sit down. 
TOBY: Radiant. 
TOBY: Really, really funny. 
TOBY: Really? 
TOBY: Really? She's dating? 
TOBY: Really? Today? 
TOBY: Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony. 
TOBY: Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience  
TOBY: Ryan, is, uh, dead. 
TOBY: Second? 
TOBY: Sedentary. 
TOBY: See? 
TOBY: Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let s try it. 
TOBY: She's going to be screaming her own last name? 
TOBY: Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons. 
TOBY: So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork. We worked it out. 
TOBY: So great.  
TOBY: So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam? 
TOBY: So this is H.R. This is your desk. 
TOBY: So you have played it before? 
TOBY: So you set him up. 
TOBY: So, her husband, your stepdad? 
TOBY: So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office? 
TOBY: So... okay. 
TOBY: Somehow. 
TOBY: Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's. 
TOBY: Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help? 
TOBY: Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do. 
TOBY: Sure. 
TOBY: Sure. 
TOBY: Sure. 
TOBY: Sure. Wow.   Ow... 
TOBY: Talk to Michael. I gave him the box. 
TOBY: Technically, he's right. 
TOBY: Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly. 
TOBY: Tell me! 
TOBY: Thank you! 
TOBY: Thanks Dwight. 
TOBY: Thanks man!  
TOBY: Thanks! 
TOBY: Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time. 
TOBY: Thanks. 
TOBY: Thanks...  Really, Michael? 
TOBY: That is not mine. I have never seen that before. 
TOBY: That is-- that is a loaded question. 
TOBY: That is unbelievable. 
TOBY: That may have been my fault. 
TOBY: That s true. There s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands? 
TOBY: That was the right decision for me and my marriage. 
TOBY: That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months. What is going on? 
TOBY: That...  
TOBY: That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl. 
TOBY: That's no burst pipe. 
TOBY: That's not a very good Darryl. 
TOBY: That's not random. 
TOBY: That's so cool. 
TOBY: The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy. 
TOBY: The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago? 
TOBY: The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open. 
TOBY: There s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me. 
TOBY: There s two new guys back there with me now. They re in their 20s. And we really get along. 
TOBY: There was no party. 
TOBY: There were two or three 'sorry's in there.  
TOBY: There's a bunch of people back here, maybe... 
TOBY: There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly. 
TOBY: There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse... 
TOBY: These things just have a way of working themselves out. 
TOBY: They do. That they do. 
TOBY: They don t have vaginas. 
TOBY: This here is a radon test kit.  Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out.  This is a radon test kit.  Please don't throw these out.  See them all over the office. 
TOBY: This is a bloodbath. Alright, I m calling this. 
TOBY: This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun. 
TOBY: This is great. My ex-wife's going to be so pissed.   For once daddy's gonna be a hero. 
TOBY: This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it?  I think this is a start of my first friendship. 
TOBY: This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial. 
TOBY: This place, um... 
TOBY: To madness.  
TOBY: To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word. 
TOBY: To your HR representative. 
TOBY: Toby! Yeah! 
TOBY: Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right? 
TOBY: Tough? I put an innocent man on death row. 
TOBY: Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and-- 
TOBY: Uh huh. 
TOBY: Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't... 
TOBY: Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch. 
TOBY: Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week. 
TOBY: Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning... 
TOBY: Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case. 
TOBY: Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority. 
TOBY: Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone. 
TOBY: Uh, yes! 
TOBY: Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself. 
TOBY: Uh... Human Resources. 
TOBY: Uh... it... compliment... 
TOBY: Uh... it's true... 
TOBY: Uh... what was your favorite flavor of... 
TOBY: Uh... wow.... 
TOBY: Uhh, oh boy, oh boy. 
TOBY: Uh-huh. 
TOBY: Uh-huh. 
TOBY: Um, can you make it eleven? 
TOBY: Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now. 
TOBY: Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird. 
TOBY: Um, why don't you go ask him that? 
TOBY: Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot. Thank you for saying it. 
TOBY: Um, yeah. You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour. 
TOBY: Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds. 
TOBY: Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back. 
TOBY: Um... nothing comes to mind.  
TOBY: Um... You might want these orientation materials. 
TOBY: Umm... After my divorce. Yeah. 
TOBY: Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come. 
TOBY: Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose. 
TOBY: We can do this with more privacy. 
TOBY: We can play something more complicated if you like. 
TOBY: We even go to lunch, pick up babes. 
TOBY: We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers. 
TOBY: We should stay to maybe some more traditional models... 
TOBY: We want to go home. 
TOBY: Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65. 
TOBY: Well I guess this weddings not going to happen. I wonder if this is it for them.  Pam's 
TOBY: Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it.  
TOBY: Well let me see... I would, uh... 
TOBY: Well thanks Michael. 
TOBY: Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too. 
TOBY: Well the "fun" is in it.  
TOBY: Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up. 
TOBY: Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau. 
TOBY: Well, Eric's just going over some stuff. 
TOBY: Well, good. We can, uh, throw that one out.  
TOBY: Well, I do. Always ready for adventure. 
TOBY: Well, I don't see it that way. 
TOBY: Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain... 
TOBY: Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case. 
TOBY: Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution. 
TOBY: Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy. Followed her to Scranton. Took the first job I could find in H.R. Later she divorced me. So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R. 
TOBY: Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot. 
TOBY: Well, it's for Angela, so .. 
TOBY: Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art. 
TOBY: Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job. 
TOBY: Well, no. He hates jams. 
TOBY: Well, that has wheels. 
TOBY: Well, that was better. 
TOBY: Well, that would be... 
TOBY: Well, that'll work. 
TOBY: Well, that's... 
TOBY: Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female. 
TOBY: Well, um, it was amazing. It really was, thanks for asking. Um the beaches were pristine... 
TOBY: Well, we could try him out for a little while...  and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in... 
TOBY: Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point. The ladder didn't reach the top shelf. I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  I'll punch you in da mush, see. 
TOBY: Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company. 
TOBY: Well, we still have to do the exit interview. 
TOBY: Well, what s a little while? 
TOBY: Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton? 
TOBY: Well, you can actually fire him. 
TOBY: Well, you know, 'cause of the trains. 
TOBY: Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate. 
TOBY: Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend. 
TOBY: Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will. 
TOBY: We're really not supposed to serve alcohol. 
TOBY: What are, are you doing at my desk? 
TOBY: What did I do? 
TOBY: What do you mean? 
TOBY: What do you need? 
TOBY: What is going on here? 
TOBY: What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins? 
TOBY: What, what happened? 
TOBY: What... you can't... Gabe? Are you... 
TOBY: What? 
TOBY: What? 
TOBY: What? 
TOBY: What? 
TOBY: What? 
TOBY: What? 
TOBY: What? 
TOBY: What? 
TOBY: What? I was just explaining-- 
TOBY: What's going on? 
TOBY: What's something that you... 
TOBY: When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it. 
TOBY: Where are we? 
TOBY: Where? 
TOBY: Which is where? 
TOBY: Who are you seeing? That's gr  
TOBY: Who brought in donuts? 
TOBY: Who looks exactly like you. 
TOBY: Who was the main character? 
TOBY: Whoa. 
TOBY: Who's Jeff? 
TOBY: Why wouldn't it-- 
TOBY: Why? 
TOBY: Why? Police Officer 
TOBY: Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship. 
TOBY: Would you consider this a terrorist incident? 
TOBY: Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is. 
TOBY: Wow, I'd love to take a look at that. 
TOBY: Wow, you just dive right into it. 
TOBY: Wow. 
TOBY: Write your own damn novel. 
TOBY: Yeah, could we... 
TOBY: Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder. 
TOBY: Yeah, hey. 
TOBY: Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure... 
TOBY: Yeah, I could say something. 
TOBY: Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names. 
TOBY: Yeah, I m  
TOBY: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael. 
TOBY: Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off. 
TOBY: Yeah, it's great, isn't it? 
TOBY: Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that. 
TOBY: Yeah, me too. 
TOBY: Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later. 
TOBY: Yeah, sure, what's up? 
TOBY: Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know. 
TOBY: Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his... 
TOBY: Yeah, um... I can t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I ll go put on my cup. 
TOBY: Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have. 
TOBY: Yeah. 
TOBY: Yeah. 
TOBY: Yeah. 
TOBY: Yeah. 
TOBY: Yeah. 
TOBY: Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey. 
TOBY: Yeah. I ll stop by. 
TOBY: Yeah. No, it's uncanny. 
TOBY: Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting. 
TOBY: Yeah. Yeah, I don t think  
TOBY: Yeah... 
TOBY: Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.  
TOBY: Yes, it is your mistake. He s lingering. So annoying. I m gonna kill him. How can I help? I m here. 
TOBY: Yes, uh some people in the office have complained... 
TOBY: Yes. 
TOBY: Yes. 
TOBY: Yes. 
TOBY: Yes. 
TOBY: Yes. 
TOBY: Yes. 
TOBY: Yes. 
TOBY: Yes. 
TOBY: Yes. 
TOBY: Yes. Woman 
TOBY: Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial... 
TOBY: You can only fire Nellie for cause. 
TOBY: You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop?  Or chess club, or? 
TOBY: You can't do that. 
TOBY: You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right? 
TOBY: You can't,  Ow. Look, you cannot push religion. 
TOBY: You don't need to write 'ex'. 
TOBY: You filled them in and faxed them yourself! 
TOBY: You gonna eat all that dog food yourself? 
TOBY: You have to stop.     
TOBY: You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again? 
TOBY: You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff. 
TOBY: You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating. 
TOBY: You know it s not just pregnant women who don t get their due. You know who s gorgeous? Helen Mirren. 
TOBY: You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny. 
TOBY: You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing. 
TOBY: You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking? 
TOBY: You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It s a pregnant Helen Mirren.  
TOBY: You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison  for something he may not have done. 
TOBY: You know, anything that warms you. 
TOBY: You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR. 
TOBY: You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends. 
TOBY: You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school... 
TOBY: You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy.  Keep philosophers busy for awhile. 
TOBY: You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's. 
TOBY: You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair. 
TOBY: You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck. 
TOBY: You re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator. 
TOBY: You really did it... 
TOBY: You remember that. 
TOBY: You solved it? 
TOBY: You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives? 
TOBY: You wanted to see the gooey eye. 
TOBY: You'll see. 
TOBY: Your outfit. 
TOBY: You're into trains? 
TOBY: You're-you're not in it. 
TOBY: You--you might consider pulling it down a touch. It's ri--it's riding up a little high. 
TODD:  And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that.  
TODD:  Oh! 
TODD:  So you two are married to each other now, right? 
TODD:  Where is Johanna? 
TODD:  Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston! 
TODD:  You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the "ass", in Tallahassee! 
TODD: A madhouse? 
TODD: A madhouse? Johanna is as good as rescued. Where do you suppose all the wig makes of London go to obtain their human hair?  
TODD: After you! 
TODD: All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over! 
TODD: Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd. 
TODD: Check it out! 
TODD: Darryl? 
TODD: Didn't know you were gonna be here. How's the toilet? 
TODD: Do you have a ball and chain? 
TODD: Don't give up on me. 
TODD: Fogg's Asylum , why not?  
TODD: Hey what's going on you guys?  Yeahh! Three muska-queers! 
TODD: Hey, did you get that package I left for you? 
TODD: Holly said that? 
TODD: I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom.  
TODD: I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local  talent. 
TODD: I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses. 
TODD: I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox.  
TODD: I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier. 
TODD: Is too! 
TODD: It's gonna be so good. 
TODD: It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do! 
TODD: Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight. 
TODD: Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers. 
TODD: No, I saw you, and you were the only one. 
TODD: No. 
TODD: Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius. 
TODD: She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer. 
TODD: Since when did you learn how to read? 
TODD: Thank you. 
TODD: Thank you. 
TODD: Thanks man, it'd mean a lot. 
TODD: That sounds weird. 
TODD: That's sweet. How's the sex? 
TODD: The bird continues to call. Someone please turn off your... bird. Oh, for the love-turn your phone off! There are signs! 
TODD: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing. 
TODD: There's a little bird fluttering around. Do hope it ceases chirping.  
TODD: Uh, it doesn t include headshots. 
TODD: well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk. 
TODD: Well thanks, will do. 
TODD: Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight! 
TODD: What is the news of my darling daughter Johanna? 
TODD: Why? 
TODD: Why? 
TODD: Yeah. You know how to read... a menu! 
TODD: You found Johanna. 
TODD: You're right. I gotta watch my behavior. 
TODD: You're the guy who booed me. 
TOGETHER: It's showtime. 
TOGETHER: Yes. 
TOM:  Wear a tie much? 
TOM: A noogie? 
TOM: 'Cause you're so smart. 
TOM: Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you. Pete 
TOM: Hey, future baby sis! 
TOM: Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda? 
TOM: Hey. 
TOM: Hoping it'll make our wives take it up a notch. 
TOM: How's it goin'? 
TOM: I'm good. 
TOM: It's been a while. 
TOM: Like she basically has a hobby, for a job. 
TOM: Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin. 
TOM: Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory.  
TOM: Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius. 
TOM: Oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends. 
TOM: Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long! 
TOM: Pam, you've got the greatest smile and you're body is really fine. 
TOM: Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money! 
TOM: So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school? 
TOM: So you work here, huh? 
TOM: That's when I'll do the face, like- 
TOM: The other thing would "get" Jim. 
TOM: We pranked you! 
TOM: Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg? 
TOM: Yeah. 
TOM: Yeah. Right Pam? 
TOM: You don't! 
TOM: Yup. She only knows how to play "When the Saints go Marching In."

TONY: Gardner. 
TONY: I can't work here. I have to quit. 
TONY: I have to go. 
TONY: I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit. 
TONY: I'm sorry! 
TONY: It's just not going to work for me. 
TONY: I'VE HAD ENOUGH! 
TONY: Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms. 
TONY: Let me go! 
TONY: No, please. No. 
TONY: No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table. 
TONY: No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style. 
TONY: No. Was it supposed to be funny? 
TONY: PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else! 
TONY: Put me down right now! 
TONY: Put me down right... 
TONY: Put me down! 
TONY: Thanks. 
TONY: Uh... this is difficult, for me. 
TONY: Yeah, I shook it, I shook it.

TREVOR:  Nothing gets by this guy. 
TREVOR: All right, then it s settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4:00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there s no turning back. 
TREVOR: And that s all off the books? 
TREVOR: But I think I m up for it. 
TREVOR: Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you. 
TREVOR: Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking? 
TREVOR: Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, we re still gonna be your friend. 
TREVOR: I m sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I m gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No! 
TREVOR: I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I m damn good at it. 
TREVOR: If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend.

VAL:  How was that? 
VAL:  Right here? 
VAL:  Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon. 
VAL: All right guys, clear out. 
VAL: Alright. 
VAL: And delivered. 
VAL: Are you asking me on a date? 
VAL: Are you really this lazy? 
VAL: As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe. 
VAL: Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy. 
VAL: Brandon! 
VAL: Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right? 
VAL: Brandon, what the hell are you talking about? 
VAL: Calm down, he's not. 
VAL: Can I help you? 
VAL: Can't wait. 
VAL: Cashmere. 
VAL: Come on.

VAL: Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today. 
VAL: Hey.

VAL: Honey, I am not sleeping with- 
VAL: How you doing? 
VAL: I caught it. 
VAL: I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for? 
VAL: I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues. 
VAL: I think the music left without you. 
VAL: Isn't that just for popsicles? 
VAL: It has been delivered. 
VAL: It's how it has to be. 
VAL: Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work. 
VAL: Me neither. Come here.  
VAL: No, I'm good. Thank you. 
VAL: No. 
VAL: Not bad fellas, you're better than you look. 
VAL: Oh I've got him!

VAL: Ok, thank you. Is that all? 
VAL: OK. 
VAL: Okay, thanks. 
VAL: Okay. 
VAL: Promise me that- 
VAL: Promise me you're going to clean up. 
VAL: Since when does a sweater mean  dressed up ? Am I your grandson? 
VAL: Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay? 
VAL: Thank you. 
VAL: Thanks for the coffee. 
VAL: Thanks, they're from my mom. 
VAL: That's messed up. 
VAL: That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab. 
VAL: That's what I'm sayin'. 
VAL: The Doc crew s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight. 
VAL: Uh, Brandon? 
VAL: What should I wear? 
VAL: Wow. Those are really nice. 
VAL: Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out. 
VAL: Yeah, sure. 
VAL: Yeah, that's her. 
VAL: Yeah, that's true. 
VAL: Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt? 
VAL: Yeah.

VET: Huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. So, other end is best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo because daisy will start to, uh... I was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream. 
VET: Maybe you would think it too!  I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations. 
VET: that's right! 
VET: Uh, no. Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis.

VIKRAM: Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool. 
VIKRAM: Enjoy. 
VIKRAM: Good night. 
VIKRAM: Good night. 
VIKRAM: He seems really confident. 
VIKRAM: He's taking a long time. Is it possible he's bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do. 
VIKRAM: Hey, c'mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know. 
VIKRAM: I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana? 
VIKRAM: I was a surgeon back home. 
VIKRAM: Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice. 
VIKRAM: Oh yeah. 
VIKRAM: Oh, and what about you? Peanut butter flavor again? 
VIKRAM: Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, I'm sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building? 
VIKRAM: Thank you Michael. 
VIKRAM: Uhh, no. 
VIKRAM: Well if you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah. 
VIKRAM: Well this is your home. 
VIKRAM: What sort of investing club is this? 
VIKRAM: Where are we going? 
VIKRAM: You got me. 
VIKRAM: You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same-

WAITER: And your salad, miss. 
WAITER: He just left. 
WAITER: Here we go. Hot plate. 
WAITER: Hi, Mr. Shrute. I've waited on you before. I just wanted to let you know that gratuity is not included in the bill and tips are expected. 
WAITER: I think he was heading downtown. 
WAITER: I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units. 
WAITER: Morning, folks. 
WAITER: No problem. 
WAITER: Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles. 
WAITER: Okay 
WAITER: Sean. Party

WAITER: So you can't pay for your food? 
WAITER: Wow, oh my God, thank you. 
WAITER: Yes sir. 
WAITER: Yes? 
WAITER: You can't. We'll stop you. 
WAITER: You did not. You have no money. And you dined so much. 
WAITER: You were trying to steal food from us? 
WAITRESS: Do I agree about what? 
WAITRESS: Have you decided? 
WAITRESS: I don't really know what that is. 
WAITRESS: I don't really think that we have that. 
WAITRESS: OK. 
WAITRESS: Okay then. And for you sir? 
WAITRESS: Okay. 
WAITRESS: Sorry, no waffles. 
WAITRESS: That's fine. 
WAITRESS: The... what? 
WAITRESS: We don't serve food here. 
WAITRESS: What can I get for 'ya? 
WAITRESS: What're you talking about? 
WALALCE: Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey. 
WALLACE:   Do you have your passport? 
WALLACE:   Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale. 
WALLACE:   No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly. 
WALLACE:  Great job, everybody! 
WALLACE:  Hello? 
WALLACE:  Hey guys. 
WALLACE:  Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later. 
WALLACE:  Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months? David 
WALLACE:  Michael, David Wallace. What is this about dismissing the ad people? 
WALLACE:  Thanks, Andy. 
WALLACE:  Then we ll get him a new set of drums. 
WALLACE: "Michael Scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years." 
WALLACE: "No." 
WALLACE: "What do you want me to say? Come on, he's a nice guy. There were many people that I considered." 
WALLACE: "Yes." 
WALLACE: ...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat! 
WALLACE: 200. 
WALLACE: 350. 
WALLACE: Again! And I m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy? 
WALLACE: All right. Everyone!  
WALLACE: And I know we have a call scheduled for later   
WALLACE: And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge. 
WALLACE: Andy  
WALLACE: Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute  
WALLACE: Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy? 
WALLACE: Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please? 
WALLACE: Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on what I was about to say was Dwight  Oh, I m sorry, I gotta This ll be a second, sorry. 
WALLACE: Dwight? 
WALLACE: Dwight? 
WALLACE: Enough, Andy. Enough! 
WALLACE: Excuse me? 
WALLACE: Excuse me? 
WALLACE: Good, very good. See, told you. Sounds like somebody had a good trip. 
WALLACE: Got your per diem? 
WALLACE: He said that? He s an odd guy, isn t he? 
WALLACE: Here. Scranton.  Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let s go. It s good news. 
WALLACE: Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it. 
WALLACE: Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk? 
WALLACE: Hey, Dwight. It s David. 
WALLACE: Hey, Erin. Is Andy in? 
WALLACE: Hey, honey. How's your day going? Did you do anything cool? 
WALLACE: Hey. 
WALLACE: How could you possibly think this is a good idea? 
WALLACE: Huh? Hey.  
WALLACE: I don t think so. 
WALLACE: I know, Dwight. I know.  Okay. Okay. All righty. You re gonna do great. 
WALLACE: I know. 
WALLACE: I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it. 
WALLACE: I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I d love to contribute to your campaign. 
WALLACE: I was happy to send Michael on this trip. He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire. But this little perk really seemed to turn him around.   And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November. 
WALLACE: I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad. 
WALLACE: It looked fine to me. 
WALLACE: It s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn t wanna know any of it. 
WALLACE: It s okay. Go ahead, Jim. 
WALLACE: It's probably a little of both. 
WALLACE: Jim says he d like some say in the hiring process. 
WALLACE: Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work. 
WALLACE: Jim, what the hell is happening there? 
WALLACE: Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it? 
WALLACE: Michael, sometimes--- 
WALLACE: Michael, the... that's for your food. 
WALLACE: Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack. He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run. Do you want that on your conscious? 
WALLACE: Michael? 
WALLACE: No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to? 
WALLACE: No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry. 
WALLACE: No, we are mad. 
WALLACE: No, we're not. 
WALLACE: Oh my god. 
WALLACE: Oh, 'cause I saw you had shoes on, so I didn't know if you did anything. 
WALLACE: Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go. 
WALLACE: OK. 
WALLACE: Okay, I'll see it tomorrow. 
WALLACE: Okay. 
WALLACE: Okay. David 
WALLACE: Okay. Jim, I m gonna have to stop you right there. 
WALLACE: Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this? 
WALLACE: So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday? 
WALLACE: So you think you ve been too focused on your job? 
WALLACE: So you you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting? 
WALLACE: So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on. 
WALLACE: Sometimes, we--   
WALLACE: Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers. 
WALLACE: Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey! 
WALLACE: The hotel? What, M--- okay. 
WALLACE: There s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I? 
WALLACE: This is weird. 
WALLACE: This isn t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words,  The kind that s good for head shots.  And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it s gonna boost office morale. Now, he s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired. David 
WALLACE: Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired. 
WALLACE: Uh, well, I guess I can t stand in the way of a man s dream. And it seems like you have the gift. 
WALLACE: Uh-huh, but  
WALLACE: Very good. 
WALLACE: Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me? 
WALLACE: We had to pay for it. Cost us thirty five hundred dollars. 
WALLACE: We put the past behind us, though, Andy. 
WALLACE: Well that kind of worked out. 
WALLACE: Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes? 
WALLACE: Well, good luck. 
WALLACE: Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals. 
WALLACE: Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad. 
WALLACE: Well, thanks Dwight. 
WALLACE: What are you talking about? 
WALLACE: What fire? 
WALLACE: What? 
WALLACE: What? 
WALLACE: Where? 
WALLACE: Why do you already have this? 
WALLACE: Will you be the new manager? 
WALLACE: Would you let Charles know that David is here, please? Jim, hey. 
WALLACE: Yeah. 
WALLACE: Yeah. 
WALLACE: Yeah. 
WALLACE: Yeah. 
WALLACE: Yeah. What s up Jim? 
WALLACE: Yeah? Are you ok? 
WALLACE: You can stay on as a salesman, Andy. 
WALLACE: You could have burned down the whole building. 
WALLACE: You sure? 
WALLCVE: Michael, please lets listen for a second. 
WALTER:  Hi. What was that display? 
WALTER: ...not the words... 
WALTER: ...not to say it but if you only knew... More than words is all you have to do to make it real... 
WALTER: Andrew... 
WALTER: Here, give it to me. Okay. Uh, something like...  Saying I love you is... Andy & 
WALTER: I'm eating, Andy. 
WALTER: I'm not going to tell you how impressed I am that you're a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You're a grown man, don't act like a little boy who needs... 
WALTER: It was a nice party, the setting was a little strange. Uh, the food... 
WALTER: It's high but it's not that high. 
WALTER: It's too high. 
WALTER: Just take it down a little. 
WALTER: Money Ball. Walter Jr.'s choice. 
WALTER: Oh, whoa, sure? Really? It's a little tricky. 
WALTER: Okay. Okay. 
WALTER: Pleasure. 
WALTER: So, you all work with Andy. 
WALTER: Uh, yeah, we don't have too long, we have theater tickets. 
WALTER: We really should be leaving. 
WALTER: What do you want to do? 
WALTER: What would you do if my heart was torn in two... 
WALTER: Yes, that makes more sense. Are you all regional managers? 
WALTER: You don't come in yet.  ...I want to hear from you, It's not that I want you... Andy & 
WALTER: You know what, Walter Jr. is here. Why don't you come up and join us? Walter 
WALTER: You said you were running the company. 
WANTED: middle aged black man with sass. Big butt, bigger heart.  I can't do this. 
WARREN: How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system? 
WARREN: What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know. 
WAS: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order. 
WATCHING: easily the west coast. If you're going whale watching on the East Coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called "West Coast Whales'.  Because you're not gonna see them- 
WATCHING: Oh! 
WAY: no, I do not. 
WAY: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens. 
WHITE: Or we can hope for a holiday rally? 
WINNER: under "Special Skills," Mr. Don Feiner put "Juggling."  
WOLF: Do you want this paper? 
WOLF: I am. 
WOLF: I got it. Paintball. 
WOLF: I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad. 
WOLF: It s not very good. 
WOLF: Let s just go, you guys. 
WOLF: Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch. 
WOLF: Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It s over. 
WOLF: Yeah, whether it s me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina  
WOLF: Yeah, you d bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us. 
WOMAN:  Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic?

WRANGLER: She don't wanna turn around. 
WRANGLER: Turn around. Turn around. Turn around! 
WROTE: I'ma love you downstairs tonight...

YOU: Toby and Angela. 
YOU: what does one fiance plus one lover equal? 
YOURSELVES:  Well, how does this work?  
ZEKE:  Absolutely. 
ZEKE:  It s dense. Like bread. 
ZEKE: Blugh. 
ZEKE: Dwight s my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower. 
ZEKE: Dwight's sister. 
ZEKE: Everyone was in the shower. It s a cow shower, so there s like, a ton of people in there. 
ZEKE: Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one. And, Mose was the visionary. Which left me to be the comedian. 
ZEKE: Hey, Dwight. Mose, Mom says 'hi'. 
ZEKE: I could start Monday. 
ZEKE: Party time! Whorehouse! 
ZEKE: Well, you re the bestisch mensch.
