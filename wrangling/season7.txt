[Elevator opens on Andy, who starts lip dub to the Isley Brothers' 'Nobody But Me', joined by the rest of the Office]
Stanley: [to Toby, who's filming] You fallin' behind.
Ryan: [jumps in front of camera] Wuphf.com!
Kelly: Ryan, we're doing the dance!
Ryan: This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
Creed: [Bluetooth rings] You got Creed.
Ryan: -and you jump in front of them.
Kelly: You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
Stanley: Still behind.
Angela: [closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
Andy: Go, go, go, go! 
Michael: [performs magic-tricks while lip-syncing]
All: Streamers! [everyone throws streamers in the air and starts dancing]
Dwight: Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
Phyllis: Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
Stanley: Are you crazy?
Andy: [song ends] Toby, how did we do?
Toby: Well, that was better.
Andy: Whoo! We did it! [everyone starts cheering]
 
Michael: I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did.
 
Andy: Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.
Erin: Yes, of course.
Andy: And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher. 
Erin: Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
Gabe: Hey, guys.
Andy: Hey!
Gabe: Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. 
Andy: Not at all. 
Gabe: I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss]
 
Gabe: I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
 
Erin: Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
 
Andy: Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
 
Pam: [goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
Dwight: From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
Kevin: Well, what if you're cold?
Dwight: Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
Jim: Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear.
Dwight: [drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
 
Dwight: Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
 
Kelly: This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, "Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?" And I'd be like, "blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah," giving you the exact right answer.
 
Luke: Coffee Monkey's arrived.
Oscar: The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
Luke: Here you go, Big O. Tiny. [hands Kevin his coffee] Darryl Hannah.
Darryl: It says decaf. You get me decaf?
Luke: Ooh, yeah. Must've been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, or I could drive all the way back?
 
Darryl: My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him. 
 
Andy: New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
 
Luke: My name is Luke Cooper. I love cinema. My favorite movies are Citizen Kane and The Boondock Saints. 
 
Andy: That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
Michael: He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino.
Oscar: He messed yours up to.
Darryl: He's got to go, Mike.
Michael: It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
 
Jim: Wow, that's a lot of keys.
Dwight: The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
Jim: That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back. 
Dwight: Where?
Jim: I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
Dwight: Give me that.
Jim: Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
Dwight: Yes.
Jim: Go get 'em.
 
Jim: What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life. 
 
Dwight: [Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
Pam: Sorry.
Jim: Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
Pam: It was really funny.
Jim: Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Pam: I love you.
 
Phyllis: Luke? Luke!
Luke: What's up, Venus?
Phyllis: Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
Luke: Uh, if you asked me to do it, I'm sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe.
Meredith: Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp. 
Luke: You don't have to yell.
Michael: Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
Luke: What for? 
Michael: To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
 
Michael: And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew. 
 
Michael: Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
 
Michael: Don't bother Luke.
Pam: Why is there a circle with a line through it?
Michael: That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
Phyllis: Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke. 
Michael: No, it... Yes, okay, right. [erases don't] All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. [writes "Don't" in front of symbol]
Darryl: Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
Michael: Come on. Okay, um... [draws a circle around "Don't" with a line through it] That's as clear as I can make it.
Phyllis: Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
Michael: Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us. 
Dwight: Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
Gabe: That'd be hilarious. Uh, "Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop 'em."
Michael: Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
Dwight: How close?
Michael: Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
Dwight: Yes. Of course.
Toby: Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related. 
Michael: No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.
All: What?
Michael: Luke is my nephew.
Oscar: Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
Michael: Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
Darryl: What's wrong with a level playing field?
Michael: Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
Jim: Oh, man, so many points being made.
 
Creed: I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat. 
 
Michael: God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
Erin: That's a really tight argument.
Michael: Thank you.
Jim: But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus. 
Michael: No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?
Oscar: This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible. 
Michael: Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
Kelly: I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
Oscar: If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Michael: Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "Well, it's in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is. 
Erin: Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
Michael: Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Kevin: Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
Pam: Or enough for everyone?
Luke: No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips.
Oscar: Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips. 
Andy: Clutch cream run, bro.
 
Pam: Get whatever you want, on me.
Jim: You really think you can make it up to me with food?
Pam: I don't know. That usually works.
 
Pam: I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right. 
 
Angela: I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car. 
Michael: Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off! 
Phyllis: Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
Michael: All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
Jim: Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, "I don't own an Ebay store," so...
Michael: Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project. 
Oscar: Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday. 
Stanley: Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
Erin: Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots. 
Michael: I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway. 
Andy: You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.
Michael: Wait a minute. 
Meredith: [breaks into the car] I'm in. 
Michael: Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.
Oscar: Yep, here they are.
Phyllis: Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
Andy: This kid's costing us sales, Michael.
Erin: I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
Michael: No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit. 
 
Jo: Why is this my problem, Michael?
Michael: Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
Gabe: Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
Jo: Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won't fire the boy. 
Michael: You don't have all the facts.
Jo: Which are?
Michael: I love him. 
Jo: Oh, God. How far has it gone?
Michael: No. No. He's my nephew. 
Jo: Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? Cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can't come in my house.
Michael: Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
Jo: If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities.
Michael: I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
Jo: Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys. 
 
Michael: Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other. 
 
Kevin: Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff. 
Pam: Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses "Doors closed" the doors open. Or he presses "lobby" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that? 
Kevin: Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board. 
Pam: Dwight is about to get so Pammed. 
Dwight: Hey, did you SMS text message me?
Pam: Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
Dwight: [as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting "door closed." What?
Pam: There we go. 
Dwight: Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors] Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
Pam: Let's just calm down.
Dwight: Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately. 
Pam: I don't-
Dwight: Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
Pam: Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!
Dwight: Well, don't look, freak!
Pam: Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
Dwight: I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner! 
Pam: You've gotta be kidding me.
 
Michael: Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! [Luke points laser at Oscar's forehead] Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
Luke: What? I'm stopping it. That's what you said. 
Michael: Give me the pointer.
Luke: So you just want me to move it? You're being totally unclear here. I'm just gonna go ahead and move it. [points it at Angela's chest]
Michael: No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously. 
Luke: All right, fine. Fine. I'll just go.
Michael: Okay.
Luke: I'm gone.
Michael: All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-
Andy: Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.
Angela: Michael, do something. 
Meredith: Sack up, man.
Michael: Okay, can I have that? 
Luke: No. 
Michael: Ok, I am going to count down from five. 
Both: Five, four...
Michael: I'm not kidding. 
Both: Three, two, one.
Michael: Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
Luke: No!
Michael: [bending Luke over desk, spanking him repeatedly] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
Luke: What the?
Michael: That's what you're going to do, Luke!
Luke: What the hell was that?
Michael: I had to do that. 
Luke: Hey, [bleep] this! Screw it!
Michael: All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment. 
Kevin: That was awesome!
Stanley: Texas justice. 
Kelly: Yeah, your nephew is so lame.
Creed: He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
Jim: You follow him on Twitter?
 
Creed: Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him. 
 
Gabe: Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private? 
Michael: Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
 
Jim: Pam?
Pam: Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight. 
Jim: I did not do this.
Pam: I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
Jim: This is impressive.
Pam: Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing. 
Jim: Do they call you that?
Pam: They do call me that.
Jim: Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
Pam: Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.
Jim: Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Great.
Dwight: How ya doin'?
Jim: Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
Pam: Stop drinking the water! Stop!
 
Andy: [Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
 
Michael: Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them. 
 
Andy: [Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
 
Gabe: Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst. You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
Michael: That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.
Gabe: Good. Well, that's the spirit.
Michael: I can do that.
Gabe: And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors. 
Michael: Okay. Wait, what?
Toby: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
Michael: Is there another option?
Gabe: The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...] 

Dwight: Wow. Late every day this week. 
Pam: We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic... 
Dwight: Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
Jim: Is there really?
 
Dwight: Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea. 
 
Dwight: Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers. 
Jim: Aaah!
Mose: Aaah!
Dwight: You remember my cousin Mose.
Mose: Welcome children.
Pam: Were you painting in the dark? 
Jim: Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
Dwight: Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
Pam: I don't really think we need... 
Jim: Oh... lets take the tour Pam. 
Pam: Yeah.
Dwight: Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim. 
Jim: These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
Dwight: Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork. 
Pam: And a soy sauce packet. 
Dwight: Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed. 
Jim: Don't beat yourself up. 
Dwight: We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success. 
Jim: Who will be watching the children?
Dwight: No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible. 
Jim: Prove it. 
Dwight: What?
Jim: Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works. 
Dwight: Oh no, no, no. 
Jim: But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good. 
Dwight: I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]
 
Toby: What's something that you...
Michael: This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it! 
 
Michael: Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell. 
 
Toby: Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here. 
 
Michael: I know what you want to ask me. "Did your mom ever see you naked?" 
Toby: We can do this with more privacy.
Michael: So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
 
Dwight: Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
Phyllis: The mall itself or just the stores in the mall? 
Dwight: All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
Ryan: America is one big mall. 
Jim: Did something happen Dwight? 
Dwight: Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim. 
Andy: Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board. 
Dwight: You don't want to know.
 
Toby: I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons. 
 
Phyllis: I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid. 
 
Pam: [on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes. 
Jim: Pam?
Pam: I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
Jim: Everything is going to be ok. 
Pam: Tell me I'm good at sales. 
Jim: You're good... you're good at sales. 
 
Pam: The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
 
Andy: Dwight?
Dwight: What?
Andy: Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the "F" word?
Dwight: Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients. 
Stanley: No you will not. 
Dwight: Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're "appearance"ists!
Jim: Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
Pam: Yeah, what happened Dwight?
Jim: Ok.
Dwight: You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
Pam: So what happened?
Dwight: I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
Kelly: You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to "Pretty Woman" their asses. 
Creed: We should start our own mall!
Erin: Yeah!
Jim: Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
Kelly: What did I say?
 
Kelly: I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out. 
 
Jim: Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
Andy: No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you. 
Dwight: Ok
Jim: Alright. 
 
Andy: Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now? 
 
Toby: Uh... what was your favorite flavor of...
Michael: One hour.
Toby: What?
Michael: One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today. 
Toby: Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk. 
Michael: No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time. 
Toby: Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...
Michael: You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
Toby: Tell me!
 
Toby: I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
 
Michael: Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby. 
 
Dwight: Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
Andy: Pretty Woman.
Dwight: Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
Jim: No, no. I want to hear you tell it. 
Dwight: Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the "trappings" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
Andy: Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like," I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me." And the shop girl goes, "ok". And Julia Roberts goes," You girls work on commission, right?" And the girl is like,"Yeah", and Julia Roberts goes...
Kelly: "Big mistake! Huge!"
Andy: I was telling that... I was telling that.
 
Stanley: How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure. 
Window treatment guy: Who can I speak to in this office about saving on window treatments?
Erin: I don't know. 
Window treatment guy: Is one of you the office administrator? 
Pam: [hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator! 
Window treatment guy: Can I show you a few samples?
Pam: Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all. 
 
Pam: There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
 
Michael: Toby, can I really tell you anything?
Toby: Of course. 
Michael: Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half. 
 
Oscar: Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
Pam: A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that? 
Oscar: Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!
Pam: Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
Oscar: Totally, that's great. 
Pam: I get paid $40,000 per year.
Oscar: Great.
Pam: Maybe $50,000.
Oscar: $50,000?
Pam: No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.
Oscar: That's great. 
 
Jim: Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
Andy: A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
Stanley: Is he still doing his boycott?
Jim: No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
Kelly: You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
Jim: Agreed. 
Dwight: Really?
Oscar: Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching. 
Dwight: Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
Ryan: The glasses are a little... [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
Pam: I liked them.
Kelly: I thought they were kind of cute.
Ryan: Yeah, I liked them too. 
Dwight: I can't see.
Darryl: Say stuff like, "Good morning, Good Afternoon". People appreciate that. 
Dwight: Wait, I see you every day. Can I say "Good month?"
Darryl: I'm telling you how to do this man.
Andy: If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you. 
Angel: Please and thank you go a long way.
Dwight: Copy. Thank you.
Angela: Thank you.
Dwight: Please.
Andy: [in a cockney accent] I think he's got it!
 
Michael: And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf]
Toby: Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories. 
Michael: Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? [pause] Three hours. We're half way done. 
Toby: Oh.
 
Pam: Hey, do you have a second?
Gabe: Yeah.
Pam: Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over. 
Gabe: Right, of course!
Pam: And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.
Gabe: Thank you so much.
Pam: I just think somebody lost the paperwork. 
Gabe: Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
Pam: Yes. Absolutely. Right away. 
 
Toby: You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
 
Andy: [fanfare] 
Jim: We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
Phyllis: Go get 'em Dwight. 
Jim: Wish us luck!
Dwight: Thank you.
Erin: Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
 
Erin: Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
 
Toby: We can play something more complicated if you like.
Michael: This is plenty complicated. 
Toby: So you have played it before?
Michael: I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
Toby: Who's Jeff?
Michael: Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
Toby: So, her husband, your stepdad?
Michael: Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though. 
Toby: Did you guys do much stuff together?
Michael: Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager. 
 
Toby: It's working. I'm doing it!
 
Angela: [coughs for attention]
Dwight: What?
Angela: My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
Dwight: Do you have your card? 
Angela: Yes. Don't forget the pipe. 
 
Toby: Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
Michael: I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
Toby: Why?
Michael: I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
Toby: Dogs don't do that. 
Michael: Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly. 
Toby: I don't know. 
Michael: When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so...
Toby: It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?
Michael: Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
Toby: I'm just trying to help you Michael. 
Michael: You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
Toby: I just want to...
Michael: You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
Toby: [tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.
Michael: Ok.
Toby: I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate. 
Michael: You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these [giving Toby two middle fingers] and call me in the morning. 
 
Pam: Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]
 
Pam: There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone. 
 
Gabe: So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
Toby: Yes.
Gabe: That is not how it seems to me.
Toby: He seems fine.
Gabe: You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior. 
Toby: Heh.
 
Darryl: I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
Pam: We can do that. 
Darryl: Right in here?
Pam: Easily.
Gabe: I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem. 
Pam: But of course!
Gabe: Great.
 
Gabe: The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator. 
Pam: So weird that there is no paperwork. 
Gabe: At all.
Pam: Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America. 
Gabe: Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit...
Pam: Admit what?
Gabe: I don't want to say it. 
Pam: Say it. 
Gabe: Mm-hmm.
Pam: Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
Gabe: Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment. 
Pam: Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle. 
Gabe: Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
Pam: Sure. Anything else?
Gabe: Nope.
Pam: I'll get it right away.
 
Pam: The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards. 
 
Jim: Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Dwight: It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal. 
Jim: Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that. 
Dwight: Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge. 
Jim: That's it. 
Salesman: Let me know if I can help you with anything. 
Dwight: Excuse me sir.
Salesman: Yes?
Dwight: I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
Salesman: I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about that. 
Dwight: You work on commission, don't you?
Jim: Stop, stop, stop. 
Salesman: No, we don't.
Jim: Did you just say you remember him?
Salesman: Of course, but he looks much less threatening now. 
Jim: What does that mean?
Salesman: We had a safety concern. Um... we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back...
Dwight: Good Morning!
Salesman: If he were in accordance with our dress policy.
Dwight: What? 
Salesman: But the blood stained hands...
Dwight: It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
Salesman: I'm very sorry.
Dwight: Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
Jim: Lets just go.
Dwight: You made a big mistake. Huge!
Jim: There it is. Alright. 
Dwight: Aaah!
Jim: That's pretty good.
Andy: After you.
Dwight: [re-entering the store] I'll take the wizard!
Salesman: Oh, ok!
 
Michael: You forged them! You forged the forms!
Toby: You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
Michael: Yes.
Toby: You remember that.
Michael: Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake. 
Toby: Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose. 
Michael: You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... [mimicking Gabe] "I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!" [normal voice] Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!


Erin: Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
Jim: Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
Erin: Did you write this?
Andy: No.
Erin: Who did?
Andy: Steven Sondheim.
Erin: Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
Angela: What the hell is happening?
 
Andy: We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
 
Michael: [cheers loudly after cast finishes singing song] That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
Andy: Like a month ago.
Michael: Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
 
Andy: Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant. 
Erin: I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
Andy: What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.
 
Andy: Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes.
 
Erin: Oh, who else is going?
Andy: Everyone.
Erin: Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
Andy: What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?
Michael: Andy, what time's the show?
Andy: 8pm sharp.
Michael: How long is it?
Andy: Hour forty-five.
Michael: Nope, can't make it. 
 
Michael: They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy's play, they took mine.
 
Andy: Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?
Pam: Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry. 
Andy: Dwight?
Dwight: Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
 
Andy: It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
Michael: I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
Andy: If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer. 
Michael: Wow.
Andy: This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
Michael: I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play. 
Andy: Noishe!
Michael: And scene.
 
Angela: Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight. 
Dwight: Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
 
Dwight: Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her. 
 
Dwight: Give me the punch card.
Angela: No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show. 
Dwight: That is not in the contract.
Angela: Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate?
Dwight: Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
Angela: Thank you.
 
Angela: Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
 
Andy: Hey, how are those salads?
Jim: It's my own fault-
Andy: My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could... 
Pam: We'll keep looking. 
Andy: Yes!
Jim: Really?
Pam: I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
Andy: Oh my gosh, that would be amazing. 
Pam: Yeah. 
Jim: For a lot of reasons.
Andy: Yeah, I know. Neiche!
 
Michael: Oh, hey guys.
Stanley: You brought balloons to a play?
Michael: I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers. 
Phyllis: It's nice, like Up.
Michael: Yes. 
Usher: Excuse me, are you the guy who did an entire Law & Order episode for his audition?
Michael: Nope.
 
Andy: Guys?
All: Hey! Andy!
Andy: You all made it, thank you so much. 
Jim: You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit. 
Andy: She's babysitting?
 
Erin: I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club. 
 
Andy: I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her. 
 
Michael: [trying to stuff balloons below the seats] This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.
Darryl: Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber. 
Michael: No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber. 
Darryl: No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
Michael: Are you kidding me?
Darryl: Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
Michael: All right, I'm sorry. God. 
 
Usher: Excuse me, I think you may be in the wrong seats. [Jim and Pam move a few rows back, next to Michael]
Kelly: Ooooh!
 
Dwight: [whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy. 
Angela: [after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
Dwight: Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss. 
Angela: Oh, Dwight, just move.
Dwight: [whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman. 
 
Kelly: What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
 
Shelby: Michael! Shelby Thomas Weemes, the director. 
Michael: Hello.
Shelby: I promise you that if you keep auditioning with similar gusto...
Michael: Okay.
Shelby: We are going to find a production with a role for Michael Scott.
Michael: Okay.
Shelby: Yes?
Michael: Yes.
Shelby: Good.
Michael: Good.
Shelby: Enjoy the second act. 
Michael: You enjoy the second act.
Shelby: Have a refreshment.
Michael: Thank you. You, too. [steals a bottle of wine from the bar]
 
Angela: Come on, Dwight. 
Dwight: Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
Angela: These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
Dwight: Let's go. 
 
Pam: Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!
Jim: Everything's fine.
Pam: We can relax. 
Jim: We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on. 
 
Meredith: [seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
 
Andy: Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute "break a legs" or "I still love you" type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything. Maybe on my Facebook wall. 
 
Creed: [on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph. 
 
Andy: Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!
Sweeney Todd: You found Johanna.
Andy: That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing]
Sweeney Todd: There's a little bird fluttering around. Do hope it ceases chirping. [audience laughs]
Michael: How is that funny?
Sweeney Todd: The bird continues to call. Someone please turn off your... bird. Oh, for the love-turn your phone off! There are signs!
Andy: Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak. [Michael laughs]
Sweeney Todd: What is the news of my darling daughter Johanna?
Andy: [text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But... 
Sweeney Todd: [yelling] Where is Johanna?
Andy: A madhouse.
Sweeney Todd: A madhouse?
Andy: Yes, a madhouse.
Sweeney Todd: A madhouse? Johanna is as good as rescued. Where do you suppose all the wig makes of London go to obtain their human hair? [Michael tips over wine bottle, which noisily rolls down the theater, and accidentally lets go of balloons]
Andy: Do you think... [bottle rolling] so you think... [bottle rolling, clanking]
Sweeney Todd: Fogg's Asylum , why not? [balloon pops, Kelly screams and baby starts crying]
Pam: Sounds like Cece.
Jim: Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
Pam: [sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!
Jim: Oh, my God. 
 
Andy: [excited] That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
 
Erin: I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
Jim: Okay, this was pretty simple-
Pam: Why are you here?
Jim: [overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed. 
Pam: What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way. 
Erin: I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
Jim: Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Erin: Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital? 
Pam: You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. 
Erin: Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Jim: No, we're good. Thank you, though. 
Erin: Okay. Alright, bye Cece. 
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again. 
Pam: Not together!
 
Michael: [during curtain call for Sweeney Todd] Boo! Boo!
 
Angela: That was more horrifying than Nunsense. 
Dwight: All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
Angela: Where's my car? Come on.
 
Michael: Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots. 
Sweeney Todd: Darryl?
Darryl: Hey!
Sweeney Todd: Didn't know you were gonna be here. How's the toilet?
Darryl: Silent. Look, congratulations.
Sweeney Todd: Thank you. 
Darryl: I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
Michael: Yeah, good job. Well done. 
Sweeney Todd: You're the guy who booed me.
Michael: Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.
Sweeney Todd: No, I saw you, and you were the only one. 
Michael: Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
Creed: Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
Sweeney Todd: Thank you. 
Darryl: You didn't have to boo him.
Michael: Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling. 
Darryl: How would you like it if we booed you?
Michael: That would never happen. 
Darryl: Boo! Boo!
Michael: Okay. I appreciate the feedback. 
Darryl: Boo! Boo!
 
Michael: I don't like that at all.
 
Andy: Are you ready?
Erin: Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
Andy: [pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere.
Erin: Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
Andy: Yeah, me, too. 
Erin: Okay, I kill you now.
Andy: Okay.
 
Dwight: All right, let's do this.
Angela: No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
Dwight: It's okay, I smell. 
Angela: No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
Dwight: No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.
Angela: Well, I won't tell if you don't.
Dwight: I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
Angela: Good night, Dwight. 
Dwight: Good night.
 
Andy: These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here. 
Erin: This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise. 
Andy: Awesome.
Erin: Okay.
Andy: See you later.
Erin: Thank you. 
 
Jim: [attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
 
Pam: This night was a disaster.
Jim: No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
Pam: Yeah? 
Jim: We could put that in orange juice.
Pam: Get it.
Jim: Yeah?
Pam: Let's get our juice on.
Jim: Yeah!
 
Phyllis: Found him!
Michael: Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues? 
Andy: Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Michael: Yeah, I get those every day after work.
Phyllis: Your show was really great, Andy.
Stanley: Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
Andy: It was like amateur hour.
Oscar: It was an amateur production, technically. 
Michael: Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome. 
Andy: Stop just saying that.
Michael: I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.
Andy: Thank you. That feels good.
Michael: I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
Darryl: Andy, sing us another song.
Andy: Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now. 
Phyllis: Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
Michael: Come on, Andy, seriously.
All: Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!
Andy: Okay, all right, all right, all right. 
 
Andy: [sings Macy Gray's "I Try" and everyone joins in]
 
Michael: In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! [imitates vacuum cleaner] I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. [humming theme music] Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.
Shelby: Thanks you.
Michael: No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act. 

Dwight: [driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
 
Mexican Man: [speaking Spanish]
Son: We don't go with that man. I've seen several men go with that man and not come back. 
Mexican Man: [speaking Spanish]
Son: We've lost friends.
Mexican Man: [speaking Spanish]
Son: We don't know what he does with them.
Mexican Man: [speaking Spanish]
Son: I don't want to talk about it anymore.
 
Dwight: I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
 
Nate: Hola amigo.
Dwight: Hola, tu es une buena worker?
Nate: Si, yo muy bueno worker.
Dwight: Y el accento, donde are you from?
Nate: Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia.
Dwight: You speak English?
Nate: Yes, I'm really good at English.
Dwight: Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
Nate: [quietly] Okay.
Dwight: [nods to camera]
 
Angela: [seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
Dwight: That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
Phyllis: Yeah, I got stung up my dress.
Dwight: Poor hornet.
Dwight: [looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
Ryan: But if he doesn't?
Dwight: He'll die.
Kelly: What?
Andy: Uhh, beg your pardon?
Dwight: When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
Nate: [picks up blowtorch]
Kelly: Is that a blow torch?!
Pam: No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees]
Dwight: Interesting choice...
Pam: [Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!
Andy: Very very smart.
Pam: Yeah, go away. [Kelly nodding]
Nate: [picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]
Employees except Dwight: No! No no!
Dwight: A bat! Impressive...
Andy: Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow! [yelling all around the office]
 
Michel: [walks into the office with a large, fake mustache on] Good morning Erin, any mustaches? I mean messages?
Erin: [giggles] Terrific!
 
Michael: There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. [spinning in chair] He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
 
Phyllis: [seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
Michael: [shying away] Look, [sighs] It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
Phyllis: That's no pimple Michael.
Michael: You mean cancer?
Pam: What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
 
Pam: It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
 
Meredith: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
Michael: It is?
Meredith: Yup, just a cold sore.
Michael: Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.
Kevin: I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
Michael: How?
Kevin: Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
Michael: What?
Pam: Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
Meredith: I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Kevin: I never seen herpes on you.
Meredith: Because it's on my genitals, genius.
Kevin: You have a penis?
Andy: Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
Michael: Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
Jim: That was like, ten years ago.
Michael: No! It was like four years ago!
Kevin: Michael, you're at least forty six!
Michael: Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six. [later in his office, places a band-aid over his cold sore]
 
Kelly: Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
Angela: This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
Andy: You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
Kelly: I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
Oscar: I don't even wanna know these things!
Meredith: [walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
 
Michael: How did this happen, how did I get this?
Dwight: Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
Michael: You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
Dwight: What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
Michael: Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
Dwight: You may have...
Michael: Oh my God! What if I did?
Dwight: You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
Michael: Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
Dwight: You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
Michael: There's no way I'm gonna do that.
Dwight: Then I will.
Michael: [makes grunt in attempt to stop Dwight. Dwight hangs up]
 
Dwight: No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
 
Donna: [on phone] Hello?
Michael: Hi Donna. It's Michael.
Donna: Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been?
Michael: I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
Donna: Oh no.
Michael: I can't even say it. H-I...
Donna: Oh my God.
Michael: ...R-P-E-E-S
Donna: Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?
Michael: No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
Donna: Ummm, no.
Michael: Does your stupid husband have it?
Donna: No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
Michael: Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
Dwight: So long Donna! [Michael hangs up]
 
Andy: Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
Stanley: Not again...
Andy: What do you mean again?
Stanley: You're always asking for our attention.
Andy: Maybe like a year ago...
Stanley: Seems recent.
Andy: No, that's...
Oscar: Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
Andy: Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
Phyllis: Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
Stanley: [agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
Andy: It's the world's only international sport! [sits down]
 
Holly: [on phone] This is Holly.
Michael: No this is Holly.
Holly: No this is Holly.
Michael: No this is Holly.
Holly: No, this is Michael Scott.
Michael: Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
Holly: I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
Michael: Oh really? Was anyone killed?
Holly: A lot of people.
Michael: Any nuns?
Holly: Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
Michael: [Dwight looks confused to the camera] Were they in the missionary position? [Holly laughs]
 
Andy: [singing] Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. [stops singing] Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
 
Michael: [still on phone with Holly] Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: We would have twins. [Dwight points towards the corner of his lip, indicating Michael's "herpes"]
Holly: I don't think we'd have kids.
Michael: Mmhmm!
Holly: It was just for a few weeks!
Michael: Mhhmm! We would be married.
Holly: [sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
Michael: Do what?
Holly: You romanticize things.
Michael: I don't romanticize th- [Dwight nodding and mouthing 'Yes you do'] No...
Holly: Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
Michael: He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
Holly: You made ourselves to be more than we were.
Michael: We were more than we were.
Holly: I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
Michael: Ok, alright I gotta go.
Holly: Michael... [Michael hangs up]
Dwight: [to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.
Michael: It didn't come up organically.
 
Jan: [to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
 
Jan: How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
 
Michael: It's nice to see you doing so well.
Jan: Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
Michael: Bringing home the bacon.
Jan: Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
Dwight: I don't understand the reference.
Jan: Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
Dwight: We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
Jan: Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
Michael: [after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us...
Dwight: Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
Michael: He hasn't changed.
Jan: No, so what couldn't wait?
Michael: Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
Jan: Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
Michael: What?
Jan: You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
 
Andy: So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia. [grossed our remarks from around the office as Andy holds p a picture of a nude man]
Erin: Andy...
Andy: What, is it because he's black?
Jim: Nope, it's because it's genitalia.
Andy: Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out]
Jim: Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
Andy: It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's.
 
Jan: No! In the beginning we were not good.
Michael: Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
Jan: Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
Michael: Because we work together.
Jan: No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
Michael: Am I the princess?
Jan: No I'm the princess, and the queen.
Michael: [sighs] Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.
Astrid: Mommy!
Jan: Assy! Awwhhh how was school?
Astrid: It was cool.
Jan: [singing] What did you learn?
Astrid: What did I learn?
Jan: You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
Michael: I have herpes.
 
Michael: I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
 
Andy: Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
Kevin: It feels unbelievable!
Andy: [writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
Kevin: ...unbelievable.
Phyllis: The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
Andy: Express love, magical.
Kevin: It feels amazing!
Andy: Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
Kevin: Yes.
Andy: Then I will write it down.
Creed: The feeling of pure risk.
Andy: I actually had that down in the cons column, but...
Creed: It's thrilling.
Andy: Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk.
Erin: Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex?
Andy: Yes! Thank you! Such as?
Erin: Unplanned pregnancy.
Andy: Yes, unplanned pregnancy.
Kelly: Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
Kevin: Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
Pam: Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
Jim: Good!
Darryl: I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
Jim and Pam: Thank you!
Andy: Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
 
Dwight: Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
Michael: You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
Dwight: Jan knows paper.
Michael: No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
Dwight: Wait, what Holly said?
Michael: Yes, I don't...
Dwight: Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
Michael: I know, I know.
Dwight: Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
Michael: Got it.
Dwight: TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
Michael: I'M TRYING! GOD!
 
Michael: [walks into park with Dwight] Hi stranger! Long time!
Old Woman: Who are you?
Michael: I'm Michael. We dated for a while.
Old Woman: I don't think so...
Helene: Michael?
Michael: Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
Dwight: Come on old lady. Let's go.
Old Woman: What is happening? [Dwight shushes her]
Dwight: Come on.
 
Andy: Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?
Darryl: Condoms.
Andy: Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.
Darryl: Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
Andy: I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all. Anybody?
Pam: Andy that's way too personal of a question.
Andy: Well someone could answer if they want to. [looks at Erin hopefully] Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil. [Stanley laughs]
Andy: What?
Oscar: Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
Andy: Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway. 
Meredith: Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
Andy: I'm doing this for you Meredith!
Meredith: I didn't want you it!
Andy: Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves]
 
Helene: It'll go away in time just don't touch it.
Michael: Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
Helene: What did you think we were?
Michael: Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
Helene: I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show's ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.
Michael: Jerk. [walks off]
 
Dwight: Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
Carroll: So this is the chef's kitchen, which makes it perfect for real entertainers.
Michael: Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
Carroll: Michael.
Michael: Carroll, how are you?
Carroll: I'm great! How are you?
Michael: I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
Carroll: You didn't call my office and ask where I was?
Michael: No.
Carroll: Because the receptionist told me a man called but he only said he was my ex-lover.
Michael: Weird...
Carroll: Yeah.
Michael: He sounds like a nice guy.
 
Andy: I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
Gabe: This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
Andy: How is that relevant to anything?
Gabe: I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
Andy: The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
Gabe: I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
 
Michael: Oh wow another living room!
Carroll: It's a family room.
Michael: You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
Carroll: Michael why are you here?
Michael: Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
Carroll: You know, we all do that.
Michael: I have herpes.
Carroll: What? Did you have that while we were together?
Michael: I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.
Carroll: Oh! Oh, that's what you're talking about?
Michael: Mmhmm, I'm sorry.
Carroll: Did the doctor check it out?
Michael: I'm between specialists right now.
Carroll: Yes, yes Michael. Actually you do make a bigger deal out of things than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date.
Michael: Well I believe in love at first sight.
Carrol: Well so do I, but we didn't love each other at first either. I don't know what you were thinking!
Michael: I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
Dwight: [walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
Carroll: No.
 
Darryl: [Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
Andy: No I'm just sweating.
Darryl: I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
Andy: I'm not crying I'm just sweating.
Darryl: Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
Andy: Ok.
Darryl: Yeah.
 
Darryl: I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
 
Holly: [on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
Michael: Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
 
Oscar: What is this about?
Michael: Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
Oscar: Yes!
Michael: You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
Oscar: What?
Michael: Herpes duplex.
Dwight: It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Michael: I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
Oscar: We were never lovers!
Dwight: I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
Michael: Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
Dwight: Fence with a hole in it..
Michael: Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
Dwight: The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
Michael: An electric car dealership. [Oscar gets up and starts leaving]
Dwight: The democratic primaries,
Michael: Oscar! Think abou- Think! [door slams] 

Michael: Look at that.
Oscar: Huh?
Michael: Nice!
Oscar: I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: She is a beaut!
Dwight: Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
Oscar: Yes, it is.
Michael: Oh, look at that. [pushing bike] Smooth roll.
Oscar: Yeah.
Kevin: You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!
Oscar: Yes.
Meredith: His ass was on that seat? All right!
Kevin: Nice.
Oscar: No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
Kelly: I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Pam: [crashing sound] Michael!
Michael: Oh, god!
Oscar: Oh...
 
Michael: Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.
 
Jim: Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
Michael: I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you. [Pam and Jim begin wheeling him] Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
All: [chanting] Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
Dwight: Yeah!
Pam: Come on, Michael! Yeah!
Jim: Just steer more now.
Michael: [crashes into Jim and Pam's parked car] Oh, my god!
Pam: Not the car!
Jim: No! No!
Michael: Ow! [grunts, stumbles to his feet] You never forget. Whoo!
 
Dwight: How do I look?
Jim: Amazing. How do I look?
Dwight: Normal. Ugly.
Jim: Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
Dwight: Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
 
Dwight: We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
Jim: He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
Dwight: Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
Jim: I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
Dwight: And who is this "the" Steve Nash?
Jim: Phoenix Sun's point guard?
Dwight: No.
Jim: No? Nothin'?
Dwight: No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
Jim: Well, I'm neither of those things, so...
 
Andy: [reading Cornell magazine] Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
Phyllis: What? Is Dan okay?
Andy: No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
Phyllis: Yes.
Andy: "Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.'"
Phyllis: Oh, that's great news for your friend.
Andy: Yeah, yeah, it's great...
Phyllis: You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
 
Andy: I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
 
Dwight: Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
Jim: Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...[motions to lobby]
Dwight: Crap.
 
Dwight: Danny Cordray is the worst.
Jim: Well, by worst, you mean the best.
Dwight: The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
Jim: So, the situation is the worst.
Dwight: Also, he slept with Pam.
Jim: No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing "yes, he did"]
 
Jim: Tell 'em.
Pam: Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
Jim: What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
Pam: That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
Jim: Yeah, I thought you started it.
Pam: No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
Jim: Ahhh.
 
Dwight: I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
Jim: Okay, great-
Dwight: Watch this.
Jim: -I'm just gonna watch.
Dwight: [speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest penis I have ever seen." And I said, "I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." Well, hello Danny!
Danny: Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey.
Jim: [shaking hands] How are ya?
Danny: Good to see you too.
Dwight: What are you doing?
Danny: Oh, I'm just here for the coffee.
Dwight: Like hell you are.
Jim: Dwight!
Dwight: He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
 
Michael: Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea-[cell phone rings] Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?
Jim: Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
Michael: Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?
Angela: What?
Oscar: You are busy! We're in a meeting!
Michael: It's Jim, Okay? Yes.
Jim: Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
Michael: You need the big guns, yes?
Jim: Yes.
Dwight: What'd he say? What did he say?
Jim: The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
Michael: I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. [hangs up] Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
Pam: You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
Michael: [laughing] No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?
Pam: You don't?
Michael: No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.
 
Andy: [knocking] Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute?
Darryl: I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.
Andy: Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
Darryl: If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
Andy: I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
Darryl: Nah. I play for pleasure.
Andy: This is for pleasure.
Darryl: I wouldn't enjoy that.
Andy: I'm willing to pay you.
Darryl: Oh, yeah?
Andy: Yeah.
Darryl: How much?
Andy: Sixty bucks a session.
Darryl: That's crazy money. I'll take forty.
Andy: Yes!
 
Dwight: There he is.
Michael: Oh, no, that's a male model.
Jim: No, that's him.
Michael: That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
Danny: Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.
Michael: Nice to meet you.
Danny: Three of you guys for one sale.
Michael: Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
Danny: Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
Michael: All right.
Danny: It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
Michael: Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
Receptionist: He's ready for you.
Michael: Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--
Jim: Nope, not doing that.
Dwight: I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
Michael: Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
Jim: Showtime!
Michael: It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.
 
Michael: When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-
Steve: Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company.
Michael: You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.
Steve: That's very generous, but-
Michael: And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.
Dwight: He's not kidding.
Michael: Shake it, shake it!
Steve: Michael, I'm going with Danny.
Dwight: Oh.
Steve: Thanks for coming in.
Michael: Okay. Thank you.
Steve: Thank you.
Michael: Thanks, Steve.
 
Dwight: Jim talked too much.
Jim: No, I didn't.
Dwight: Yes, you did.
Michael: Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested. [pounds the elevator button] Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?
 
Michael: How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
 
Michael: You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?
Stanley: We sell better?
Michael: Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?
Stanley: I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
Michael: Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
Stanley: Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
Michael: I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic. [Stanley stands to leave] See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
Phyllis: I could try to seduce him.
Michael: Oh, my god!
Dwight: I know how we can learn his tricks.
 
Dwight: What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
Jim: Is that your office?
Dwight: Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
Phyllis: Uh...
Stanley: I'm outta here.
Phyllis: This is weird.
Michael: You know what this is? This is a stinger.
Jim: A what?
Michael: Like the movie.
Jim: I think you mean The Sting.
Michael: Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.
Jim: Nope. Different movie.
Dwight: The Sting. The Sting.
 
Erin: Your two o'clock. [Danny enters]
Meredith: Thanks, hun.
 
Jim: Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
 
Danny: Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you.
Meredith: Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
Jim: Meredith Van Helsing?
Dwight: Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
Jim: Okay. But what is he more famous for?
Michael: Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
Jim: You know this isn't real TV, right?
Michael: Yes.
 
Darryl and Andy: [singing] Please Mr. President, if you wanna give hope a whirl, bring our troops home safe and sound, says this little girl.
Andy: [in falsetto] Please Mr. President-
Darryl: One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
Andy: Yeah.
Darryl: But you're singing it.
Andy: Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto.
Darryl: No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
Andy: Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
Darryl: Oh, I never sing with soul.
Andy: That's a lie.
Kevin: I could sing it.
Andy: I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
Kevin: But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
Andy: Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
 
Danny: I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.
Meredith: Hel-lo!
Michael: Oh, no, no. No. Don't-
Dwight: People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
Michael: Testify.
Jim: Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
Michael: Yeah, he is that good-looking.
Dwight: He's very, very handsome.
Michael: Okay.
Meredith: That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
Michael: Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.
Meredith: I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
Danny: Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit.
Meredith: What do you mean?
Michael: Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.
 
Andy: [everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
Oscar: It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
Andy: But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
Pam: Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
Andy: I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
Ryan: I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Andy: Rude. And not helpful.
Creed: Well, I really, really, really liked it.
Andy: Well, that...really bums me out.
Creed: You're welcome.
 
Danny: We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?
Meredith: Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
Danny: Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]
Michael: Stay-
Meredith: Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
Danny: I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
Dwight: Oh...
Danny: Well, we'll get this...[Meredith unbuttons]
Michael: Oh!
Dwight: Oh, man!
Meredith: So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
Jim: We gotta get someone else in there right now.
 
Jim: You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
Oscar: That sounds fake.
Jim: What do you mean?
Dwight: I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
Jim: Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
Oscar: Okay.
Jim: So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
Oscar: All right. I can do that. Then what?
Dwight: Then make him pitch to you.
Jim: Yes.
Dwight: We gotta see what he's got.
Jim: Exactly. You can do this.
Dwight: Okay, and remember-you're not gay.
Jim: Stop it! It's gonna be great.
Oscar: Okay.
Jim: And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
 
Oscar: Meredith, I-
Meredith: Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
Danny: Hola. Que tal?
Oscar: Como estas, senor?
Meredith: Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.
Jim: Who else we got?
 
Dwight: Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
Ryan: Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
Jim: Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Michael: Don't let us down.
Ryan: [points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
 
Danny: Yeah, sure.
Meredith: You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
Danny: You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-
Meredith: Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
Michael: No, no, no....
Jim: No, no, no, no...
Michael: I'm goin 'in!
Dwight: Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
Michael: Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
Danny: Michael Scott.
Michael: I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
Meredith: Please to meet you-
Michael: Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
Danny: Hmm.
Michael: I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
Danny: But from where?
Michael: A surveillance room next to this one.
Danny: Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
Michael: Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.
Danny: Or...crazy.
Michael: Well-
Danny: I'm gonna go.
Michael: Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
Dwight: No!
Jim: No, no, no, no.
Danny: Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! [knocking on wall] Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.
Michael: No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
Danny: What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that! [opens door to leave]
Michael: You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
Danny: Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.
Michael: So, you will?
Danny: [opening door again to leave] No!
Michael: Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
Danny: Get out of my way.
Michael: Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
Danny: I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now.
Michael: I know, I know.
Danny: I'm very upset!
Michael: Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
Danny: More freedom.
Michael: I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
 
Michael: Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
Kelly: [bleep] me!
Michael: O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
Kelly: Josh Duhamel.
Angela: Yeah, I can see that.
Michael: No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
Kevin: He's like a better-looking Andy.
Andy: Thanks, Kevin.
Michael: No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
Oscar: It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
Dwight: Michael?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Can I talk to you about something?
Michael: No, you may not.
Dwight: It's about this very announcement you just made.
Michael: I said no.
Dwight: Michael-
Michael: We're not-
Jim: Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Michael: Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don't leave. Don't let him.
Erin: Gotcha. [they go into Michael's office]
Jim: You hired him?
Michael: Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
All: Stay the same.
Michael: Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
Phyllis: It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
Michael: No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.
Dwight: Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
Michael: He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
Stanley: Hmpf!
Dwight: Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
Michael: Good-bye!
 
Darryl: Song's about truth.
Kevin: Yeah.
Darryl: What's something you really care about?
Andy: Reverse snobbery.
Darryl: More universal.
Andy: Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
Darryl: [plays soft chords and sings] Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
Kevin: Oh, nice!
Andy: Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!
Darryl: Go ahead.
Andy: [singing] Which me am I gonna be today?
Darryl: Which me am I gonna be today?
Andy: I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
Kevin: Or the me that stinks.
Andy: Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
Darryl: Oh, don't worry about it.
Andy: Wait. Seriously?
Darryl: Yeah.
Andy: So we're just, like, jamming as friends?
Darryl: One, two, three, hit it.
Andy: Closet full of mes-
 
Danny: Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
Jim: Did ya?
Danny: Yeah. Way ,way, way back.
Jim: I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Danny: Oh. She was not into me.
Jim: Oh.
Danny: Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.
Dwight: You snubbed her.
Jim: Dwight, please.
Dwight: Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too "meh" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing "I wear makeup"] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
Danny: Okay...that's different.
Dwight: Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?
Danny: Uh...I mean-yeah.
Dwight: Welcome aboard.
Danny: Thank you.
Jim: Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?
Dwight: It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]
Danny: Oh.
Dwight: Pleasure.
Danny: Thanks.
 
Michael: This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.
 
Kevin: [singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
All: Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love. Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love and I gave her the croak that meant I love you.
Darryl: I'll be your croak monsieur.
Andy: [falsetto] I'll be your croak madame.
Kevin: Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
Darryl: I find you absolutely ribbiting!
All: Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
Andy: Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
Kevin: Croak!
Andy: Ribbit!
Darryl: Scoopity-splash!
Kevin: Nice.

Andy: What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
Jim: I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
 
Jim: Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
 
Stanley: What's a seven letter word for purse?
Kevin: [sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
Stanley: Nope. Starts with an H.
Andy: [shirtless, wearing only a tie] Handbag.
Stanley: Hmmm. [glances at Andy] Thank you.
 
Andy: Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley's monitor]
 
Michael: [standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales! 
All: Yay! [applause]
 
Stanley: [looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
Pam: [turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]
Dwight: [standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!
Stanley: Night, everybody.
 
Oscar: So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
Kevin: The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
 
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
 
Michael: A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!
 
Pam: People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
 
Jim: Stop. 
Dwight: [has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me. 
Jim: Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
Dwight: To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler. [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
Pam: What?
Dwight: You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
Pam: I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
Jim: [places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!
 
Jim: I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
 
Gabe: [dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
Michael: MACGRUBER!
Todd Packer: Lame. Why don't witches wear panties? 
Michael: Oh, here we go!
Todd Packer: Because they need to grip the broom!
Michael: [laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
Dwight: Lake Erie.
 
Gabe: When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.
Michael: So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
Gabe: That is correct.
Todd Packer: Has anyone started calling you "Gabe-wad" yet?
Gabe: Not here.
Danny: Gabe-wad.
Gabe: Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-
 
Michael: Blackula!
Darryl: Dracula.
Michael: Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
Darryl: Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you. 
Michael: Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
Darryl: I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
Michael: Really? We're good?
Darryl: Yeah. We're cool.
Michael: Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay.
Darryl: What's under your shirt?
Michael: Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
 
Michael: Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing. 
 
Toby: [leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right?
Ryan: It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
Toby: Thanks!
Oscar: Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
Toby: No.
Ryan: No.
Kelly: I get that. I get that.
 
Danny: Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar.
Kevin: You own a bar?
Danny: Public School, at exit 11. 
Oscar: That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
Danny: So. You're all on the list!
Ryan: Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
Creed: Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
Danny: Okay.
 
Kevin: I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
Phyllis: I don't know, they're both handsome.
Dwight: Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
Phyllis: I think he-
Creed: Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
 
Jim: So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
Pam: We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
Jim: That's right.
Pam: Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
Jim: Yikes.
Pam: But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.
Jim: Oh, no.
Pam: And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
Jim: No. No, I'm not gonna-no.
 
Andy: Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
Jim: I don't care.
 
Kevin: I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
Andy: You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in]
Kevin: Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Andy: [removes teeth] Creed's going?!
 
Jim: Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
 
Michael: Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
Darryl: [answers phone] Hello?
Michael: Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
Darryl: I'm good.
Michael: You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
Darryl: This is embarrassing, Michael.
Michael: Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
Darryl: Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
Pam: [leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
Michael: This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
Angela: So, what happened?
Michael: I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
Erin: Oh! [fumbles for phone]
Michael: And we are going to straighten this out.
Andy: Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
Michael: Mmhm!
Gabe: Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]
 
Michael: I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.
Dwight: He went to Gabe behind your back.
Michael: No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.
Dwight: He went over your head to go behind your back. 
Michael: What is taking someone from behind?
Dwight: No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous. 
Michael: It was a good idea, though.
Dwight: Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea. 
 
Andy: Hey, Danny.
Danny: Hey.
Andy: I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.
Danny: I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
Andy: You were?
Kevin: Okay, well then, uh, I mean, maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
Danny: For sure.
Andy: We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.
Danny: What are you talking about?
Andy: Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
Danny: Jim and Pam really don't want you to go?
Kevin: They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
Danny: I'll talk to them.
Kevin: Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
Danny: Okay.
Kevin: Or you're dead.
Danny: Okay.
Kevin: Okay.
 
Erin: Kelly! Great costume!
Toby: Oh.
Angela: KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
Kelly: Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
Oscar: Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
Kelly: Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
Angela: Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?
 
Angela: This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
 
Dwight: Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
Michael: [staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?
Dwight: Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
Michael: Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
Kevin: I am so sorry.
Michael: Oh, you're sorry? 
Kevin: I just thought-
Michael: What did you just thought? 
Kevin: Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry] 
Michael: All right.
Kevin: I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
Michael: Okay.
Kevin: Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
Michael: Well, don't let it happen again.
Kevin: [hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
Michael: I-
Kevin: [bleep] you, Gabe!
Gabe: Okay...
 
Danny: Can you imagine? It's just crazy.
Jim: That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
Danny: Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
Pam: Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.
Danny: Exactly.
Jim: It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about? 
Danny: No! Two or three dates.
Pam: It was two.
Danny: Was it two? I thought it was three.
Pam: No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...
Jim: Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs]
Danny: [laughing] Well, that does not sound like me. 
Pam: Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened. 
Danny: [stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.
Pam: Hmm-mm.
 
Michael: Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
Darryl: I'm not mad. Are you mad?
Michael: You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
Darryl: Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Michael: Okay, that might help. If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody.
Darryl: Mike.
Michael: In front of me.
Darryl: You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
Michael: So that's it.
Darryl: That's it.
Michael: Is it? 
Darryl: Yes.
 
Andy: Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.
Stanley: How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
 
Oscar: I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
Phyllis: Oh.
Oscar: Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
Ryan: Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
Pam: Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
Kevin: Pam. Can you vote for other people?
Michael: Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
 
Michael: Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
Pam: Michael, this is a bad idea.
Michael: What's a bad idea?
Pam: Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
Michael: NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.
Kelly: Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
 
Stanley: [walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword]
 
Oscar: I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
 
Pam: Angela as the nurse!
 
Angela: I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
 
Phyllis: What should we ask?
Michael: Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
Jim: We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Erin: He says no.
Michael: Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
Darryl: No.
Michael: Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
Dwight: Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
 
Dwight: I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth. 
 
Michael: If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
Erin: [hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?
Phyllis: An asset!
Erin: Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.
 
Danny: I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think.
Todd Packer: I don't think you get it.
Danny: Hey.
Jim: Hey.
Danny: This is some party, huh?
Jim: When you work hard, you play hard around here. Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
Danny: Are you serious?
Jim: Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
Danny: You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...
Jim: Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
Todd Packer: Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?
Jim: Nope. 
Danny: Okay. You wanna know? I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
 
Ryan: Fifty seven. Fifty eight. 
Meredith: Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.
Oscar: [reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Erin: Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
 
Pam: I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
Jim: Just tell her the real reason.
Danny: Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
Jim: Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
Pam: I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like "gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why."
Danny: Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky. 
Jim: Hey, man.
Pam: Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
 
Gabe: In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me. 
Michael: Thank you.
Darryl: You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
Gabe: Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open. 
Michael: If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!
Darryl: You said no to this one!
Michael: That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
Darryl: What have you done for me?
Michael: Oh...
Darryl: What have you done for me? 
Michael: Well...
Darryl: Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
Gabe: Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?
Michael: Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
Gabe: Yeah.
Michael: You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
Darryl: I don't understand the point of a hat.
Gabe: You're right, we don't need a hat.
Michael: I am not budging on the hat issue.
Gabe: Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
Michael: Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
Gabe: Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
Michael: Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
Darryl: Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
Michael: Sorry I was a jerk.
 
Michael: Friends fight. Friends fight.
 
Andy: What's up, man?
Darryl: Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
Andy: When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day. Bernard's Regards. 
Darryl: This was your freshman year.
Andy: I started to ask myself, "Do I have big plans here?" I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group? Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.
Darryl: No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
 
Jim: To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
 
Pam: Oh, wow!
Jim: [holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Pam: Aww, my hero!
 
Pam: Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez. 
 
Kelly: If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
 
Ryan: Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
 
Creed: Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.


Pam: I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
Kelly: I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
Michael: That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
Jim: Stop.
Michael: [under his breath] Um... kay. Uh, alright.
Pam: One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Erin: Di-Did you say vampire?
Pam: Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]
Dwight: Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
Pam: Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.
Dwight: [rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh... 
Pam: And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
Dwight: NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
Jim: Elaborate.
Dwight: The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter... 
Pam: I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
Dwight: Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
Jim: So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
Dwight: Yes. I would welcome it.
Jim: [sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
 
Dwight: The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
 
Angela: Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
 
Pam: Cece's getting christened today.
Jim: Big day.
Pam: Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
Jim: Nope. 
 
Michael: Top of the Sunday morning to you.
Andy: And a top of the day to you too, sir.
Ryan: Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Michael: Oh, yes. [mimicking smoking] Doobie-doobie doo.
 
Michael: I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
 
Andy: [looking at Cece, under his breath] Ah, man. [looks at Erin talking to Gabe]
 
Andy: Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
 
Dwight: [handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
 
Toby: Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
 
Michael: [in an old man mobster voice] Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over.
Pam: Oh, Michael, this is just for family.
Michael: But I'm the Godfather.
Jim: It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
Michael: Are you talking to me?
Jim: [whispers to Pam] Ok, your turn.
Michael: Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
Pam: Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.
Michael: [normal voice] I'm not the godfather.
Pam: Okay, thank you.
Michael: [clears his throat] So who is the godfather?
Pam: Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.
Michael: Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?
Pam: No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
Michael: No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
Pam: Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.
 
Michael: I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
 
Church congregation: [singing] We ask you, Lord, come to our aid.
Pastor: Good morning.
All: Good morning.
Michael: Good morning.
Pastor: What a terrific day this is, and not just because the Eagles are playing. [laughter, Kevin giggles]
Pastor: You may have seen the bus out front. Today we also say good-bye to our young adult ministry. They're leaving for three months to build a school for the village of Quimixto, in Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.
Ryan: I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
 
Toby: [stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope... 
 
Female church member: And thank you for your prayers for Justin. We hope for a speedy recovery.
Pastor: Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance? [Dwight and an eldery man stand up at the same time, Dwight stares at him, man sits back down]
Dwight: Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
 
Pastor: Christening calls to repentance, to faithfulness, and to discipleship. We've come to celebrate these babies.
Pam: [looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change.
Jim: Right now?
Pam: Well, she can't bring this up with her.
Jim: Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
 
Jim: [whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
 
Pam: [seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?
Jim: What?
Pam: Honey, no.
Jim: Yes.
Pam: No, no.
Jim: This is happening.
Pam: We have an extra outfit in the bag.
Jim: No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
Pam: You said you checked it.
Jim: I did... say that.
Pastor: At this time, will the families please come join me?
 
Michael: Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.
 
Pastor: Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone that the "Halberts" have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service.
Jim: Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
 
Jim: Okay, "A," Halbert. And, "B," I think a more appropriate statement would be, "The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests."
 
Ryan: For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
Kelly: Try "Jesus."
Dwight: Opus dei.
Male church member: [to Michael] Hi. Good morning.
Michael: Good morning.
Female church member [to Michael]: Good morning.
Michael: Good morning.
Ryan: Hello.
Dwight: Shh, shh, shh.
 
Michael: [walking around and greeting people] How are you? Good morning. Good morning. 
Lady: Good morning.
 
Michael: I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
 
Jim: Hey.
Doug [church member]: I'm Doug Mcpherson, Davey's uncle.
Jim: Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
Doug: Davey.
Jim: Yeah. [Doug walks away]
Pam: Wow.
Angela: Well, this is intimate.
Pam: We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
Angela: You don't know them all?
Pam: Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.
Angela: Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
Pam: [to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
Jim: Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Pam: I don't know. I'm just hungry.
Jim: Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
 
Michael: Oh, after you.
Male church member: Oh, no, after you.
Michael: No, I insist. After me.
Male church member: [laughs] I'm gonna use that one. Have a good lunch.
Michael: Thank you. You too.
 
Stanley: This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
Kevin: I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
Michael: You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch.
Kevin: With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.
 
Girl: Excuse me, everyone, on behalf of the youth ministry that's leaving for Mexico, I just wanted to thank our hosts and tell you about those good-looking guys and gals over there. [group of young adults cheer and applaud]
Ryan: [whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
 
Girl: This is Jessica Ortega. I met her when both she and I were both seven years old when my parents took me to Quimixto on a service trip.
Phyllis: [chuckling] Who takes a kid to Mexico?
Stanley: I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
Michael: Shh.
 
Girl: Right now, Jessica's children have to walk twelve miles to a school with dirt floors.
Michael: No.
Girl: It's gonna be three months of hard work and when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos.
 
Dwight: Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Michael: [overhearing Dwight's conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
Dwight: I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Michael: Are you kidding me? Stop it.
Dwight: I'll call you back.
 
Girl: My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldn't hesitate to save a family member from a burning building, but what if the earth was your building and all the people on it were your family?
Andy: What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
Michael: Shh.
Girl: Thank you. Or should I say gracias?
 
Pam: [sighs] Cece went down.
Woman: [holding up an empty serving dish] What was this? You're out of it.
Jim: Scones.
Woman: I didn't get one.
Pam: Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.
Woman: Is it just the one jug of apple cider? [Pam shrugs, woman walks away]
Pam: Who the heck was that?
Jim: I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
Pam: We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
Jim: All right. And cider.
 
Michael: [pointing to group of young adults laughing] Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.
Stanley: You could feed the hungry. Us.
Oscar: Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
Michael: Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
Darryl: We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Michael: Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
Phyllis: Church isn't a party, Michael.
Michael: Well, it's, it's-
Ryan: Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
Michael: No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.
 
Jim: Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
Mee-Maw: Fine, fine. I guess I'll watch Suzanne's purse and your baby.
 
Michael: [standing in a line saying goodbye to the kids going to Mexico] Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We're proud of you. [starts to walk down through the line and into the bus] Bye. Okay.
 
Michael: [on the bus] Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
Students: Yeah! [cheers, applause]
Michael: [in reference to the team shirts] I'll take a shirt.
Guy: Are you coming?
Michael: If you'll have me, yes.
Guy: Heck, yes.
Michael: Really? [cheers, applause] Thank you. All right.
 
Oscar: [seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
Michael: No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going.
Gabe: Michael, this is irresponsible.
Michael: It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
Darryl: I agree. I think it's superb.
Gabe: Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
Michael: You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
Andy: Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport. 
Guy: [sticking his head out Michael's window on the bus] You don't need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico.
Michael: Hey, right?
Phyllis: Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
Michael: Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
Phyllis: Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
Michael: Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
Dwight: Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
Michael: No, you may not.
Dwight: Gah!
Erin: I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Michael: Thank you.
Andy: [looking at Erin] Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!
 
Andy: I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick. 
Guy: We're actually building them a school.
Andy: Whatever. I won't-I won't stand for it.
 
Michael: [waving goodbye as the bus drives away] See you in a few months.
 
Girl: If the whole world were like you guys, we wouldn't have so many problems.
Michael: Mm. That's not gonna happen.
Andy: We're one in a million.
Girl: I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs and friends and families to do manual labor for three months.
Michael: Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So... 
Andy: Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals... 
 
Toby: [standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?
 
Jim: [seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
MeeMaw: I don't know. I lost the purse too.
Jim: Okay.
 
Andy: Good-bye, Lackawana County.
Michael: How long till we get to Mexico?
Andy: Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
Michael: Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
Andy: I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or... 
Michael: Why aren't they building it themselves?
Andy: They don't know how.
Michael: Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?
Andy: Well, Carla knows.
Michael: Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
Carla: Oh, trying to sleep.
Michael: What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
Andy: Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
Michael: Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
Andy: And the Christmas party.
Michael: And Cinco de Mayo.
Andy: Nah, no. We'll be back before that.
Michael: No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
 
Jim: Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
Phyllis: Here's her carrier, but no Cece.
Jim's Dad: Jim, Jim, I want to give a toast. Where's the little girl of honor?
Jim: I don't know, dad. I don't know.
Doug: I don't mean to bug, but do you know when those subs are due into port? I got a hungry bunch of Mcphersons over there.
Jim: I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
Doug: I think maybe some blonde lady had her.
Jim: A small blonde woman?
Doug: Smaller than me.
Jim: Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
Angela: [as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
Kevin: [reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
Angela: What? Kevin!
Helene: [holding the baby, walks up to Jim] Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby.
Jim: [baby voice] Hi.
Pam: [walks up] Honey.
Jim: [to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
Angela: Did you think I stole your baby?
Jim: What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
Kevin: [gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
Angela: Someone put them in my bag.
Doug: [to Pam] So that was lunch, eh? Mcpherson troop, let's haul out. Rendezvous at Friendly's.
Pam: Did you lose Cece?
Jim: Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
 
Michael: Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
Andy: I can make myself cry.
Michael: Do that. Do it.
Andy: Should I-I got it. I got it. [walks up to the bus driver] Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
Bus driver: Can't stop. We're on a schedule.
Andy: Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
Bus driver: Maybe we'll stop in Tennesseee. It's not safe to talk to a driver.
Michael: [having walked up to the front] Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. [pulls the string to request a stop, makes a dinging sound]
Bus driver: Stopping in Tennessee.
Guy: Hey, is there a problem, you guys?
Michael: Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
Guy: Why?
Andy: Just make him stop the freaking bus!
Michael: Stop the bus, okay?
Carla: Are you okay, sir?
Michael: I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.
Girl: You have plenty left to give. You're doing-
Michael: Blah-di-blah!
Andy: It doesn't matter.
Michael: We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
Andy: If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway.
Michael: Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
Andy: Stop the bus!
Michael and Andy: [shouting and clapping] Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
Guy: Okay, stop the dang bus.
Michael: [bus stopping] Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you.
Another guy: [getting off the bus] Wait for me! [bus drives away] Don't say anything to my parents.
 
Erin: [driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
Michael: Why quick?
Erin: So it's faster.
 
Erin: Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Michael: Is anyone still at the church?
Erin: No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Michael: What? Shut up.
Erin: Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
Michael: It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
Erin: I bet. You guys.
Guy: Can I come? [silence]
Erin: Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Radio: "... banana bread, but Fred Nordquist had no appetite. He was thinking about his pair of new boots. It'd been ten years after all. As he told Mrs. Nordquist, it would take two years to get comfortable with the new boots."

Erin: [to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
Reporter: Police have now surrounded the apartment complex.
Michael: [whispering to Pam] They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
Reporter: It is unknown if he is armed with anything.
Kevin: They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Dwight: [sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Angela: Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Gabe: Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
Erin: It's pronounced wacko.
 
Jim: Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
 
Kelly: Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
Andy: I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
Kevin: No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
Michael: Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! [runs out of conference room.] Come on everybody! [all quickly follow]
 
Michael: [on sidewalk] There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! [all groan]
 
Michael: [collecting pebbles off the street into a jar] Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? [old man voice] Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And I'll tell you what. [shakes jar of pebbles] You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.
 
Erin: Michael!
Michael: Walk with me.
Erin: Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
Michael: [obviously faking being serious the whole time] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
Jim: [confused] Okay?
Erin: Yeah it's a TV show...
Michael: Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
Stanley: I...
Michael: Cancel it! Are you still here? [to Erin] 
Erin: Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Michael: MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
Erin: [sad] Okay, sorry.
Michael: I'm joking.
Erin: Wait which one?
Michael: I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. [Erin laughs] I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
Erin: Good me too!
Michael: You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. [Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party.
 
Erin: I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
 
Kelly: [reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
 
Kelly: And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
 
Angela: Are you going? [to Dwight]
Dwight: Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
Angela: I would watch that.
Dwight: Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
 
Andy: [to Erin] You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
Erin: Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Andy: You would?
Erin: You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Andy: Try and keep me from coming!
Erin: Why would I keep you from coming?
Andy: Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
Erin: Why would I hide it! [giggling]
 
Michael: Kevin!
Kevin: Hey, you going tonight?
Michael: Yes, I am. Are you?
Kevin: Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
Michael: What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
Kevin: No he's not the boss.
Michael: Why did you just say he was the boss?
Kevin: 'Cause, you're the boss!
Michael: Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
 
Erin: [to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
Michael: Uh huh...
Erin: Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Michael: Big...
Erin: Those posters used to be real French ads.
Michael: All right!
 
Gabe: So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and...
Michael: [interrupting] Okay okay okay.
 
Michael: Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!
 
Michael: [tossing pizza dough in the air]
Gabe: You don't really toss the dough. 
Michael: Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. [throws pizza dough, hits the ceiling]
 
Gabe: [walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
Jim: You play? [referring to keyboard]
Gabe: Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
Jim: You can't even do that.
Cece: [crying]
Pam: She's up! Great!
 
Pam: Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
 
Erin: [peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
Phyllis: [to Kelly] Who's that?
Kelly: Finn.
Phyllis: Who's that?
Kelly: Rachel.
Phyllis: Which one's Glee?
Kelly: You have to stop.
Michael: Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin! [turning up volume]
Gabe: [takes remote] It's a little loud...
Michael: Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
Gabe: [lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Michael: Well some of us are trying to have a...
Gabe: I'll just turn the captions on.
Michael: [grabs different remote from the table] Well I will turn up the volume.
Gabe: That's for the other box.
Michael: Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
 
Oscar: [noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Kelly: You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
Oscar: You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
 
Pam: [enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
Michael: Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?
Pam: You have a gun in your desk?
 
Ryan: [in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
Andy: No what?
Ryan: What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
Andy: Yeah.
 
Michael: [Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
Dwight: Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
Pam: Maybe I should go.
Dwight: [continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
 
Daryl: [to Andy] Take a shot.
Andy: Oh thanks.
Daryl: Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff.
Andy: Why does Erin like Gabe?
Daryl: Andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters... I'd choose you.
Andy: That's really nice, thank you.
Daryl: And I'd blow your mind.
Andy: [pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass]
 
Jim: [changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
Oscar: Jim what are you doing?
Jim: Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
Oscar: Flip it back please.
Jim: Okay... [changes back to Glee]
Kelly: The show's back on, what happened?
Ryan: We're behind.
Oscar: Go to the recorded version.
Kelly: Oh my God what song was that?
Erin: I wasn't recording it.
Oscar: What?!
Kelly: [texting] What song was it?
Erin: Wait, why do you have to record it?
Oscar: This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Erin: Jim. [Jim gives her the remote]
Kelly: Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!
 
Pam: If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
Dwight: That would be nice wouldn't it?
Pam: I can't even talk about it.
Dwight: You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
Pam: I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
Dwight: Really? Oh... Then here we are.
Erin: Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
 
Andy: [enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
Phyllis: You know your perfumes!
Andy: My nanny used to wear that.
 
Andy: I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
 
Erin: Look who I found! [points to Michael]
Michael: Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
Gabe: Let's go ahead and wash our hands.
Michael: Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
Gabe: Yep! Waste not right?
Michael: So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se.
Erin: Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
Michael: Well...
Erin: Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Michael: He's the longest baby in this room.
Erin: What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
Gabe: Erin you don't have to...
Michael: You know what Erin you do have to.
Gabe: Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
Michael: [grimacing] That's what she said. [leaves]
 
Jim: [whispering] Hey.
Pam: It's a miracle. She loves him.
Jim: I don't know about, love...
Dwight: She loves me.
Angela: [whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
Dwight: Well something's come up, I have to go.
Pam: No no no no no! She'll wake up!
Dwight: I have something to do.
Pam: Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
Dwight: I do. But you married my worst enemy.
Jim: Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
Dwight: Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Pam: Absolutely! [starts out]
Dwight: From Jim.
Jim: I don't think that's gonna...
Pam: Do it!
Jim: What kind of pizza would you like?
Dwight: Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
 
Michael: [outside opening Gabe's cable hookup box] Okay... Alright.
 
TV: And the winner is, by two votes- [TV goes blank]
Kelly: Ahhh! What's going on?!?!
 
Andy: [muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
Creed: Beleniege!
Andy: What does this say?
Creed: HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow!
Andy: [confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin's in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady...
Erin: [concerned] Are you having a good time?
Andy: Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
Erin: Andy you look awful!
Andy: You're four seasons in a day. [heaves] You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue... [stops, is struggling] It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
Erin: Are you alright?
Andy: No! [runs off]
 
Dwight: [referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
Jim: That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
Dwight: No, try me.
Pam: Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
Dwight: I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Jim: Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth]
Dwight: No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
Pam: What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
Dwight: I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
Jim: You need to stop talking.
Dwight: Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
Pam: Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
Dwight: Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
Jim: [unbelievingly] Okay...
Dwight: You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
Jim: I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
Pam: No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
Dwight: She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
Pam: The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves]
Dwight: [to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
Jim: I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
Dwight: What are you doing?
Kevin: [getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
 
Andy: [throws up on bed] Puts pillow in front of the puke.
Phyllis: Are you alright?
Andy: Erin likes Gabe.
Phyllis: I know. I thought you two were nice together.
Andy: Do you think that they've ever...
Phyllis: Made love? I don't know.
Andy: Well girls tell each other things right?
Phyllis: I'll see what I can find out.
 
Daryl: [Michael walks into disarray of people's reactions to the TV going out] Where you been?
Michael: I just went out for a walk.
Daryl: Cable's out.
Michael: What? Really? That stinks!
Gabe: It's still on upstairs.
Michael: What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
Creed: [receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
Michael: Are you kidding me?
Creed: No.
Michael: Now that's going on?
Kevin: I can't believe we're missing that!
Michael: Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot. [hurries out]
Kevin: Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!
Kelly: Good luck Michael!
 
Phyllis: Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
Erin: Oh, uhm, like three months.
Phyllis: And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
Erin: I don't know.
Phyllis: Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
Erin: [awkwardly] I have to go Phyllis.
Phyllis: Magical...
 
Pam: [knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
Angela: What are you doing here?
Pam: I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
Angela: Are you authorized to do this?
Pam: Yes! I have been so authorized.
Angela: Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
Pam: Okay.
Angela: Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
Pam: You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
Angela: You know what Pam just save it.
 
Erin: [Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
Michael: No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
Erin: Why don't you like him?
Michael: What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
Erin: I care if you like him.
Michael: Why? I'm not your father. [Erin looks sad] All right.
Erin: Okay...
Michael: Go to your room.
Erin: What? [confused]
Michael: Go to your room young lady!
Erin: [slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
Michael: You listen to me. You listen good. You are are not, to see that boy, anymore.
Erin: You listen to me. You are not to tell me what to do.
Michael: As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
Erin: I hate your roof!
Michael: Oh do not raise your voice to me!
Erin: I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
Michael: Gahh, I will pull this car over!
Erin: I hate it! I hate your car!
 
Gabe: See ya Oscar! [Oscar leaves]
Michael: [enters, looks to Gabe] If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family. 
 
Michael: Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray.
 
Gabe: [Andy is leaning over toilet] What happened?
Andy: I accidentally ate some seahorses.
Gabe: How much?
Andy: I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know.
Gabe: I've got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]
Andy: That's so beautiful.

Dwight: [lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation. 
Michael: [as the power and lights come back on] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
Jim: Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
Michael: Uh... try "password".
Jim: Nope.
Dwight: Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
Jim: No.
Dwight: Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
Jim: Okay, I'm not doing every number. 
Pam: Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up? 
Michael: Uh... it was like eight years ago?
Pam: Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
Erin: Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.
Jim: Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
Michael: Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been... Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
Andy: I got it, try, um--[Coughs]
Michael: You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
Kevin: Big Boobs. 
Meridith: Drama Queen? 
Angela: Nosy?
Pam: You're typing "Big Boobs"? 
Jim: I'm trying everything.
Dwight: Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z".
Jim: That's-- [ding] the password. We're in.
Dwight: All Right
Kevin: Wow.
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
 
Michael: Morning.
Ryan: How's It Going?
 
Ryan: Hey, I'm WUPHF. 
Michael: [wearing Ryan's glasses] I'm Facebook.
Ryan: What's up Facebook?
Michael: I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back. 
Ryan: You should've sent me a WUPHF.
Michael: A what? 
Ryan: [pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
Robotic Voice: WUPHF.
Ryan and Michael: WUPHF! 
Michael: Dot com!
 
Ryan: [getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
Erin: Sure.
Erin: Pam.
Pam: Mm-Hmm?
Erin: I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
Pam: Okay.
Erin: Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
Pam: Oh, it's okay.
Erin: But it's not for--
Pam: Let it go.
 
Pam: Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set. 
 
Michael: I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience. 
Ryan: I love it. 
Michael: I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop. 
Ryan: Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
Michael: Your kidding?! 
Ryan: We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
Michael: You and me.
Ryan: New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
Michael: Don't you work here full-time?
Ryan: [chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
Michael: Mm-Hmm.
Ryan: Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
Michael: That does sound fun to me. 
Ryan: Awesome. 
 
Dwight: [out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
Dwight: Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.
 
Dwight: Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay. 
Guy: Don't forget to make a broom.
Dwight: Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
Angela: Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
Dwight: Roll in the hay, five dollars. 
Angela: No, I meant... [motions you and me]
Dwight: Oh, our contract.
Angela: Mm-Hmm.
Dwight: Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil. 
Angela: Perfect!
Dwight: So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales. 
 
Jim: [on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
 
Jim: I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
 
Kevin: Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
Jim: Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev. 
Kevin: I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right. 
Angela: You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero. 
Jim: What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
Angela: It's a new corporate policy. 
Kevin: Dunh-duh-na-dah!
 
Gabe: Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love? 
Jim: A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
Gabe: When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean? 
Jim: Nope.
Gabe: Nudity makes me uncomfortable.
Jim: Okay. 
Gabe: My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just--[put's his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room. 
 
Michael: Excuse me, everyone... SEX! Now that I have your attention... 
Stanley: You don't have our attention. 
Michael: MONEY! 
Stanley: I'm listening.
Kevin: You had me at "Sex."
Michael: Pervert.
Phyllis: You have all of our attention just by screaming anything. 
Michael: That's good to know. [screams]
Pam: What do you want to say, Michael?
Michael: Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
Ryan: How's everybody doing?!
Michael: Whoo!
Ryan: Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
 
Stanley: Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space. 
 
Ryan: For my current investors, things are going great. 
Michael: We already have a buyer. 
Pam: Really?! Who?!
Ryan: Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions. 
Michael: At least. 
Ryan: So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family. 
Phyliss: Oh, God. Hold on to your wallets, ladies. 
 
Oscar: Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
Ryan: No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun. 
Michael: That's right!
Ryan: Fun, communication, connection. 
Oscar: What's your money situation?
Ryan: Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.
Oscar: Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
Ryan: We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming. 
Andy: I'm sorry, nine days until what?
Oscar: Bankruptcy?
Michael: Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
Oscar: How long do you think a week is?
Michael: No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
 
Jim: Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now? 
 
Jim: Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything. 
Pam: Did you prank Dwight?
Jim: No. 
Pam: Well, you like that.
Jim: Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
Pam: I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
Jim: [blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
 
Pam: Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Ryan: [colorful poster with numbers] Check this out. 
Erin: All that color. 
Michael: Look at that. Triple your investment by January. 
Andy: Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
Ryan: Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend. 
Michael: There you go.
Andy: You have his email?
Ryan: A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over. 
Stanley: I want my money back. 
Michael: Do not talk like that, Stanley.
Pam: Ryan, just tell us your plan.
Ryan: Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back. 
 
Dwight: [hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
Kids: Yeah! 
Dwight: All Right!
Kid: I wanna go on it again.
Dwight: Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
 
Dwight: Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
 
Angela: [waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
 
Angela: Where have you been?! I've been waiting. 
Dwight: Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
Angela: No, I--I think you should make time for it. 
Little Girl: I found the needle in the haystack! 
Dwight: Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
Little Girl: I don't know!
Dwight: Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
Angela: Dwight?
 
Ryan: WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach. 
Michael: Here we go. 
Ryan: Everyone's like, "Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?" Or, Uh, "Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!"
Michael: "It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!"
Ryan: "Yo, Ry from WUPHF!"
Michael: "He's up there."
Ryan: "What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!" WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky! 
Michael: Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
Daryl: Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?
Ryan: The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
Andy: That sounds weird.
Michael: No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that. 
Kelly: [walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
 
Kelly: I said to Ryan, "I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'"
Ryan: Baby, Baby, Baby--
Kelly: I think I'm gonna stay here. 
Ryan: No, no, no, no, no. 
Kelly: I do, I do. This isn't right.
Ryan: I help you with your things and you help me with my things. 
Kelly: But I--it's not right.
Ryan: [whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
Daryl: Is it any particular branch of Washington University?
Ryan: The Washington University Public Health Fund.
Daryl: W.U.P.H.F.
Pam: Oh, God!
Daryl: They only want it for the initials.
Ryan: The domain name. Yeah, they do. 
Pam: I move we sell!
Micheal: What?
Daryl: Yeah, sell!
Andy: Yeah, sell. 
Pam: Sell.
Stanley: Get us out of this!
Ryan: Have some faith in this idea!
Daryl: If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right?
Michael: I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
Ryan: Yes. You alone do, actually.
Michael: I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell. 
 
Kevin: [runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
 
Man: Do you mind if we share this bale?
Angela: Sure.
Man: There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there?
Angela: Probably.
Man: I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions?
Angela: Mm-Hmm.
Man: I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday.
Angela: Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
Man: No, no, no, I wasn't--I was just laughing at your joke.
Angela: Oh. 
Man: Pay Place.
Angela: Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
Man: That's humorous.
Angela: Thank You. 
Kevin: [stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
 
Pam: Hi, Michael.
Michael: Can't talk, saving the planet.
Pam: Oh, we don't recycle.
Michael: We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
Pam: I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
Michael: [throws the sack of garbage onto the floor] Eight Years.
Pam: Listen, I know you really like Ryan--
Michael: No, I won't even consider it.
Pam: Michael, I... [sits down] I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?
Michael: Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
Pam: Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
Michael: I think you are wrong.
Pam: And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
Michael: You may be right. I may be crazy.
Pam: Don't.
Michael: I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
Pam: Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
Michael: I thought it might make me feel better. 
Pam: Okay. Go Ahead.
Michael: [singing] But it just may be a lunatic... [stops singing] No.
 
Jim: [hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Meridith: Hey, back off. It's Solitare.
Creed: Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work.
Jim: Talk to me.
Creed: How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good.
Gabe: Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?
Creed: We're working. [Jim still holding his breath]
Gabe: Can you at least try to look busy? [Jim Exhales]
 
Jim: [listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
Jo: "The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, "You're Too Fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat." The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. "I love you, you Gay Bastard," I said. "You Gay Bastard," I s--. "Gay Ba--" "Gay B--""
 
Ryan: Michael, how's it going, bro?
Michael: Good, good, bro.
Ryan: Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
Michael: Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
Ryan: I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
Michael: Nine days, though. That's, like... 
Ryan: Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
Michael: Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
Ryan: [laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
Michael: Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
Ryan: Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
Michael: So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
Ryan: Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
Michael: Mm-Hmm. 
Ryan: Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
Michael: Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so... 
Ryan: We totally should.
Michael: Tonight?
Ryan: I gotta work on this.
Michael: Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
Ryan: Yeah. [Michael closes the door]
 
Dwight: And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]
 
Dwight: Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
 
Man: So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you?
Angela: You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
Man: My wife passed away a few years ago. 
Angela: How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
Man: Thank You.
Kevin: [still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
 
Daryl: [opens the door the Ryan's office, grabs him by the shirt, pulls him out of his chair] Consider it a WUPHF in person. [shoves Ryan down to a chair]
Andy: Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours. 
Daryl: You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell.
Andy: If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell. 
Ryan: I'm betting on myself.
Stanley: It's a bad bet.
Michael: Hello. 
Ryan: Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
Daryl: It's not that we don't believe in the company, We don't believe in you. 
Andy: All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say "aye"]
Michael: I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
Daryl: What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School?
Stanley: Michael, are you that blind?
Michael: I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. [all seem to be in agreenment] And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground. 
Andy: You're gonna lose all of our money.
Michael: Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money.
Ryan: Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
Michael: You can't have it.
Ryan: Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
 
Dwight: Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]
 
Michael: The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. [camera pans to different people in the office] Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So... [phone rings, computer chimes, etc.] That's Uh... 
Robotic Voice: WUPHF, from Ryan Howard. Decided to sell company. Thanks, bro. Hell of a ride.
Michael: Thank God. 
 
Jim: [puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
Gabe: Gabe Lewis.
Jo: [Jim's edited version of her book on tape]: Now listen here, Gabe, you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat. I made some changes to my book. See if you like them.
Gabe: Well, Jo--
Jo: Now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay bastard. Chapter One. I was born, not into luxary, nor poverty. [Gabe looks through Jo's book] But into adversity, and for that, I thank the Lord. My Father was a man. That's all we can know. After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Stree and down Azalea Lane. Which would later become my--
Jim: [opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
Jo: I've always been a fighter. And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard--

Dwight: [picks up pencil between his toes]
Jim: Why?
Dwight: Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]
Pam: Do you mind?
Dwight: I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
Pam: You don't have to do that.
Dwight: [typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
Jim: [whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
Dwight: [lifts cup up with toes]
Jim: Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
Dwight: [spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah!
Jim: Well, A for effort right?
Dwight: [taps Jim's hand with his foot]
 
Hank: Welcome, start your morning right with a burst of blueberry. Or try plain.
Andy: What's the occasion?
Hank: Dwight said this entry was a waste of space.
Andy: I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
Hank: Eight dollars.
Andy: Eight dollars?
 
Dwight: Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
 
Michael: [examines items on the reception desk] Mmhmm, China. China.
Erin: How was the dentist?
Michael: It was great. China.
Pam: Are you okay, what's wrong?
Michael: Everything here was made in China, Pam.
Andy: Yeah, its where they make stuff.
Michael: They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
Erin: Oh, no.
Michael: Yeah, right here. It is right there. [holds up magazine] Anybody read the news any more?
Dwight: China is on the move?
Michael: I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.
 
Michael: My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.
 
Darryl: Hey Andy.
Andy: Hey Darryl.
Darryl: You gotta stop texting me so much.
Andy: But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.
Darryl: You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
Andy: Got it. Then I will call you.
Darryl: No.
 
Darryl: There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. "I'm coming over baby." And I would text back "BTB", bring that booty.
 
Stanley: Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
Dwight: I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
Pam: Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
Stanley: Don't tell me how to do my business.
Dwight: Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
Jim: Which is you.
Dwight: "Which is you" is not a sentence.
Jim: I disagree with.
Stanley: Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
Pam: Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.
Dwight: Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
Pam: I'm not going to do that.
Dwight: Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
Nate: [on the phone] Y'ello.
Pam: Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.
Nate: Oh, hey Pam.
Pam: Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
Nate: Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec. 
Pam: Sure.
Dwight: [answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
Nate: Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha...
Pam: [hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
Dwight: You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]
 
Erin: Oh my God.
Michael: What?
Erin: According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
Michael: So much for keeping our secrets up high.
Erin: What's America gonna do?
Michael: I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
 
Michael: Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.
Angela: You never told us to close them.
Michael: Welcome to your future.
Phyllis: What do we do? How do we stop this?
Michael: How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?
Pam: An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
Michael: Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.
Kevin: An antacid that you only take once a week.
Michael: Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
Kevin: Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
Stanley: Why not just go one for the year?
Michael: I don't know.
Kevin: It's too big of a pill to swallow.
Michael: Alright.
Erin: What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
 
Erin: I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
 
Michael: I don't know what the [expletive] that was.
Dwight: I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
Phyllis: Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
Michael: No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
Erin: [gasps]
Oscar: Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
Kevin: Thank God.
Michael: No, no. That is right now. 
Oscar: Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
Michael: In terms of land, not population.
Oscar: Come on Michael. You can...
Michael: No, no you're wrong about this.
Oscar: Where are you getting this information?
Michael: I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
Kevin: Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?
Jim: Okay, someone look it up.
Ryan: I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.
Oscar: Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
Darryl: [reads text] "Are you watching this?" Seriously?
Andy: Well are you?
Darryl: I'm sitting right here.
Ryan: Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
Meredith: Suck it Oscar.
Jim: Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
Oscar: Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
 
Michael: So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don't care.
 
Michael: Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar? 
 
Meredith: Wow, so this building can get uglier.
Stanley: I will not work in a roach billboard.
Gabe: Oh my God, I can't look at roaches.
Angela: Michael do something about this.
Michael: Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
Pam: Dwight take it down.
Dwight: [chuckles]
Pam: I'm serious, take it down or else.
Dwight: Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
Pam: We can move out.
 
Angela: [lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
 
Pam: So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?
Jim: Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
Pam: I went out to look for a better office space.
Dwight: Waste of time.
Pam: Not really, because I found one.
Jim: Oh wow, these are nice.
Pam: Yup.
Dwight: Let me see.
Pam: Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
Jim: Yeah, yeah. Totally.
Dwight: You can't just move out.
Pam: Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
Andy: [without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
Pam: They're not of Cece.
Andy: Oh, cool.
Pam: This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Phyllis: Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
Pam: Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
Stanley: Are you trying to kill me?
Kelly: Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
Pam: Koreans.
Kelly: Good. And the dry cleaners?
Pam: White.
Kelly: Good.
 
Jim: Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
Oscar: Funny Jim. That is funny.
Michael: Very comedically humorous Jim.
Kelly: I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
Oscar: What is it?
Kelly: Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
Oscar: Alright. Alright I get it.
Kelly: Michael, how do I create a new tab?
Michael: Try 'Control P'.
Oscar: That's print.
Michael: Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
Kelly: Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
Oscar: He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
Kelly: Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
Ryan: Actually, it was.
 
Jim: Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
 
Darryl: [reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
Andy: Megan Fox! Come on!
Darryl: You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
Andy: Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
Darryl: You accept these terms?
Andy: Oh, its on.
 
Dwight: In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
Kevin: Well, I wish for a million wishes.
Dwight: Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
Kevin: Then see you later building.
Dwight: You can't possibly be serious.
Kevin: I said see you later building.
Oscar: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey.
Oscar: I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
Michael: Mmm.
Oscar: I'd love to talk more about it.
Michael: Yeah.
Oscar: Maybe over some coffee later?
Michael: Sure.
Jim: Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
Michael: Coffee Jim.
Jim: No.
Andy: It is not just coffee.
Jim: He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
Michael: Yes.
Andy: And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
Michael: Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.
Jim: No politics?
Michael: I'm pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California." [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?
 
Dwight: Parley, my office, five minutes.
Pam: Parley?
Creed: Pirate code, he wants to meet.
Pam: So everyone here knows pirate code?
Creed: I understand it, I can't speak it.
 
Dwight: Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
Pam: You've been watering down the soap?
Dwight: Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
Pam: We need everything back the way it was.
Dwight: You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous... for stripping.
Pam: That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]
 
Ryan: Where is Tibet?
Michael: Pass.
Ryan: When was China founded?
Michael: Pass.
Jim: Two for two, keep it up.
Ryan: Who is Mao?
Michael: Lifeline.
Andy: Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
Michael: I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
Jim: What do you know about boobs? 
Andy: Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.
Jim: Thank you.
Andy: This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
Michael: Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
Andy: I'm like a quarter of the way through.
Michael: Is it going to be worth it?
Andy: No.
Ryan: Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
Michael: I don't need to cheat.
Jim: Show him how to use it.
 
Nate: [riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six.
Dwight: Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
Nate: Yeah.
Dwight: There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
Nate: The building's underground?
Dwight: She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...
Dwight & Nate: Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam.
Passer-by: Yeah?
Nate: Pam. Pam?
Dwight: What?
Passer-by: I'm Pam.
Dwight: Oh.
Nate: No you're not.
Dwight: I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
Passer-by: Oh, that's fine.
Dwight: So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
Passer-by: I've been known to bend the truth.
Dwight: Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
Passer-by: Okay.
Dwight: I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
 
Dwight: Hey Pam.
Pam : Yeah?
Dwight: Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
Pam: I know, because you're the reason we're moving.
Dwight: Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
Pam: Uhh, I think it's something like umm...
Dwight: What's the exact square footage.
Pam: Umm, let me see.
Dwight: How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
Pam: Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.
Dwight: [chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say "Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is." I can't wait.
Pam: Mmhmm.
 
Pam: I lied about some aspects of the building.
Jim: It's still on a bike path though right?
Pam: There's no building... it doesn't exist.
Jim: What does that mean?
Pam: I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...
Jim: What?
Pam: Fail. I don't want to fail... again.
Jim: But you didn't fail.
Pam: And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.
Jim: And you didn't fail those things either.
Pam: Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?
Jim: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
 
Oscar: Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
Michael: Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
Oscar: We have missiles too.
Michael: Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
 
Nate: I wasn't here. [places a book in front of Pam]
Pam: What?
Nate: I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
Pam: Well thanks.
Nate: Yeah.
 
Michael: China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
Oscar: Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
Michael: How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
Oscar: Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
Michael: Don't... I...
 
Pam: Hello, hello. You're breaking the law.
Dwight: Impossible, I love the law.
Pam: Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper. 
Dwight: I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Nate: I don't think it goes that way.
Dwight: Reply it!
 
Oscar: Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Michael: Yeah, I figured that.
Oscar: Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
Michael: Wait. You forgetting something?
Oscar: What?
Michael: This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
Erin: Fire him. No, show mercy.
Michael: Here we are.
Oscar: What's your point.
Michael: My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.
Andy: Yeah. [clapping]
Erin: Right, yes.
Michael: I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
Oscar: That's not.
Michael: Raise your cups on high. Case closed. 
Oscar: That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
 
Dwight: They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
 
Darryl: [reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
 
Andy: Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone]
Darryl: [laughs] That's a text. [high fives Andy]
Andy: Yeah. Right.
Darryl: That's your new standard.

Nate: Got it. [taking a group photo outside]
Pam: Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.
Michael: People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one.
Jim: One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
Pam: Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.
Kevin: Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
Andy: Let's just jump in the air!
Michael: That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
Pam: Okay.
Nate: One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.
Michael: Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
Nate: One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping.
Jim: You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
Dwight: I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
Phyllis: I am jumping.
Dwight: You are? 
Phyllis: Yes, I'm jumping.
Dwight: Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
Pam: I'm freezing.
Nate: Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'.
Erin: I didn't want to miss it.
Andy: Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.
Oscar: Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
Michael: Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?
Oscar: Why?
Michael: I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
Nate: Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]
Michael: We didn't get it.
 
Pam: I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
 
Pam: It hardly looks fake. It's so lush.
Jim: Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
 
Michael: Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! [dressed as Santa]
All: Merry Christmas.
Michael: How's everybody doing today?
Erin: Good.
Michael: How's the party coming along?
Pam: Great.
Michael: Are we over budget?
Pam: Nope.
Michael: No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
Meredith: Not yet!
Michael: Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?
Angela: Nothing. Should be fun.
Michael: So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
Stanley: [cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
Michael: Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
Andy: Yea?
Michael: Whatcha got?
Andy: All good, Santa.
Michael: Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
 
Michael: My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.
 
Kelly: It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
Gabe: We just want to say how grateful we are.
 
Kelly: Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, "Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do."
 
Kelly: It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
Andy: Hello Kitty's for girls.
Pam: Nashua got mp3 players.
Phyllis: Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.
Kelly: I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
Meredith: Wow.
Phyllis: Oh God.
Dwight: Oh come on.
Kelly: I said, "I wonder." I didn't say, "I think."
Gabe: Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
Kelly: Blankets, what am I, five?
Gabe: Erin and I make great use of ours.
 
Gabe: Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?
 
Darryl: I'll take one of those pink pouches.
 
Darryl: I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
 
Jim: Hey, it's snowing.
Dwight: [mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
Jim: [Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
Dwight: Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
Jim: Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
Dwight: Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Phyllis: Oh, don't be such a baby.
Stanley: Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
Dwight: You apologize to me right now.
Jim: You've got something on your nose.
Dwight: You apologize right now.
Jim: No.
Dwight: Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
Jim: You got it.
Andy: That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
Dwight: No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.
 
Kevin: Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Angela: I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
Oscar: State senator.
Angela: I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
Oscar: Who are you dating in the public arena?
Angela: The senator.
Kevin: Oh, right. The state senator.
Angela: We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
Kevin: Oh, that would be impressive... if anyone knew what a comptroller was.
Oscar: Well...
 
Angela: Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. "Angela..." [imitates camera shooting] "over here, Angela..." [imitates camera shooting] "here. Look here!"
 
Pam: Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
Michael: Yeah!
Pam: A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
Michael: Pam? Pam?
Dwight: Pam?
Pam: Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
Toby: Hi guys.
Michael: Hi.
Toby: Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
Michael: Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
Toby: Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
Michael: Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
Dwight: Death to Toby!
Toby: Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements.
Michael: You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
Phyllis: What's the case, Toby?
Toby: Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.
Andy: Is it criminal?
Toby: Yes.
Andy: Have we heard of it?
Toby: I don't know.
Dwight: Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Toby: Come on.
Meredith: Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
Toby: Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck]
Ryan: He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
Kelly: He's rubbing his neck.
Ryan: He's rubbing his neck.
Andy: Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react]
Toby: I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts]
Michael: That was the worst joke ever.
Toby: Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
Michael: Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.
Toby: Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
Michael: What? What?
Toby: Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
Michael: Hold on, Holly's coming back here?
Toby: Yeah.
Erin: Guys, who's Holly?
Michael: That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
Erin: Wow.
Creed: She's one sassy black lady.
Michael: Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
Gabe: I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
Michael: You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
Dwight: Okay.
Michael: Cancel. We're canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food]
Angela: No, don't throw those out!
Michael: No, we have to cancel the party.
Angela: We can save that.
Michael: No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
Andy: I bought these.
Michael: I know.
Andy: These cookies are fine.
Michael: It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
Pam: Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.
Michael: Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.
Pam: I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.
Michael: You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
 
Michael: Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away.
 
Michael: We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. [imitating Sean Connery] The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow! [camera pans down to Angela pinning Michael's pants]
Angela: Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
Michael: Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.
Angela: Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
Michael: Okay. Sure.
Angela: I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
Michael: You never know about the press.
Angela: Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
Michael: Could he help us with some parking tickets?
Angela: I don't think that's appropriate.
Michael: Well, then he's not a senator.
Angela: Yes, he is.
Michael: Okay.
 
Jim: Hey.
Pam: Hey.
Jim: We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Pam: Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
Jim: Me neither. Whew.
Pam: Okay.
 
Pam: I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.
 
Jim: [A note is on Jim's computer that says, "It is time. Parking lot at noon." Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
 
Michael: Okay... [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!
Pam: No, it has the little...
Michael: Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.
Bass Player: Hi, I'm looking for Michael Scott.
Michael: Yes, that's me. Come on it.
 
Michael: [scats awkwardly] There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
 
Pam: Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
Kevin: I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Pam: Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
Andy: I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
Kevin: Yeah.
Andy: I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
Pam: Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.
Andy: You know Darryl?
Pam: Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Andy: I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.
Pam: Cool.
Darryl: Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine. 
Justine: [on the phone] I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here.
Darryl: She did?
Justine: Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas.
 
Darryl: I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
 
Darryl: [Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
Andy: It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.
Pam: Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.
Darryl: Uh, no.
Andy: Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
Darryl: No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
Pam: Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.
Darryl: Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
 
Michael: When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
Erin: I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
Michael: She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.
Erin: Oh...
Toby: Hey.
Michael: What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.
Toby: Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
Kevin: Hi, Toby.
 
Meredith: What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
Kevin: Yeah.
Meredith: That scowl.
Toby: I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
Michael: And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
 
Toby: I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.
 
Jim: [standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone]
Dwight: [voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
Dwight: Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Jim: Stop! Stop!
Dwight: Ahh!
Jim: Oh... oh!
Dwight: [grunting, shouting] 
 
Dwight: I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
 
Dwight: [dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]
 
Jim: Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] "How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight." 
 
Holly: Hi.
Erin: Hello.
Holly: Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
Erin: I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
Michael: There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?
Erin: Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry.
Michael: Hello.
Holly: [weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.
Michael: [imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
Holly: Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
Michael: [as Curly] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?
Holly: [as Curly] I most certainly am.
Michael: Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
Holly: Unnnnnnngh!
Michael: [as Homer] D'oh!
Holly: [as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh]
Jim: Okay... Holly's back.
Michael: Hi. Hi. Oh... [they hug]
Holly: [in monster voice] Oh, huggy monster!
Michael: Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
Holly: Hi.
Kevin: Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
Holly: Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
Michael: That's adorable.
Holly: Would you put those out?
Erin: To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
Holly: Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
Michael: Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
Holly: Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
Michael: Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.
Holly: [in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
Michael: What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
Jim: Aww...
Holly: It's a pea shoot...
 
Michael: This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?
Holly: Yeah, kind of.
Michael: Oh...
Holly: Oh...
Michael: Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy... 
Holly: AJ gave me that.
Michael: Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
Holly: Mmhmm.
Michael: You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.
Holly: Why?
Michael: Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
Holly: That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
Michael: You're kidding me. Ahh!
Holly: No. I know. I was like, "What? Are you serious?"
Michael: What a douche bag!
Holly: Get a life!
Michael: Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
Holly: We sat down and we watched them all in one day. 
Michael: Mmhmm.
Holly: Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Michael: Good for him.
Holly: Next day I found him in my bed.
Michael: Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
Holly: We live together.
Michael: Oh, you do?
Holly: He had a little note pinned to him that said, "You've got a friend in me."
Michael: [fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
Holly: Yeah. I love him.
Michael: Me too.
 
Andy: [singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
Pam: Hey, how about this one?
Andy: Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
Pam: Maybe. I mean... 
Darryl: [on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
Pam: Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.
Andy: I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.
Darryl: Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Pam: Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
Darryl: Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
Pam: No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Darryl: How do I do that?
Pam: Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.
Andy: Yes.
Pam: You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
 
Pam: Hey guys, the tree's here.
Michael: Hey.
Andy: Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...
Oscar: Why would someone hug you?
Michael: Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.
Darryl: Are you serious?
Michael: It's a sophisticated take.
Jada: He doesn't look like Santa Claus.
Darryl: No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
Michael: Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
Pam: Who told you that?
Michael: Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
 
Phyllis: So is it an open relationship?
Holly: Oh, God, no.
Kelly: Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
Holly: Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Kelly: So where's the ring?
Pam: Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
Phyllis: Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
Pam: You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
Erin: Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
 
Erin: I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
 
Holly: Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
Pam: Wow, an ultimatum.
Holly: Yeah.
Pam: It doesn't really seem like you.
Kelly: That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
 
Dwight: [turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
Jim: Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Dwight: Oh, no. Oh, no!
Jim: Stop!
Dwight: Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
Jim: Okay. Okay. Okay.
Dwight: Huh? You like that?
Jim: Seriously!
Dwight: Huh?
Jim: Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
 
Dwight: Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
 
Jim: I just want it to stop.
 
Pam: So, cool right?
Ryan: There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
Pam: Okay.
Ryan: We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
Pam: Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
Ryan: Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
Pam: I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
Ryan: Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
Pam: No.
Ryan: Okay.
 
Toby: Oh, Jim. Hey.
Jim: Hey, Toby.
Toby: There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
Jim: No way.
Toby: Who looks exactly like you.
Jim: That's increadible.
Toby: Yeah. No, it's uncanny.
Jim: You know what's crazy?
Toby: What?
Jim: I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
 
Michael: I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly's Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]
 
Angela: It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
Meredith: Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
Gabe: Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
 
Holly: You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
Michael: What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
Dwight: I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
Jim: What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
Dwight: With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
Holly: Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
Michael: All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
Dwight: Wait, what girlfriend?
Michael: I haven't told you about her.
Dwight: I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
Michael: I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."
Holly: I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Michael: I do. She is.
 
Michael: Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.
 
Phyllis: So you went homemade this year.
Pam: Yup.
Phyllis: Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
Pam: No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
Phyllis: Are you good at homemade?
Pam: Look at this.
Phyllis: Yeah...
 
Holly: [walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
Phyllis: Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
Erin: That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
Michael: What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.
Toby: No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
Michael: Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.
Kevin: Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
Michael: It is Christmas.
Angela: No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
Michael: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
Andy: Why would anyone frame you for that?
Jim: Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly?
Michael: Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
Holly: You think this is funny?
Michael: [laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
Jim: Yikes. [everyone gasps]
Kevin: Oh no, that's, that's not happening.
Dwight: Dear God in heaven.
Michael: All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
Holly: Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
Michael: Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.
Dwight: Okay, hey, hey, hey...
Jim: No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
Holly: You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
Michael: When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
Holly: Michael, I'm sorry.
Michael: And we did this whole stupid party for you.
Erin: [blocks Holly's path] No.
Holly: You guys, it wasn't my fault.
Kevin: Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
 
Erin: I really think you're better off.
Michael: Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
Erin: Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
 
Jim: [walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] "Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese." [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
Dwight: Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
 
Stanley: So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
Toby: No, they bring it in.
Stanley: You lucky son of a bitch.
 
Stanley: I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
 
Jada: Daddy, I'm bored. Can I read my book in your office?
Darryl: Sure, sweetie.
 
Pam: Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
 
Pam: Oh, my goodness.
Andy: I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
Darryl: Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
Jada: What kind of challenges.
Andy: Wahhh...
Pam: Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?
Andy: No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
Jada: I don't know.
Andy: Do you know the other state?
Darryl: Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
Andy: The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear]
Darryl: And the game's over seconds later.
 
Angela: I'm so glad you could come.
Robert: It's nice. I know.
Angela: Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
Robert: Hi.
Oscar: Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
Robert: Oscar. A pleasure.
 
Oscar: Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
 
AJ: Hi.
Erin: Hello.
AJ: I'm, uh, I'm AJ. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise.
Erin: I know who you are, and I think you should go.
Kevin: I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
AJ: Was I supposed to bring you guys something?
Holly: What? AJ!
AJ: Surprise.
Holly: What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
AJ: I wanted to see you. How are you?
Holly: Wow! Nice.
AJ: Oh, God, you look great.
Holly: Oh... when did you get here?
AJ: Just now.
Michael: Hey
AJ: Just now. Hey, Michael.
Michael: Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.
AJ: Pleased to see you. Thank you.
Michael: Good trip down?
AJ: Yeah, it was great.
Michael: Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.
 
Michael: I am dead inside.
 
Darryl: What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies... 
Jada: You have a whole room of vending machines?
Creed: [chuckles] I know. Isn't it something?
Jada: I can't decide what I want.
 
Darrly: [handing out vending machine items to everyone] Merry Christmas.
Jada: Merry Christmas.
Pam: Thank you.
Jada: And Merry Christmas.
Meredith: Thank you.
Jada: And Merry Christ... mas.
 
Robert: Thank you so much.
Jada: Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas.
Oscar: Merry Christmas to you.
 
Jada: Merry Christmas.
Bass Player: Oh, thank you.
 
Kevin: [Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
 
Ryan: [holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
 
Creed: [Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me?
Angela: Yes.
Creed: Thank you very much.
Angela: Mmhmm.
 
Angela: I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
Kevin: Wow, that's awesome!
Oscar: A real David and Goliath story.
Robert: I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work.
Angela: I am.
Meredith: The real problem is the teachers' union.
Angela: Zip it, Meredith.
Meredith: No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
Ryan: Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Angela: You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
Oscar: I'll make it. What are you drinking.
Ryan: An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
Oscar: I don't know how to make that.
Ryan: Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
Angela: And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
Meredith: Annoying.
Angela: Yes.
 
Pam: [Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
Jim: Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
Pam: Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it]
Jim: Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
Pam: [lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.
Jim: You like it?
Pam: I love it.
 
Jim: Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
 
Jim: Alright, my turn.
Pam: Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.
Jim: Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] "The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert." Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
 
Jim: I mean... [speechless]
 
Pam: Michael, wait!
Michael: Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.
Pam: That's good advice.
Michael: Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
Pam: That's a sad story.
Michael: [voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.
Pam: Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay. 
Michael: No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
Pam: I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
Michael: Really?
Pam: Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
Michael: No.
Pam: So just be patient.
Michael: Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.
 
Jim: I surrender.
Dwight: I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
Jim: Anything. You got it.
Dwight: You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
Jim: You're a psychopath.
Dwight: I'll take that as a no.
 
Michael: I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.
Kelly: Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
Michael: No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
Kelly: Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
Michael: [hands Kelly a receipt from his wallet] From the mall. That...
Kelly: This is a fast food receipt from April.
Michael: Well, that... 
Kelly: God, how many number nines did you order?
AJ: Is everyone here kind of mean?
Holly: Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
AJ: Oh. 
Holly: Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
AJ: Hey, what happened to Woody?
Holly: Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
AJ: He smells awful.
Holly: It was blue cheese dressing.
AJ: Great.
 
Darryl: Hey, Mike.
Michael: Hey.
Darryl: We wanted to give you something.
Michael: Oh.
Jada: Merry Christmas.
Michael: Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
Darryl: What do you say?
Jada: You're welcome.
Michael: Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?
Jada: Yeah.
Michael: I think I know where he is.
 
Jada: A trampoline...
Michael: Mmhmm.
Jada: Video games.
Michael: Video games.
Jada: A DSi.
Michael: A DSi?
Jada: A horse.
Michael: A horse.
Jada: A pool.
Michael: You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?
Jada: Yes.
Michael: All right. You have to pick up after them.
 
Pam: Hey, sorry. I'm ready.
Jim: I don't want to go.
Pam: Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]
Jim: Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
Pam: I'm sorry. I had no idea.
Jim: No, it's, it's okay. Okay.
Pam: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
Jim: Okay. This is it.
Pam: What?
Jim: Go! Go! Go!
Pam: What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!
 
Dwight: In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.

Man: Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting.
Dwight: Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Jim: Oh.
Dwight: This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
 
Dwight: Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
 
Jim: I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
Dwight: No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
Man: Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence.
Dwight: What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.
Jim: I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
Dwight: Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
Jim: Sounds good.
Dwight: Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them. 
Jim: Smart.
Dwight: And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.
Man: Go ahead and read it, some people weren't here.
Dwight: Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
Jim: Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
Member: It was pretty cool.
Jim: Was it?
Member: It was fun. 
Dwight: It was pretty awesome.
Jim: [answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now. 
 
Michael: January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this.
 
Michael: Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
 
Michael: [filming video] Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not.
Erin: [giggles] Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot. I am so sorry.
Michael: Okay, so killing yourself. [laughs] I was just thinking about snot.
 
Angela: Good morning.
Pam: Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
Dwight: Wow. Did your baby draw that? 
Angela: The glitter is blinding.
Phyllis: I think it's good.
Pam: It's gonna be fun.
 
Pam: I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome. 
 
Phyllis: I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right? 
 
Erin: Okay, champagne.
Michael: Happy.
Erin: Sponge.
Michael: Sad. To soak up my tears.
Erin: Gummi bears and gummi worms.
Michael: Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
Erin: Ukulele's happy?
Michael: Sad, something to break.
Erin: Chocolates.
Michael: For you, job well done.
Erin: Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
Michael: Both sad. 
Erin: And did you get the tickets?
Michael: I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael.
 
Erin: I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
 
Pam: Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year's resolution board. 
Michael: Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
Kelly: What happened? Is there a ring?
Michael: So... high five me. We're back. To a happy... [grabs Holly's hand] look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
Kelly: [whispering] Come on!
Holly: They're warm.
Michael: They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
Dwight: Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
Michael: Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
Kevin: [Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
Kelly: Wow. 
Michael: Oh my God! That's it! That's it! 
Holly: Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
Kelly: Yes, I told everyone. 
Holly: [sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha! 
Kevin: Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
 
Michael: Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!
Video Michael: Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, calm down, breathe. 
Michael: I'm trying!
Video Michael: I said breathe!
Michael: I'm trying! 
Video Michael: Wait a second, are you listening to music?
Michael: What?
Video Michael: Shut that off! 
Michael: I'm not listening to music!
Video Michael: Fine, just go crazy for a little while! Lookin' good! You're lookin' good. [roping Michael in] Oh, I gotcha! I gotcha! I'm pulling you back! Michael dance off!
Michael: Go! Oh, that's nice.
Video Michael: Go!
Michael: Me? Okay.
Erin: Go! 
Video Michael: Nice! We're gonna calm down later.
Michael: I'm good. 
Erin: Oh, yeah!
Michael: Oh my God! [sprays champagne on Erin] 
 
Pam: Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards.
Dwight: Not doing that.
Pam: Why not?
Dwight: I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
Andy: Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine.
Pam: Learn to cook for one!
Andy: Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so... two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one. 
Pam: Well, maybe you'll meet someone.
Andy: No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad. 
Pam: Angela.
Angela: Yes.
Pam: Make time for romance!
Oscar: Who's the senator?
Angela: My boyfriend.
Oscar: Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
Angela: Ugh.
Dwight: Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
Angela: Oh, God.
Andy: That's a good one.
Dwight: Yeah.
Andy: You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.
Dwight: Awesome.
Darryl: You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...' 
Andy: The bookstore? 
Dwight: It's that easy?
Darryl: I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
Dwight: Okay, I'll drive.
 
Darryl: My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
 
Michael: Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone! 
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: That is neat. 
Holly: I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
Michael: [imitating E.T.] E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
Holly: [imitating E.T.] Holly misses old phone.
Michael: [imitating E.T.] Why?
Holly: [imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception. 
Michael: [imitating E.T.] Bummer.
Holly: [imitating E.T.] Bummer.
Michael: [imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces.
Holly: [imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces?
Kelly: Oh, God, please stop!
Michael: I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible. [slams phone on desk, phone breaks]
Holly: [reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
 
Michael: Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ?
Pam: I don't think so.
Michael: When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
Pam: No.
Michael: But you did still love him.
Pam: I'm not... I'm not going to have...
Michael: Do you love him now?
Pam: No! Just talk to her.
Michael: No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. [disgusted voice] Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
Phyllis: I'll talk to her, Michael.
Michael: You think she'd talk to you?
Phyllis: Why wouldn't she?
Michael: That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?
Pam: There's a plan.
 
Andy: All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
Dwight: I'll take the entirety of the second floor. 
Darryl: I got that cutie behind the counter.
 
Bookstore employee: Well, if you read a lot, you should check out our e-readers. They're really neat.
Darryl: Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Bookstore employee: Actually, it's ten thousand.
Darryl: Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
 
Andy: Hi.
Customer: Hi.
Dwight: Welcome.
Andy: Let us know if you need anything.
Customer: Thanks.
Andy: Why did we pretend like we work here?
Dwight: Is that what we were doing? 
Darryl: Hey, how'd you do?
Andy: Good!
Dwight: Good. Real good.
Darryl: Really?
Dwight: Yeah, yeah! 
Andy: We kinda nailed it.
Dwight: Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
Darryl: Cool.
Dwight: Okay. What'd you get?
Darryl: A book about oceans.
Dwight: Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
Darryl: No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
 
Phyllis: [whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Erin: Want some company?
Holly: Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
Phyllis: Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
Erin: I went to Portugal.
Holly: Oh, wow... you went together?
Phyllis: No.
Erin: No.
Phyllis: So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
Holly: Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
Phyllis: You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
Holly: It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
 
Darryl: Whoa! Hold on.
Dwight: I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Darryl: [Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh. 
Dwight: Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
Darryl: I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
Dwight: Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
Andy: Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink.
Darryl: What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
Andy: I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties. 
Dwight: Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
Andy: Roller derby practice!
Darryl: We're going skating.
 
Pam: The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
Erin: Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
Pam: Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee]
Gabe: Intercepted!
Erin: Hey! Gabe.
Gabe: Whoops.
Pam: Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
Creed: I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
Pam: How is it going?
Creed: I'm having a little trouble motivating. 
Pam: One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February. 
Michael: Or sooner.
Pam: Yeah. 
Michael: That's not a joke.
Pam: But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?
Kevin: Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
Pam: Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
Michael: Is it?
Pam: Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
Michael: Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
Kevin: Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
Michael: What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
Creed: Well, I can't, I don't know how.
Michael: You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser.
Creed: My tombstone's already made, thank you.
Michael: Just do a cartwheel!
Erin: This is all I could find.
Michael: [holding broccoli in front of Kevin] Eat it.
Pam: You don't have to do that, Kevin.
Kevin: I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
Kelly: Why are you eating stem first?
Kevin: This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
Ryan: The other way.
Kevin: Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
Michael: No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
Pam: Oh, Michael. 
Michael: Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
Kevin: God, I hate it.
Michael: I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it! 
Angela: All right!
Michael: Eat it!
Kelly: You're killing him, Michael!
Michael: All right, all right, shh!
Kevin: All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
Michael: Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. [reveals hidden broccoli, spits it out] Oh, God! You guys are pathetic. 
Kevin: Can I get some candy, or something?
Michael: No! You can't have any candy!
Oscar: I'll get him water. 
Pam: Okay, Michael, just settle down. 
 
Michael: [imitating E.T.] Holly Flax.
Holly: Yes, Michael?
Michael: [imitating E.T.] Not Michael, E.T.
Holly: What's up?
Michael: Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there. 
Holly: Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
 
Michael: Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
Creed: You think?
Michael: And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax. 
Kevin: You were super mean.
Michael: It was insensitive and I am sorry.
Kevin: It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
Michael: I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line. 
Kevin: Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life. 
Michael: You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends. 
Creed: I don't think I'm there yet, Boss.
Kevin: Well, I am. [hugs Michael]
Michael: Okay, oh! All right.
Kevin: I'm going to help you.
Michael: Okay.
 
DJ: [at the skating rink]Hey, uh. It's just you. Anything you want to hear?
Andy: Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
DJ: Okay. [Ants Go Marching starts playing]
Andy: I said no hits!
 
Ryan: I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
Kevin: Hey, Ryan.
Ryan: Yeah.
Kevin: How's your fart project coming?
Ryan: That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
Kevin: Me.
Pam: Kevin, don't! Come on!
Kelly: Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!
Pam: Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
Meredith: [holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em... 
Kelly: Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
Ryan: Okay, no.
 
Kelly: My resolution was to get more attention.
 
Ryan: No, she's lying.
Kevin: Hey, Ryan. [taps board, makes farting noise]
Erin: One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
Creed: [bleep] you! [bleep] you! God!
Pam: Okay, that's it. 
 
Pam: [throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.
 
Darryl: Sup?
Andy: Hey! Where did you go?
Darryl: To the arcade.
Andy: Oh, cool.
Darryl: Why, did you meet someone?
Andy: Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
Darryl: Right on, son.
Dwight: Gentlemen.
Andy: And where did you go?
Dwight: Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
Darryl: Right.
DJ: So, that's it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe.
Dwight: Yeah!
 
Erin: You want to keep this?
Michael: No.
Erin: Do you want to keep this?
Michael: Yup.
Erin: Do you want to keep this?
Michael: You can toss them.
 
Michael: My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully. 
 
Holly: We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
 
Holly: I just think we need to cool things down for awhile. Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
 
Michael: Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
Creed: Mmmhm.
Michael: You ready to do this?
Creed: Yes, sir.
Michael: You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
Creed: I really appreciate it, Boss.
Michael: It's about you. It's about you. Go!
Creed: I did it!
Michael: You did?
Creed: The perfect cartwheel.
Michael: Okay.
Creed: What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.
Michael: Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow. 

David Brent: Oh, sorry, mate. 
Michael: [English accent] Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate. 
David: [laughing] What you doing?
Michael: English? 
David: You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that. 
Michael: Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
David: Yeah big time, yeah. 
Michael: I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah. 
David: Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
Michael: Michael Scott. 
David: Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li [bleep]. That's what it sounds like. 
Michael: [laughing] 
David: Herrow! Herrow!
Michael: I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping! 
David: You can't do that these days. You can't. 
Michael: No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality. 
David: No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh. 
Michael: That's good. Pleasure to meet you. 
David: Where are you working?
Michael: Dunder Mifflin. 
David: Any jobs now? 
Michael: No, not right now. 
David: Just let me know. 
Michael: All right. See you around. 
David: All right. 
Michael: Bye-bye. What a nice guy. 
 
Erin: Your first student is here, Mister Bernard. 
Andy: That's actually "Master of Ceremonies" Bernard. 
 
Andy: Last year, I went to a seminar called "The Ten Secrets of Real Estate". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients. 
 
Erin: Oh it's... [points to conference room]
Michael: [enters] [in a gruff voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar. 
Erin: Michael? 
Michael: Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos. 
Erin: Ooh. Wait, Michael?
Michael: Okay. 
 
Michael: I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character "Mikanos", is just a little added flava. "Mikanos" is loosely based on another character I do, "Spiros", who is more about the ladies. 
 
Andy: Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best. 
Jim: Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win. 
Andy: Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous. 
Jim: Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar. 
Andy: No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy, 
Jim: I know. 
Andy: If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night. 
Jim: I'm really sorry. I can't do it. 
Andy: You can't. You can't. 
 
Andy: I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at. 
 
Jim: Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over? 
Pam: What's going on? Do you know that guy?
Jim: I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office. 
Dwight: Hey. 
Jim: Hey. 
Dwight: [to Erin] How are the marks?
 
Dwight: What are some of your small business ideas?
Older guy: I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts. 
Phyllis, Stanley, Dwight: Oooh!
Dwight: That's great. There's a big, big future in that. 
Phyllis: A lot of mines in Scranton. 
Dwight: Um, what about you? 
Younger Guy: Uh, credit cards. 
Dwight: Uh-huh. 
Younger Guy: My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction.
Dwight: Wow! 
Younger Guy: Something with cell phones. It's like, every time you make a phone call I'd make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents. 
Dwight: Right. Okay? Great. 
Stanley: Great. 
 
Dwight: You promised us whales. These are worms. 
Andy: They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter. 
Stanley: I'm out. 
Andy: Stanley, you're suppose to close. 
Phyllis: I'm out too. 
Andy: What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team. 
Dwight: We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team. 
 
Michael: You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and... 
Holly: Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that. 
Michael: Okay.
 
Michael: Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it. 
 
Michael: [as Mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos? 
Holly: Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian. 
Michael: Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today. 
Holly: Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus. 
Michael: Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that. 
 
Erin: [muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is "jlp" a word? 
Pam: "Jelp?" J-e-l-p?
Erin: No, j-l-p. Like, "I jlp... I jlp you!"
Pam: I don't think that's a word. 
Erin: I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game. 
 
Erin: The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen "The Shining", "Rosemary's Baby", "The Ring". Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything. 
 
Pam: You want some help?
Erin: Really?
Pam: Mm-hmm. 
Erin: Yes. 
Pam: K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean?
Oscar: It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play "moo"?
Erin: Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing "moo", I'm playing "milk". Whatever it takes. 
Oscar: Okay, but look, you could have hit "mood". Would have played a... 
Erin: Uh... 
Oscar: A triple word. 
Erin: Like the cow mood yesterday. God. 
Oscar: Or moon. 
Erin: The cow jumped over the moon. 
Oscar: She's stuck on that one thing. 
Pam: No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right? 
 
Andy: Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy. 
Kevin: Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam. 
Andy: Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great. 
Kevin: Then I won't let you down. 
 
Kelly: Cake. 
Ryan: In you go. 
Andy: Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right? 
Ryan: Yup. 
Andy: I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business. 
Ryan: And?
Andy: Can you do it?
Ryan: Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that. 
Andy: So no? 
Ryan: No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment. 
Kelly: Oh, baby. 
Andy: What do I put you down for, bro hombre? 
Ryan: Yes. 
Andy: All right!
Ryan: Yes, I'll do it. 
Andy: Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome. 
Ryan: And if I flake, I flake. 
Andy: What? 
 
Andy: Kevin, you open it up. 
Kevin: Yep. 
Andy: Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
Kevin: Go. 
Creed: Creed! Ha! 
 
Andy: Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog. 
Older Woman: Hi Nard Dog. I'm Lu Peachem. 
Andy: Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, "Don't Just Dream it, do it." Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure's Crazy Train]
Kevin: [running laps around the conference room] Yes! 
 
Kevin: There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type. 
 
Kevin: [out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
Andy: Are you okay? 
Kevin: No. Yes! 
Andy: Here... 
Kevin: No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
 
Andy: I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last... 
Kelly: But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend. 
Andy: What are you... 
Kelly: Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch. 
 
Kelly: It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. "The Business Bitch", "The Diet Bitch", "The Shopping Bitch", "The Etiquette Bitch." 
 
Kelly: I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing. 
Professor Powell: Hey, Kelly Kapoor. What a delicious surprise. 
Kelly: Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone. 
Professor Powell: Uh, why? 
Kelly: Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
Professor Powell: Um, there aren't really ten secrets. 
Kelly: Come on Scott, please? It's me. 
Professor Powell: Um, all right. Well, um, I guess know your market would be key. Practice fiscal discipline. 
Kelly: Mm-hmm. 
 
Andy: That brilliant little bitch.
 
Oscar: A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that "q" right there. 
Erin: Wait. Why?
Oscar: Put the "q" there, sweetie. 
Pam: I think there's better... 
Oscar: Put the "q" there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled. 
Pam: You could have just told us what you were thinking. 
Oscar: There's no theater in that. 
Pam: There's no yelling in that, either. 
Oscar: Well... 
 
Holly: What do you do in your free time? 
Michael: [as Mikanos] Practice Olympics. 
Holly: Mmm. Do you like movies? 
Michael: [as Mikanos] I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home". 
Holly: We have to try this out on somebody. 
 
Michael: [as Mikanos] Hello. 
Hank: Look, you want to order something? 
Michael: She will have a greekaccino. 
Hank: I don't know what that is. 
Michael: It... 
Holly: [with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat. 
Michael: [laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk! 
Holly: No more brain damage. 
Michael: No more brain damage! 
Holly: Ahh! 
 
Holly: I don't know. 
 
Andy: Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton. [applause] 
Creed: Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here? 
Andy: [clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour. 
 
Gabe: I picked out our movie. It's called "Suspiria". It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down. 
Erin: When I win... 
Gabe: Ooh. 
Erin: We're gonna watch "Wall-e", where all the boundaries of color are pushed. 
 
Gabe: It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some "Slumdog Millionaire" scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible. 
 
Dwight: So what's your crazy business pipe dream? 
Guy: Well, I started my own golf supply company. 
Dwight: [unimpressed] Really? 
Guy: It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth. 
Dwight: [quietly] Phyllis?
Phyllis: Hmm?
Dwight: Some of these people are for real. 
 
Dwight: Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you. 
Andy: Thank you. 
Dwight: Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh? 
Andy: Really? 
Darryl: Ahem!
Andy: Excuse me. 
Dwight: I got it. I got it. 
Andy: [turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge? 
Darryl: [whispering] They're a bunch of jackals. 
Andy: What?
Darryl: They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home. 
Andy: [to Dwight, Stanley, and Phyllis]: Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture. 
 
Andy: Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on? 
Dwight: [whispering] You're gonna blow it. 
Andy: Maybe. Only maybe. 
 
Oscar: We got it! Wow! We got it! 
Pam: Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself. 
Oscar: Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes. 
Erin: Yes. 
Oscar: [pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have "apoplexy" if you lose. Do you understand? "Apoplexy" is what I will have. 
Erin: Apoplexy. 
Oscar: Yes. 
Erin: Got it. [plays word] Oh, Oscar. Oscar? 
 
Erin: I played "ape."
 
Jim: [on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
 
Andy: Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so... 
Michael: [as Mikanos] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you. [exits conference room] [normal voice] All, you have to close right now. 
Andy: Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it. 
Michael: No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it. 
Andy: Yeah, yeah. 
Michael: Andy, what's the problem? 
Andy: This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy. 
Michael: You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. [entering conference room] [as Mikanos] What is taking that guy so long? 
 
Jim: Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer? 
Pam: I don't know. They're still in there. 
Jim: Ohh! Good-bye. 
Pam: Stop. Out with it. 
 
Pam: Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom. 
Jim: Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually. 
Pam: And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group. 
Jim: I was blue group, so it was second from the top. 
Pam: And Tom...
Jim: Was in the green group. 
Pam: And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence. 
Jim: And that's what I told him. 
Pam: Right. But how'd you say it? 
Jim: "My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with."
 
Andy: Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now? 
Older Woman: I'll take one. 
Andy: Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right! 
Kelly: Yeah bitch. 
Andy: Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life. 
Michael: [quietly] No, no, no. 
Andy: But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime. 
Kelly: Whoo! 
 
Tom: Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda? 
Jim: Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead. 
Tom: Hey. 
Jim: Hey. 
Tom: How's it goin'?
Jim: Pretty good. 
Tom: It's been a while. 
Jim: It has been, yeah. 
Tom: So you work here, huh? 
Jim: Sales. 
Tom: Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory. [laughs]
Jim: [laughs] 
Tom: 'Cause you're so smart. 
Jim: Oh, man. You remember that, huh? 
Tom: Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius. 
Jim: All right, good catch-up. 
Tom: Yeah. 
Jim: See ya. 
Tom: Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg? 
 
Dwight: Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya. 
Andy: Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em. 
 
Holly: [with accent] Wonderful seminar! 
Michael: [as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on. 
Holly: Michael, I should get back to work. 
Michael: What? Come on. It's time for grapes. [regular voice] Real fun day. 
 
Gabe: So, I won. 
Erin: I know. You get to pick. 
Gabe: Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch "Wall-e". 
Erin: Yes? 
Gabe: So I got us a compromise. This movie's called "Hardware". It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married... 
Andy: Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it. 
Erin: There's a "Shrek" two?!
Andy: Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow. 
Gabe: Nice guy. 
Erin: Ohh. [laughs]

Kelly: Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement. 
Erin: Oh my gosh!
Phyllis: Wow. 
Kelly: Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
Meredith: Sweet! Free Ring! 
Andy: Divorced?
Ryan: Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
Kelly: The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Pam: Wait. Can you back up? What's the story? 
Kelly: We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot. 
Ryan: It's not irrelevant. Details 
Kelly: And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
Ryan and Kelly: I don't think I should be married to you anymore. 
Kevin: What?
Andy: Sorry, when did you get married?
Kelly: Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right. 
Andy: And you didn't invite any of us?
Ryan: We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time. 
Kelly: God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake. 
Ryan: No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married. 
Oscar: You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married. 
Ryan: No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
Kelly: Ryan, I changed my mind. 
Ryan: Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side? 
Kelly: And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
 
Jim: All right. Bye.
Pam: Bye. 
Jim: Let's Go!
Michael: Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
Holly: For what?
Michael: You broke up with AJ weeks ago. 
Holly: Don't you have a sales call to go on? 
Michael: I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
Holly: We don't know that. 
Michael: Sure we do. 
Holly: Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Michael: Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody. 
Holly: Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that. 
Michael: Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree. 
Holly: Well you don't have to agree. 
Michael: Yes I do. 
Holly: No you don't. 
Michael: Yes I do. 
Holly: No, you can have your own opinion. 
Michael: I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you. 
Jim: He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with. 
Pam: Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny "Jim" game. 
Jim: That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
Pam: All right, what'd you do?
Jim: Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art. 
Pam: Where'd you put it?
Jim: Where'd I put what?
Michael: Let's go. 
Jim: Oh, sorry gotta go.
Pam: Say it. Where? 
Jim: Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer. 
Pam: The fridge. 
Jim: Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance. 
Pam: The fridge, got it. 
Jim: And the final clue... 
Michael: Let's go!
Jim: You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine. 
Pam: Bye.
 
Erin: Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts. 
 
Jim: Cheer up. We made a sale. 
Michael: Just drive faster. I want to get back. 
Jim: Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...
Michael: Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit. 
Jim: Someone's in a bad mood. 
Michael: No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim? 
Jim: Alright, let me turn on some music. 
Michael: I need to pee. 
Jim: No you don't.
Michael: Yeah, I do. My word against yours. 
Jim: Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes. 
Michael: What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car. 
Jim: Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over. 
Michael: Well I hope I make it. 
 
Jim: Hello?
Helen: Hi Jim, it's Helen. 
Jim: Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
Helen: Everything is fine. Baby's fine. She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about. 
Jim: Ok... 
Helen: A tiny thing. I locked her in the car. 
Jim: What? 
Helen: She's smiling. She's happy. 
Jim: Oh my God. 
Helen: Jim, I don't have a spare key. 
Jim: Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please? 
Guy: [towards bathroom] Hello? [gives up and drives off]
 
Pam: This is Pam. 
Jim: Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok. 
Pam: What's wrong?
Jim: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
Pam: Jim, what?
Jim: Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car. 
Pam: Oh God! What?!
Jim: No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra. 
Pam: Ok. She's ok?
Jim: Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet. 
Pam: Understood. 
Jim: And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me. 
Pam: Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a "Ask Pam Beasley". ... Did the phone cut off?
Jim: Nope. 
Pam: Alright, just call me after the doctor. 
Jim: Ok. Bye. 
Pam: Bye.
 
Michael: I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted. 
Attendant: No, he ditched you man. I saw him drive away. 
Michael: There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please! 
Attendant: Just make it quick. 
Michael: Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. [opens phone] And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it? 
Attendant: You don't know it. 
Michael: You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number. 
Attendant: He left you here on purpose. All right? I saw it. He just drove away. 
 
Michael: Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. [to cameras] Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok. 
 
Holly: It's the gas station on Benet Street? 
Pam: Yeah. 
Holly: Ok. 
Erin: You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
Holly: Oh no no no. I'll be fine. 
Erin: It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along. 
Dwight: Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat. 
 
Pam: Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
Oscar: Which on in particular?
Andy: Yeah, which one? 
Pam: Well the first one has a surprise factor. "I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!"
Andy: Boo-yea! [office laughs]
Gabe: No no. No no no. 
Pam: But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line. 
Oscar: You suppose?
Darryl: What's it say? 
Oscar: "I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again." 
Gabe: Ok. [office laughs] No no no. 
Kevin: Red gloves. 
Darrly: Keep it real. 
Pam: You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging. 
Darryl: And I will take you all down.
Andy: You?
Darryl: I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me. 
Andy: Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton. 
Pam: Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes. 
Andy: Woo-hoo. 
Kevin: I can't wait. 
 
Dwight: Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial. 
Erin: He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox. 
Attendant: Yeah, he just left. 
Holly: Which way did he go?
Dwight: Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way. 
Holly: Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Attendant: She's right. He went that way. 
Dwight: Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker. [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride. 
 
Michael: [at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. [holding puppy] Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? [licks his nose] I'm being serious. Seriously. 
 
Pam: [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. 
Dwight: Has Michael checked in?
Pam: Oh, hey Dwight. 
Dwight: I asked you a question.
Pam: No, he hasn't. 
Dwight: Goodbye.
Pam: No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought... 
Dwight: Pam, this isn't a shopping trip. 
Erin: No.
Dwight: This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
Pam: Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out... 
Dwight: Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up. 
Pam: Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
Dwight: No word from Michael. 
Holly: Oh. 
 
Pam: Ta-da!
Kevin: Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island. 
Oscar: Ok. I got one. 
Pam: Yeah?
Oscar: Yes! 
Gabe: Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down. 
Office: Boo! 
Meredith: Why?
Gabe: Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed. 
Darryl: Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game. 
Gabe: Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for. 
Oscar: Irony is such a critical... 
Gabe: Number two: no pop culture references. 
Pam: Seriously? 
Oscar: Wow. 
Gabe: I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other. 
Darryl: Wrap it up, Gabe. 
Gabe: Ok final thing, and this is a fun one: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre. 
 
Gabe: Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day. 
 
Gabe: Go get 'em. Start quipin'. 
Oscar: Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM. 
Pam: Oh! Ok. 
Darryl: Send me one too. 
Andy: Yeah, yeah. Put me on that. 
Phyllis: C.C
Kevin: Ditto.
 
Michael: Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog. 
Hot Dog Guy: I'm not a pawn shop. 
Michael: Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
Hot Dog Guy: Wow. 
Michael: With that I can buy... half the menu. 
Hot Dog Guy: I can't just go giving away hot dogs. 
Michael: All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
Hot Dog Guy: Throw 'em away. 
Michael: Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?
Hot Dog Guy: No. 
Michael: Okay. You've just lost my business. 
 
Dwight: Hey. 
Erin: Hey, you were in there forever. 
Dwight: There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
Erin: She wandered off like an idiot. 
Dwight: Hey!
Holly: Hey. 
Dwight: What are you doing?
Holly: Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go. I'll take my free stress ball too now. 
Cell Phone Sales Person: Sure thing. Here you go, Miss... Okay, Fanny Smellmore. Real original. 
Holly: What?
Cell Phone Sales Person: You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me. 
Dwight: Tootenbacher. 
Erin: Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that... 
Dwight and Erin: farts popcorn. 
Dwight: Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
Holly: Are their egg rolls really that big?
 
Michael: Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?
Waiter: No problem. 
Michael: Okay. I'll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people. 
Waiter: So you can't pay for your food?
Michael: Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
Waiter: You did not. You have no money. And you dined so much. 
Michael: Well the number three is not such a giant feast. 
Waiter: [calling to the back] Mr. Chu! 
Micahel: Okay, all right. You know what? 
Waiter: You were trying to steal food from us?
Michael: I am not. I just have had a bad day. And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now. 
Waiter: You can't. We'll stop you. 
Michael: Well, I think I can get through the door. 
 
Dwight: Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian... 
Erin: [point to picture] It's Michael! 
Waiter: He just left. 
Erin: You knew. 
Holly: What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
Dwight: Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
Waiter: I think he was heading downtown. 
Dwight: He's heading downtown. 
 
Gabe: So what, no one's even gonna try? 
Pam: Guess not. 
Gabe: Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive. 
Darryl: You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
Gabe: Hey... 
Stanley: [whispers] Click the "x"
Phyllis: [whispers] I'm clicking!
Stanley: In the box. 
Phyllis: I am clicking. 
Stanley: Woman, you've had a computer for years!
Andy: Phyllis!
Gabe: Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter. 
Andy: Oooohhh. 
 
Gabe: "Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat." [laughter]
Kevin: Nice!
Gabe: No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs. 
Andy: Do the next one. 
Gabe: "Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.' 
Darryl: Dreaming he's a dog on a island. 
Gabe: Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
Phyllis: Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
Gabe: Umm... "You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here." Ha. 
Oscar: That's tasteless, Gabe. 
Gabe: Tasteless?
Oscar: Tasteless. 
Gabe: More tasteless than this..."is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it." [laughter] 
Pam: Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner. 
Phyllis: Yes. 
Kevin: Yes, well done! 
Oscar: Who's is it? Who wrote that? 
Phyllis: Yeah, who wrote it? 
 
Angela: Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe. 
 
Erin: Where did he go, Holly? 
Holly: I have no idea. 
Dwight: Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, "this way, this way"?
Holly: I don't know. 
Dwight: Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you! 
Holly: Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all. 
Dwight: All right then. Someone propose a plan. 
Erin: Okay. We fan out...
Dwight: Not you, Erin. 
Holly: Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below. 
Dwight: That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next. 
Holly: Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him. 
Erin: Good. We don't need her. 
Dwight: Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling. 
 
Holly: [walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael? 
Michael: Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here? 
Holly: What are you doing up here? 
Michael: I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin. 
Holly: Dunder Mifflin.
Michael: Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much. 
Holly: I missed you too. 
Michael: Really? 
Holly: Yeah. 
Michael: Can I kiss you?
Holly: Yeah. 
Michael: Okay. 
 
Phyllis: Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading. 
Gabe: Uh, it was. 
Meredith: Maybe it wasn't. 
Gabe: "Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe."
Andy: Oh! [laughter]
Phyllis: No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
Gabe: "I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull[bleep]. [laughter] "Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo." 
Andy: [laughs]
Gabe: "Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her."
Phyllis: Yeah, there you go. [laughter] 

Pam: Hey. How you doing?
Darryl: Thinking about my grandmother a lot. 
Pam: Yeah. 
Darryl: She was about to turn 97. 
Pam: At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you. 
Darryl: Thank you. "Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted." "Have fun today, big guy." "Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop."
Pam: It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday. 
Darryl: "Hooray. Live it up big D. " "Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this"? 
Andy: Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!
Pam: I'm so sorry. 
Darryl: [tears welling up in his eyes]
Andy: ...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
 
Andy: ...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work. 
Darryl: Rachel from the party?
Andy: Oh, yeah! 
Darryl: Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
Phyllis: Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene. 
Holly: Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you. 
Michael: Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me. 
Holly: Bye. 
Michael: Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye. 
Holly: Okay, one more quick one. 
Michael: Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go. 
 
Michael: Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you. 
 
Gabe: And what do we have here? 
Erin: From my secret admirer. That's you! 
Gabe: Come on. 
 
Gabe: I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science. 
 
Erin: "Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue." Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt! 
Gabe: Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck. 
Erin: But, there's no clue. 
Gabe: Well, get to work. 
Erin: I can't, 'cause there's no clue. 
Gabe: The puzzle is the clue. 
Erin: Oh. 
 
Oscar: [clears throat]
Michael: [rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct? 
Oscar: The numbers are correct, Michael. 
Michael: Okay. 
Oscar: [clears throat more loudly]
Michael: Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out. 
Oscar: I jus... I just need a signature. 
 
Jim: [getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks. 
Pam: How much did you give him?
Jim: Big tip. 
Pam: Wait. I don't have my scarf. 
Jim: What? 
Pam: I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh]
 
Jim: We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing. 
Pam: [loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful! 
Jim: Shh. 
Pam: Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there? 
Jim: Um, bottomless champagne. 
Pam: Yes. Never found that bottom, did we? 
Jim: No. 
 
Erin: Psst! Psst! 
Andy: What's up?
Erin: Are you good at jigsaw puzzles? 
Andy: Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing. 
Erin: Okay. 
Andy: But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...
Erin: Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends. 
Andy: Well, okay then. 
Erin: Yes!
Andy: At least until Stanley calms down. 
Erin: Oh, is he...
Andy: D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]
Erin: Andy. 
 
Jim: [on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
Dwight: Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat] 
Jim: [goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait. 
Dwight: You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine. 
Jim: Aww, nuts. [laughs]
 
Angela: I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA. 
Oscar: Yes! The freaking PDA! 
Angela: Uh-huh. 
Oscar: Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them. 
Angela: No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
Oscar: Yes, yes, absolutely. 
Angela: ...but it's totally inappropriate. 
Darryl: Yeah, it's a little much. 
Phyllis: Mm-hmm. 
Darryl: Obviously, so happy for them both. 
Oscar: So happy. Yeah. 
Kevin: I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
Angela: No, stop! Just don't. 
Oscar: Kevin! 
Kevin: Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny. 
Everyone: [groans] 
Angela: God! Kevin! 
 
Erin: So tell me about your new girlfriend. 
Andy: She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there. 
Erin: Aww, cute. 
Andy: Hey, look at that. Done. 
Erin: That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it. 
Andy: I wish you well on your quest. 
Erin: No, come on. 
Andy: Aww, I mean...
Erin: [growling] Come on! 
Andy: Okay. 
Erin: Ha! 
 
Gabe: [to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just...[makes popping sound] like it's coming from my own head. 
Michael: Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]
Holly: Ohh. Can you get lower?
Michael: Oh, yeah. 
Holly: A little lower. 
 
Holly: I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head. 
 
Gabe: Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice. 
Michael: [clears throat]
Gabe: Yes?
Michael: [sitting in Holly's lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
Gabe: Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace. 
Michael: Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on. 
Gabe: First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances. 
Ryan: Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting. 
Meredith: Uh, I also don't see Andy. 
Kevin: Oooh. 
Jim: OOH! Boom! Face! 
Gabe: I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam. 
Pam: Yeah. What? Us?
Gabe: They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife. 
Jim: Did it! 
Pam: Yeah! 
Jim: Love it. Keep it goin. 
Gabe: Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...
Kevin: Booby honking. 
Gabe: Yeah, booby honking. Sure. 
Kevin: Butt honking. 
Gabe: Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking. 
Creed: The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...
Gabe: Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem. 
Oscar: Are you guys listening to this? 
Michael: What, are you talking about me and Holly? 
Pam: Yeah! 
Gabe: Maybe you find your own chair. 
 
Holly: So we kiss occasionally. 
Oscar: Not occasionally. All the time. 
Phyllis: Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering. 
Stanley: The flirtatious tickling. 
Michael: Whispering and tickling have their place in business. 
Darryl: That thing were you softly exhale on her neck. 
Michael: I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it. 
Dwight: Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office. 
Michael: Thank you. 
Dwight: I've had intercourse in the office. 
Michael: All right. 
Dwight: As has Angela!
Angela: Dwight! 
Dwight: As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly. 
Kevin: As has Kevin!
Angela: With who?
Kevin: She goes to another school. 
Michael: Okay. Fine. No more PDA. 
Oscar: Good. 
Michael: You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone. 
Angela: No. 
Michael: Anything goes. 
Oscar: Just leave it how you said...
Dwight: Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time? 
Michael: Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
Dwight: And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation? 
Michael: Pro. 
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: What? Problem solved. 
 
Michael: No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises. 
 
Pam: That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right? 
Jim: Mm-hmm. 
Pam: You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him. 
Jim: [snorts] Ew. 
 
Erin: Don't mind us. You keep working. 
Darryl: Okay. I'll keep working. 
Erin: Oh, my God. It's a song. 
Andy: Whoa. 
Erin: What do you think is on it? 
Andy: [softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad. 
Erin: [softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us. 
Andy: I think he can hear us. 
Andy: [softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level. 
Erin: Darryl. 
Andy: Darryl is a jerk. 
Erin: No, he's not. 
Andy: No, I'm just testing if he can hear. 
Darryl: I can hear you. 
Andy: Oh. Okay. 
Erin: Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song. 
Boom Box: [Gabe singing] The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night. 
Andy: The temp at night?
Erin: What do you...
Darryl: You got it. Pick it up. Take it out. 
Andy: Pi...
Darryl: Pick it up. 
Andy: Okay. 
Darryl: Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out. 
Andy: Right. Okay. 
 
Holly: Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things. 
Michael: Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working. 
Holly: Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable. 
Michael: Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt. 
Holly: Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable. 
Michael: Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop. 
Holly: Okay. 
 
Michael: Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart. 
 
Michael: Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day. 
Holly: Two people in love? 
Michael: I love you. 
Holly: Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, "oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl." Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
Michael: I love you-love you. 
Holly: Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]
Michael: I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand]
Holly: I love you. 
 
Michael: Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me. 
 
Andy: Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night? 
Erin: I guess we just have to wait until night and see. 
Andy: Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]
Erin: [gasps] Oh. Cool. 
Andy: How romantic is this? 
Erin: Super romantic. 
Andy: Right. Do you see a clue or...
Erin: Yeah. Did you not see it? ["Eat at Hanks" is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
Andy: Oh, my gosh. 
Erin: Hanks. 
 
Jim and Pam: Hey! 
Andy and Erin: [bursting out of Ryan's closet] Hey. 
Andy: No time to chat. 
Erin: Sorry. 
Jim: Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here. 
Ryan: Hey. You're looking for me?
Pam: Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey. 
Ryan: No you weren't. 
Pam: No, we weren't. 
Ryan: You wanted to have sex in my office. 
Pam: No. 
Jim: Definitely not. That's disgusting. 
Ryan: No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here. 
Jim: Hey, you don't have to...
Pam: That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die. 
Jim: That was really rough. 
 
Pam: Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office. 
Jim: No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place. 
Pam: Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed. 
Jim: And a shower. 
 
Michael: Hello, Holly. 
Holly: Hello. 
Michael: Here, shake. No!
Holly: No, don't touch. 
Michael: No, we can't. 
Holly: No touching. 
Michael: No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you. 
Holly: Oh. 
Michael: Oh. 
Holly: Almost got you. 
Michael: Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh. 
Holly: You're not touching me. 
Michael: I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it. 
Oscar: Okay, this is much worse than before. 
Kevin: Yeah, I agree. This is nasty. 
Michael: Grab you here. 
Holly: And here. 
Michael: I will grab you here anyway. [laughs]
 
Gabe: You have to cut it out. 
Holly: Okay. 
Michael: Never. 
Holly: You said you would. 
Michael: I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained. 
Gabe: No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling. 
Holly: No, I don't think so. 
Gabe: Number two: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior. 
Michael: Yes, it was that. It's that one. 
Holly: Yes. Number three. 
 
Holly: Give me all your money and take off your clothes. 
Michael: We're not supposed to PDA. 
Holly: Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong? 
Michael: I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua. 
Holly: Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance. 
Michael: That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different? 
Holly: We weren't in love last time. 
Michael: I was in love with you. 
Holly: I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said. 
Michael: [chuckles, sighs]
 
Erin: Oh. One Erin Special, please. 
Hank: Here's your bottle of sparkling cider. 
Andy: Hey. 
Erin: [laughs] That's my favorite. 
Hank: I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some [bleep] in the break room when you're through. 
 
Kevin: [through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy! 
Darryl: Make that face he likes. 
Dwight: Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him. 
Michael: It's like a time bomb...
Dwight: Shh. 
Michael: ...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging. 
Dwight: Just hush. 
Michael: Sexual time bomb. 
Dwight: Just rock. Shh. 
Michael: [into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
Dwight: Movie idea? 
Michael: No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard. 
Dwight: Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap. 
Michael: No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending. 
Dwight: Kevin! Do more stupid faces. 
Kevin: Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces. 
Dwight: I don't know. 
Michael: Do the monkey face. 
Dwight: Do the monkey face! 
Michael: I love that. I love that face. 
Dwight: Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down. 
Michael: No. The monkey! 
Dwight: Go back to the monkey! 
Michael: Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop. 
Dwight: Hurl your feces. 
Michael: That's good. 
Dwight: Good. 
Michael: That's good. He's throwing it. 
Dwight: They really do that. 
Michael: I know. 
 
Erin: [at vending machine] B-9.
Andy: B-9.
Erin: Like a benign tumor. 
Andy: Maybe it's just more like, "be mine."
Erin: Oh, yes. There's a note. "A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss."
Andy: Mm. 
Erin: Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
Andy: Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]
 
Michael: Holly. Hey. 
Holly: Hi. 
Michael: Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up. 
Holly: What? What are you talking about? 
Michael: Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
Holly: No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me. 
Michael: You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...
Holly: What if I said it wasn't up to them? 
Michael: Who?
Holly: The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me. 
Michael: Okay. Okay. 
 
Michael: Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
Oscar: Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up. 
Kevin: Better luck next time, pal. 
Michael: Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu. 
Holly: You do? 
Michael: I do. 
Oscar: Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
Kevin: Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you. 
Oscar: I just told them to do it! 
 
Jim: What? 
Pam: No. 
Jim: No. We took a walk. 
Pam: We took a walk. 
 
Dwight: My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago. 
 
Ryan: Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year. 
 
Kelly: Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me... 
 
Kevin: Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with. 
 
Michael: What are our plans for tonight? Umm...
Holly: [imitates a squeaky bed] [laughter]


Delivery Guy: I got a delivery for ya'.
Michael: Leave it at reception.
Delivery: I'm supposed to deliver this one in person. [pulls out a gun and starts shooting at Michael, who dodges dramatically]
Michael: [pulls out two handguns and kills the man with an unnecessarily large amount of bullets] Clean up on aisle five. [Threat Level: Midnight titlescreen appears]
 
Michael: After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level: Midnight.
 
Michael: Erin... what are you doing?
Erin: Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
Michael: That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.
 
Jim: Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
Pam: We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie. 
Jim: Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
Pam: Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
 
Pam: We'd love to see it!
Michael: Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
Pam: Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
Creed: Thanks mom.
 
Holly: You never told me you made a movie.
Michael: Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.
Holly: It's got you.
Michael: It's got a lot of me.
Holly: [laughs] I can't wait.
 
Michael: Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. [applause]
 
Narrator: [Stanley's voice as the screen shows Scarn Manor] Michael Scarn, well that's an interesting story. [headlines of Michael Scarn's success are shown as well as an article reporting the death of Michael's wife, Catherine Zeta Scarn] He was once the best secret agent in the business. That was years ago. Where is he now? Well, that's also an interesting story.
Samuel: [Dwight Schrute dressed as a butler. Speaks in slow, deep voice] Master Scarn.
 
Dwight: I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
 
Michael: Dwight does not play a robot.
 
Samuel: [crashes cymbals by Michael's ear]
Michael: [lying on bed with a bottle of alcohol] I'm up.
Samuel: It's the president. He needs you for a mission.
Michael: Tell him I'm retired.
Dwight: It's Goldenface.
Michael: Goldenface, this makes it personal. 
 
President: [Darryl, sitting at a desk in the Oval Office] Scarn, you're right on time. [cheering from the office]
 
Daryl: I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.
 
President: It's your old enemy, Goldenface. He's after the NHL All Star Game. He's hidden a bomb somewhere in the stadium. Scarn, this one is personal for me. I own the stadium. I can't see it blown up. It's my retirement plan.
Samuel: We have to search the stadium.
President: Not so fast, Goldenface has taken all the concession stand workers hostage. Scarn, will you find these hostages, and save the game?
Michael: [holding a quarter up] Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven. [flips the coin] Heads. [flips it again] Tails. [President winces each time he says tails]...Heads...Tails...Heads...Tails. [flips one more time and the quarter spins around on the table. Michael looks at it] Well, it looks like there's going to be a clean-up on aisle five.
 
Narrator: Well, the hostages were scared.
 
Kevin: [as a hostage] Don't you guys get it? Nobody's coming for us.
Goldenface: [Jim, with his face painted with metallic gold paint] Oh someone's coming alright, the only man who would care. [Goldenface turns in his chair, holding a golden gun] Michael Scarn. See I'm gonna lure him here, then I kill everybody, then... I'm gonna dig up Scarn's dead wife, and I'm gonna hump her real good. [malicious, deep laughter]
 
Jim: I did not love the dialogue. Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
 
Narrator: [scene shows Michael Scarn driving through the rain] Well, the All Star Game was three days away, so naturally it was all sold out. The only way Scarn was getting in was in a uniform. Just one problem with that, Scarn didn't know a hockey stick from a Slim Jim. So he went to meet with the famed trainer... [Michael stops the car and gets out] Cherokee Jack.
 
Cherokee Jack: [Creed wearing a tunic and carrying a mop, standing with Michael in front of an ice rink] Mop the ice.
Michael: I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey.
Cherokee Jack: Mop it. [A montage of Michael mopping the ice awkwardly and using an ab-cruncher, and slowly getting better. After a little while, Cherokee Jack Slams a hockey stick on the ice to stop Michael, then offers it to him] Now take this.
Michael: What am I supposed to do with this?
Cherokee Jack: Mop. [a montage shows Michael sliding around the ice skillfully and hitting the puck into the goal]
 
Narrator: Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country.
 
Ryan: [Ryan is acting as an official for the competition taking place. A line is formed in front of a line on the ice. Standing behind it are Michael Scarn, Oscar in a blue full-body suit, and a mysterious man in a hockey mask] Each year, the National Hockey League selects one civilian amateur to play in the All Star Game. It's down to the three of you. The final test is speed skating. [holds a gun to the ceiling] On your marks, get set...
Goldenface: Die! [The masked man pulls off the mask to reveal that it is Goldenface]
Michael: [Michael and Goldenface skate around the rink, Goldenface shooting with a solid gold gun, Michael with two pistols. Michael is out of breath at the end of the race] Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me.
Goldenface: I wasn't trying to kill you, I was trying to slow you down. [Ryan is seen placing a medal around Oscar's neck]
Michael: No!
Goldenface: Oh by the way!
Michael: Yeah?
Goldenface: How's your wife doing?
Michael: [begins to cry as Goldenface laughs]
 
Michael: Congratulations.
Oscar: Hey, you came in second. Not bad either.
Michael: I am sorry that I have to do this... [starts choking Oscar to death with his towel]
Oscar: Huh...[muffled screaming as he slowly chokes, and eventually dies]
Michael: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
 
Samuel: I'm intercepting a name. Jasmine Winsong. She works for Goldenface. What I can't figure out is, who is the Funky Cat.
Michael: Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town. [stands up with his cup of tea and walks by Samuel, pouring his tea all over him]
Samuel: Oh-[starts to freak out, but the scene is crudely cut short]
 
Dwight: He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
 
Jan: [acting as a jazz singer at the Funky Cat, singing] They call me Jasmine Winsong.
 
Michael: [walking into the Funky Cat] Bingo.
 
Jan: He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
 
Jan: [singing gibberish while laying on the piano on stage]
Michael: [pulls out a recording device from his pocket and clicks it on]
Jan: [michael pushes the backwards button on the recorder] The hostages are under the stadium. [An assassin with a golden tie shoots her with a tranquilizer and she falls]
Michael: Jack Blaise.
 
Pam: You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families!
Goldenface: Ha! This is gonna show them [cocks his golden gun] that I mean business. See ya! [points gun to Toby the hostage's head, shoots and Toby's fake head explodes, the shot is shown repeatedly]
 
Michael: By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
 
Samuel: Ha! [kicking open the gate in the stadium where the hostages and Goldenface are]
Kevin: Michael Scarn!
Goldenface: Sorry about your friend, Scarn!
Michael: The joke's on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.
Goldenface: [gives Michael a disgusted look]
Samuel: We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?
Goldenface: Hm?
Samuel: We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?
Goldenface: Hm?
Samuel: We've searched the wh- ok...
Michael: He said, where is the bomb?
Goldenface: In the puck! [tosses the puck to Michael]
Michael: Why are you telling me this?
Goldenface: Because I'm going to kill you. [takes out golden gun] Unless! You forgive me for murdering your wife. [distraught, memories of him and his wife are shown on the puck in a dreamy haze]
Michael: Hey Goldenface.
Goldenface: Yeah?
Michael: Go puck yourself!
Goldenface: [dodges the puck and shoots at Michael]
Samuel: Noooo! [jumps in front of Michael to receive the bullet]
 
Michael: That was not scripted.
 
Goldenface: [re-cocks gun and shoots at Michael, who looks shocked and scared]
 
Michael: More Tylenol.
Helene: [as a busty nurse] You've already had four.
Pam: Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God... [looks at Michael] So good.
Helene: You're lucky to be alive.
Michael: It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn.
Helene: Let's just make sure that everything's... Working properly... [leans in closer to Michael and the heart rate monitor, which was beating steadily, now beats very quickly]
 
President: You just said the bomb... is in the puck?
Michael and Samuel together: Yes.
President: Is that where you hid the bomb Goldenface?
Goldenface: [walks into the Oval Office with an accomplice, Troy]
Samuel: But why would you blow up the stadium? You OWN the stadium!
Michael: For the insurance money! I knew it all along! [the President, Goldenface, and his minion pull out automatic machine guns] You will never get away with this! [takes a painting of Abraham Lincoln and awkwardly smashes it on the President's head, runs out of the office as Goldenface and his minion shoot at them]
 
Michael: Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up.
 
Narrator: It wasn't easy for Scarn to admit that he had lost his self-confidence. And he hadn't of course, He just wasn't using it right now.
 
Michael: [in a bar] Beer me Billy.
Billy: [Andy as a bar tender with a Brooklyn accent] You don't looks so good, what's got ya down?
Michael: I got problems Billy. Big problems...
Billy: You got problems?! My TV don't work! I pay thirty bucks a month for the damn satellite what's-a-whosit, I can't even get the damn game! Now you tell me, what's worse than that?
Michael: [laughs to himself] Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.
Billy: I see what you mean about problems. I know what'll cheer you up. That table of bachelorettes over there bought you this drink. [a table with Meredith, Phyllis, Karen, and Angela all say hey to Michael]
Karen: Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby? [winks]
 
Karen: Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
 
Michael: I'm too depressed to save the big game Billy.
Billy: I'm gonna cheer you up, the only ways I know hows. [to a small boy in overalls] Hey kid! Hit G-9 on the Jukebox!
Michael: No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died.
Billy: There is a whole crowd of people out there, who need to learn, how to do The Scarn.
Michael: [A funky beat sounds from the Jukebox and Michael starts dancing poorly] Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way. [the bachelorettes and the others in the bar stand up to join him] You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! [doing the actions he says to] You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!
Todd Packer: [as a drunken man in the bar] If doing The Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest queer on Earth!
 
Jim: [cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Michael: [turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]
Jim: I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
Kelly: Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
Kevin: It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
Ryan: You should enter it in festivals!
Kevin: Or carnivals!
Michael: [to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
Holly: Uh... which part?
Michael: Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...
Andy: Some people are really popping on screen!
 
Michael: Hey.
Holly: Hey! Good movie.
Michael: Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
Holly: I loved it.
Michael: Did you? What did you love about it?
Holly: Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
 
Michael: No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.
Holly: Uhm...
Michael: Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
Holly: Not worried about that.
Michael: [angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.
Holly: Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
Michael: I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
Holly: Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
Michael: Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
Holly: Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
Michael: I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
Holly: I'm real.
Michael: Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.
Holly: I love you too.
 
Michael: I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
 
Michael: Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval]
 
Samuel: Michael! You have to get to that puck before halftime! Or the whole stadium will explode!
Michael: I know, it's a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!
Samuel: Cherokee Jack? Michael he died.
Michael: [crying] This one's for you Cherokee Jack. [Michael skates into the rink of an already in-play match]
 
Michael: We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.
 
Jim: [he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
Michael: No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]
 
Pam: Why is your face gold?
Goldenface: Why do you care?
Pam: I'm just making conversation.
Goldenface: I worked in a gold factory, we had a boss, who only cared about money...
 
Michael: Hey...
Holly: Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.
Michael: No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
 
Hostage: Please Goldenface, let us go! 
 
Michael: [ees Cherokee Jack from a confusion of heavenly light and smoke] Cherokee Jack.
Cherokee Jack: I want you to take all of your frustrations, with women, the system, with everything. Take it out on the puck. All on the puck.
 
Michael: [laughs at the stupidity]
 
Michael: [skates forward, hits the puck, and stares in wonder as it flies by]
 
Samuel: Yah! [kicks open the gate to save the hostages, hostages rejoice as Samuel unties them] [the puck is seen flying into space and it hits a satellite, Billy is at his bar and his TV suddenly turns back on]
 
Billy: Hey! We got sports games again! [people at the bar cheer]
 
Goldenface: [seen at his house counting his money] Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! [The puck lands on his lap] Oh-[A large explosion blocks out his words] [The office cheers at the ending of the movie, Michael Scarn holds up a trophy]
 
Michael: [in Scarn manor] Some breakfast for me [shows a plate of bacon and eggs] and some breakfast for you. [pulls out an oil can and oils Samuel's circuit board on his back]
 
Michael: Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
 
Michael: [phone rings] I'll get it! Man I love being retired! Scarn here!
President: [on phone] Michael, it's the president.
Michael: Hello sir.
President: I need you for another mission.
Michael: Ugh... [after a little thought] I'm in.
 
Andy: [the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
Michael: Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is! 
Dwight: No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
Michael: No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]
 
Narrator: [in Stanley's voice, a chair is shown with a gray haired head sticking above it] Well, Michael Scarn was back in the game. And I bet you're wondering why do I know so much about Michael Scarn. [the chair revolves to show Michael Scarn, gray haired, talking with Stanley's voice] Well because I AM Michael Scarn. [applause]
 
Rapper: [Andy rapping to a montage of scenes from the movie] Ahhhh, yeah! Threat Level Midnight! Makes all the girlies feel alright! From Madonna to Madelyn Allbrite, Threat Level Midnight! It's a threat, a level, a level level threat. He's the greatest hockey-star I ever seen yet. Threat Level what? Midnight! Threat Level who? Michael Scarn! Threat Level why? Apartheid! Gotta fight it, Free Mandela! Peace I'm out!

Dwight: I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
 
Kevin: You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
Dwight: They're still good for another week.
Meredith: You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
Kevin: I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
Dwight: Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
Jim: Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
Dwight: No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
Jim: Three months.
Dwight: Could be.
Jim: Four months.
Dwight: I can see that happening, yes.
Jim: Eight months?
Dwight: That's a realistic time line.
Jim: [Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
Dwight: Perhaps.
Jim: Okay now really think hard about this one: One year.
Dwight: I can see that as a very real possibility.
Jim: [time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Dwight: I can see that happening.
Jim: Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
 
Todd: I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
Michael: Still not seeing the problem here.
Todd: All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
 
Michael: It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
 
Holly: [walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
Michael: Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss]
Holly: You must be Todd.
Todd: [shaking Holly's hand] Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
Holly: [laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
Todd: After you!
Michael: Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
Michael: Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots. 
Holly: All right.
Michael: And it also helps if you've had five shots.
Holly: I already have. 
Michael: Whoa!
Jim: [to Michael] Why is Packer back?
Michael: Is Packer here?
Dwight: Why's he talking to Holly?
Michael: [peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care.
Holly: [to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
Todd: [excitedly] Oh!
Michael: [sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
Kevin: Yes! 
Jim: What!?
Todd: It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!
Kevin: Nice! We got burned!
Michael: You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
Dwight: [seething] Holly, you approved this?
Holly: Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
Jim: You did approve it?
Holly: Yeah.
Kevin: What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
 
Kevin: I have very little patience for stupidity. 
 
Erin: [walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Gabe: I'm such a klutz!
Erin: Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
 
Pam: I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
 
Erin: Thank you Pam.
Pam: Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.
Jim: [Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
Pam: I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Jim: Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
Pam: So you know the feeling.
 
Michael: Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight: I didn't order anything.
Michael: And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
Dwight: Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Michael: So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]
Todd: Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.
Dwight: I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
Todd: well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
Dwight: No it is not.
Todd: Is too!
Michael: [Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this.
Todd: Check it out! 
Dwight: I don't wanna move desks!
Michael: Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
Jim: Do I have any say in this?!
Michael: No!
Todd: [grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don't even watch, Halpert!
 
Dwight: [in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
Holly: Oh, that's our Zen garden.
Dwight: What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
Pam: [walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
Holly: Hey, what's up guys?
Meredith: Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Jim: Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer? 
Holly: Uhm.
Pam: He's seriously awful!
Holly: Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
Meredith: That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
Jim: [Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Pam: United front...
Holly: Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
Ryan: Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
Kelly: What are you referencing?
Ryan: [seems unsure] Everything... Everything.
Holly: Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
Jim: Well, I mean he humped Michael.
Holly: Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
 
Andy: [looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
Erin: Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
Andy: Where did you get this?!
Erin: Pam gave it to me!
Andy: This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
Pam: You have a computer Andy.
Andy: Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
Pam: Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
Andy: Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
Pam: Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
Stanley: So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Andy: I'm not asking for one, I need it.
Phyllis: If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Andy: Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
Pam: See, this is what I'm talking about.
Andy: What are you gonna play mange on faster?
Pam: Sorry Andy.
 
Todd: Hey what's going on you guys? [walking into the kitchen with Holly, Dwight, and Kevin, with whom he fist bumps] Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
Kevin: [giggling] Mean but good!
Holly: So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
Todd: I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused]
Holly: Well, some girls go through a phase.
Kevin: Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
Todd: Since when did you learn how to read?
Kevin: I do know how to read though!
Todd: Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
Kevin: [Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Dwight: Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
 
Pam: [walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
Andy: It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
Pam: What? Erin is that true?
Erin: [nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Pam: Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
Andy: Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
Pam: I'm not freaking out, Andy.
Andy: -take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?
Pam: Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
Andy: That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
Pam: Switch the computers back Andy.
Andy: Seriously?
Pam: Seriously.
Andy: Pam! Come on!
Pam: Now please.
Andy: Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!
Erin: [to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
Michael: Best day ever. Best day ever!
Holly: So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
Michael: Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
Holly: No! No.
Michael: Please.
Holly: Did Todd tell you to do that?
Michael: Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.
Holly: I love you.
Michael: No. Not me, him.
Holly: That's certainly opinionated.
Erin: [looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
Holly: Oh I'm going.
Michael: Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
Holly: I don't think he's funnier than me.
Michael: He's funnier than me.
Holly: No, he's not funny at all.
Michael: So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
Erin: [very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Holly: No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Michael: [seems taken aback] Uhm...
Holly: Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
Michael: That's insane!
Holly: Honey, he's a jerk.
Erin: [getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
 
Todd: [to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right?
Jim: Yeah.
Todd: That's sweet. How's the sex?
Jim: [continues working]
Dwight: [walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
Todd: Why?
Dwight: 'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Jim: That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious]
Dwight: Drink it!
Todd: I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. [winks]
Jim: [interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
 
Jim: So, this hot chocolate thing.
Dwight: None of your business.
Jim: Well, you know you can't actually poison him. 
Dwight: It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Jim: I really think we should join forces on this one. 
Dwight: Really.
Jim: What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Dwight: I know.
Jim: Here we go.
Dwight: Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
Jim: You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Dwight: [mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Jim: Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
Dwight: Who is Justice Beaver?
Jim: He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Dwight: Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Jim: Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
Dwight: Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
 
Andy: Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
Pam: I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
Andy: Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
Pam: [looking confused] You did that?
Andy: Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
Pam: Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
Andy: Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
Pam: Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
Andy: You humiliated me in front of every body!
Pam: Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
Andy: I mean, it's pretty broken already.
Pam: Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
Andy: [looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door]
Ryan: [walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
 
Dwight: [to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
Jim: Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
Dwight: They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
Jim: One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
Dwight: Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
 
Andy: [Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!
 
Todd: [at Hank's with Michael, talking to Hank] And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that. [Hank smiles]
Michael: And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]
Todd: Why?
Michael: I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
Todd: Holly said that?
Michael: Yeah.
Holy: She was laughing hysterically that whole time!
Michael: I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
Todd: She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.
Michael: You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
Todd: Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
Michael: No it isn't.
Todd: You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.
Michael: Yeah, a little bit.
Todd: Don't give up on me. 
Michael: I won't.
 
Michael: [Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
Kevin: I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
Michael: Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
Kevin: That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Michael: Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
Todd: I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Kevin: Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
Michael: Kevin, do you accept the apology?
Kelly: Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
Michael: Okay, go back to the annex.
Kelly: This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Ryan: [muttering] Sometimes you over react. 
Oscar: Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
Todd: Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
Michael: That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
Angela: [cutting in] No! Don't!
Michael: I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
 
Pam: [in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up. 
Andy: No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
Pam: Andy, this is the deal we made.
Andy: [watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.
Pam: We should break this hinge maybe.
Andy: Let's not go crazy.
 
Todd: Well thanks, will do.
Jim: [using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
Todd: That sounds weird.
Jim: It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Dwight: [also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Jim: [trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Dwight: Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
 
Todd: Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd.
 
Dwight: Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back! 
Michael: What are you doing?
Jim: [trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
Michael: I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
Jim: He's a jerk.
Dwight: He took my desk.
Michael: Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
Dwight: It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Michael: You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
Dwight: No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
Michael: He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Jim: Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
 
Andy: [plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
Pam: Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Andy: Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
Pam: Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
Andy: All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
 
Todd: [walking into Michael's office] You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the "ass", in Tallahassee! 
Michael: Yes, about that.
Todd: Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
Michael: Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
Todd: Do you have a ball and chain?
Michael: No, nothing like that at all. 
Todd: Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.
Michael: Sorry?
Todd: I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.
Michael: [thinks a moment] Sounds great.
Todd: It's gonna be so good.
Michael: That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
 
Holly: I'm sorry about your friend. 
Michael: Nah, he's an ass.
Holly: [Brooklyn accent] You ahh.
Michael: [imitating] You ahh.
Holly: What ah you wicked smaht?
Michael: No you ahh.
Holly: Who ahh?
Michael: [kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.
 
Daryl: So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
Pam: Yep. Lucked out.
Daryl: Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse. 
Pam: Yep, super lucky.
Daryl: Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
Pam: [hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
Daryl: Really? 'Cause I think maybe I saw five.
Pam: Three. [Daryl nods]
 
Pam: I'm full on corrupt!

Pam: Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
Oscar: No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
Pam: Oh.
 
Pam: Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
 
Dwight: People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
Jim: Oh, yikes.
Pam: It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
Dwight: It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Pam: The signs will drive people inside.
Dwight: The warmth will lure people inside.
Andy: Close it.
Dwight: This is how business...
Andy: Close it.
Dwight: I'm not closing the door.
Andy: Close it. [starts wrestling Dwight]
Dwight: Stop it.
Andy: Just close it.
 
Dwight: Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
Meredith: Sure.
Dwight: Not so fast.
 
Dwight: Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
 
Dwight: I will trade you for the used candle.
Meredith: Forget you.
Dwight: Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
Meredith: Fine, just give it.
Dwight: That's how it's done.
 
Kevin: Woah, I love her. How much for that?
Michael: I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
Holly: 10 dollars.
Michael: Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
Kevin: 200.
Michael: 500.
Holly: 20.
Kevin: 45.
Michael: Get lost.
Kevin: Damn it.
Michael: That is how you do it.
Holly: You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
Michael: You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
Holly: Well we could put it in storage... in case.
Michael: In case... in case of what?
Holly: You know... in case if something changes.
Michael: I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
Holly: Nope.
Lady: How much for the slip and slide?
Michael: Get lost.
 
Michael: [on phone] Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
 
Kelly: Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
Dwight: Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
Kelly: Screw you man. People like my stuff.
Dwight: People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
Kelly: You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
Dwight: And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
 
Andy: Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
Kevin: Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Andy: Really?
Kevin: Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
Darryl: We should play it.
Andy: Well... there's no instructions.
Darryl: It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
Kevin: Yea.
Andy: I'm pretty good at board games.
Darryl: Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
Andy: Sure.
 
Dwight: What is this?
Jim: How did those get out? I'm sorry.
Dwight: Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
Jim: I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
Dwight: That's a common swindlers trick.
Jim: Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
Dwight: So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
Jim: Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Dwight: Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
 
Holly: Michael called Dad?
Holly's Mom: Your friend Michael, yes. What's going on?
Holly: Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
Holly's Dad: Holly?
Holly: Hi Dad.
Holly's Dad: There was a program on TV about India.
Holly: Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?
Holly's Dad: Wanna watch it?
Holly: I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
Holly's Dad: What are you doing there?
Holly: I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
Holly's Dad: I'll, I'll put your mother on.
Holly: No. No... no Dad.
Holly's Mom: Holly?
Holly: Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Holly's Mom: Don't you worry about him, he's got me.
Holly: Well who do you have?
Holly's Mom: I have your father. He's right here I'll put him on.
Holly: No. Mom?
 
Pam: Oh, which one is decaf?
Pam: [looks out window] Michael! Michael!
Michael: Hi.
Pam: Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
Michael: Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
Pam: Why do you need more gas?
Michael: Well, I'm writing a message.
Pam: Is it a good message or a bad message?
Michael: I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
Pam: Are you proposing!?
Michael: Maybe.
Pam: Wow.
Michael: Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
Pam: Yea. Yea no problem. [runs away]
Michael: Pam.
Pam: Yep.
Micahel: Could you light this please?
Pam: Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible. 
Michael: I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
Pam: This is terrible.
Michael: No, this is romantic.
Pam: You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
 
Ryan: Free sample?
 
Ryan: My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
 
Dwight: You got this kosher certified?
Ryan: No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
Dwight: Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
Ryan: Thank you. Whatcha got there?
Dwight: Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco. 
 
Dwight: things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
 
Dwight: Jim, put those away.
Jim: [pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
Dwight: just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
Jim: They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
 
Pam: Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.
Michael: Why?
Pam: You called the meeting I don't..
Michael: I did?
 
Michael: Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
Pam: Michael. 
Michael: Yes.
Pam: We are a family.
Michael: I could not have agreed with you more.
Pam: And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
Michael: Yes. Thank you.
Pam: So about this proposal thing...
Michael: No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
Pam: Michael, she's perfect for you.
Oscar: She's the one.
Jim: She's amazing. This is very exciting.
Pam: So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
Michael: I had a great idea until you ruined it.
Oscar: Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
 
Andy: [playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
Kevin: Nice.
Andy: And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
Kevin: No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Andy: Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
Darryl: And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
Andy: Oooh.
Darryl: Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
Kevin: no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
Darryl: It was in the box.
Andy: Well played.
Darryl: Thank you.
Andy: We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
Kevin: No but that's not fair.
Andy: Well that's Dallas.
Darryl: Dallas indeed.
 
Oscar: What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
 
Ryan: My mom also makes the best salsa.
 
Holly: This is your moms old stuff?
Phyllis: Yeah mostly.
Holly: How's she doing?
Phyllis: It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
Holly: How do you know when its time?
Phyllis: Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
Holly: Let me see.
 
Pam: Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
Ryan: Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Michael: How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
Jim: That's a guarantee.
Michael: It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
Jim: Don't think you need the corpse then.
Michael: Heres the ring.
Pam: Holy s*** is that real?
Michael: Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
Oscar: No. [shakes head back and forth]
Michael: Is she not going to like that?
Pam: No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
Oscar: Where was that.
Jim: At a gas station. [oscar laughs]
Michael: At a gas station? 
Jim: Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Michael: That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
Pam: No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
Michael: Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
Jim: Totally reasonable. 
Michael: I just... it's terrifying.
Pam: She's not gonna say no.
Michael: I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
Jim: Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Pam: You were scared?
Jim: Yeah... it.s scary.
 
Michael: Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'
Holly: Look I need to talk to you.
Michael: Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
Holly: I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
Michael: Oh ok. For how long?
Holly: I don't know.
Michael: Is he alright?
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: You ok?
Holly: Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
Michael: Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
Holly: And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
Michael: Ok.
Holly: And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
Michael: No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
 
Holly: Uh, what?
 
Michael: No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
 
Kevin: Hey guys it's my turn.
Andy: You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
Kevin: Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
Darryl: I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
Kevin: This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
Darryl: Yeah where is it?
Kevin: Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
 
Kevin: And that is Dallas. [shows money]
 
Ryan: Nice.
Jim: Not bad right. [swinging golf club]
Ryan: Can't really tell the...
Jim: [to Dwight] Nice.
Dwight: I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the?
Jim: Oh my God.
Dwight: That... that's impossible.
Jim: It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
Dwight: All right, I'll take them.
Jim: They're probably worthless.
Dwight: Probably. [walks away with beans]
Jim: Leave the telescope.
 
Dwight: I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
 
Michael: Hey, how'd we do?
Holly: 13 dollars. 
Michael: That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
Holly: Listen about earlier ...
Michael: No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
Holly: It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
Michael: Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
 
Michael: So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
Holly: Why?
Michael: This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
 
Michael: This is where we first kissed.
Holly: I remember.
Michael: And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
Holly: Michael.. [they both laugh]
 
Michael: Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes. 
Holly: Yes.
Michael: In-grown hair. 
 
Michael: Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
Holly: Mh hmm.
Michael: We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
Holly: Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
Michael: And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
 
Michael: And over here..
Holly: What happened here?
Michael: Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]
Holly: Nice
Michael: Let's go in here.
 
Holly: [everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
Michael: This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
Jim: Holly, will you marry me?
Holly: No.
Stanley: Marry me Holly.
Holly: No.
Michael: That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
Oscar: Will you marry me?
Holly: No.
Michael: That marriage would be a sham.
Gabe: Will you marry me?
Holly: No.
Michael: Easy no.
Angela: Will you marry me?
Holly: No.
Michael: That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
Ryan: Will you marry me Holly?
Holly: No.
Michael: Only one that I was kind of worried about.
Michael: [the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
Holly: Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
Kevin: That's awesome!
Pam: Congratulations!
Jim: Congratulations!
Michael: Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
Kevin: All of us?
Michael: Yep.
Jim: Wait, what?
Michael: Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.

Michael: Kahlua Sombrero, please.
Waiter: All right, so just you tonight?
Michael: Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
Deangelo: I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.
Michael: Oh, really?
Deangelo: To begginings and endings. 
Michael: And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
Deangelo: The moms and the troops.
Michael: Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday. 
Deangelo: [laughs] I won't... I don't know her.
Michael: I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
Deangelo: Colorado! The sunshine state.
Michael: Yep. Don't mess with Colorado. 
Deangelo: Doing some skiing? 
Michael: No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
Deangelo: Well that's just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.
Michael: You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
Deangelo: Try it once, you're hooked. That's my guess.
Michael: That's what I've heard.
Deangelo: I'm an olympics nut.
Michael: Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
Deangelo/Michael: [in unison] Summer!
Deangelo: [holds out fist] Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you...
 
Deangelo: You know, it's funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going.
Michael: Really? What happened?
Deangelo: You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?
Michael: Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Deangelo: That's the way it goes.
Michael: Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo's phone vibrates]
Deangelo: Excuse me. Hello? You running late?
Michael: No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar. 
Deangelo: I'm at the bar too.
Michael: You are? What bar?
Deangelo: I'm at the bar. The bar that's located in the lobby of the hotel.
Michael: I... do not see you.
Deangelo: How long have you...
Michael: I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
Deangelo: Ok, me too.
Deangelo/Michael: [looking up from phones in unison] Sorry...
Michael: What're you wearing?
Deangelo: I am wearing a grey suit, red tie.
Michael: Are we both at the right place?
Deangelo: Which place?
Michael: I hear your voice.
Deangelo: I hear your voice, I see your lips moving.
Michael: I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.
Deangelo: Deangelo Vickers.
Michael: Wow... that is insane! [laughter] 
Deangelo: That is insane, that is the right term. Let's get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend.
 
Michael: [entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?
Deangelo: I am ready. 
Michael: Alright! Here we go! 
 
Michael: This is it. What do you think?
Deangelo: Oh, she'll do. She'll do just fine.
 
Deangelo: I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune...
Michael: [pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]
Deangelo: Did that? Did that just happen?! [runs after Michael] We should.. we should write a movie or something! I'm serious!
 
Oscar: Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise. 
 
Kevin: [wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
 
Michael: Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers! 
Deangelo: [blinds roll down, Deangelo waving] 
Michael: Come on out! 
Deangelo: Hello! [opens door] How are you sir?
Michael: I am well, sir, how are you?
Deangelo: Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-
 
Dwight: Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
 
Kelly: [drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Deangelo: [picks up paper] I'll help you.
Kelly: Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]
Deangelo: Hello!
Kelly: Have we met before? 
Deangelo: No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before.
Kelly: Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
Deangelo: [offers Kelly the papers as she walks away]
 
Kelly: And that is what you call a meet cute.
 
Michael: And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!
Darryl: Kind of embarassing.
Angela: Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
Michael: I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
Deangelo: Oh. [chuckles] That was... let's see, where's my replacement? Where's the guy I'm replacing? Why don't I look to the left? He's sitting right there! [office laughs]
Michael: Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
Deangelo: [silences Michael]
Andy: That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
Deangelo: [laughs] Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!
 
Andy: I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
 
Michael: This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
Pam: Well, it wasn't an affair.
Michael: Yes it was.
Pam: But, no, but we are a family.
Jim: [points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
Pam: Cecelia.
Deangelo: Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own.
Pam: Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]
 
Pam: Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Jim: Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies. 
 
Dwight: Thanks for meeting me.
Michael: Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
Dwight: There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
Michael: You know me very well, Dwight.
Dwight: That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy. 
Michael: Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
Dwight: I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
 
Meredith: That apple looks delic!
Deangelo: I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200. [laughter]
Stanley: Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter] 
Michael: So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
Darryl: It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
 
Darryl: It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
 
Darryl: I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems. 
Deangelo: Here's the great thing about the southwest; there's so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen. 
Kevin: Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Angela: Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics? 
Deangelo: I did not.
Angela: Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
Deangelo: Sounds very interesting, thank you.
 
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Deangelo: Why do you use your name when you use the phone?
Erin: Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
Deangelo: Try it without using your name.
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Deangelo: Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you?
Erin: Oh, assist.
Michael: I sorta like the old way.
Deangelo: I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I've got to start doing some managing at some point.
Michael: I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
Deangelo: And it really isn't. 
Michael: Is that good?
Erin: Yeah, ok, good.
Deangelo: Well, I'd like to change it, actually.
Michael: Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
Erin: What do you think?
Deangelo: I think a change would be nice.
Michael: You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings]
Denagelo: [whispering] Change it.
Erin: [picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
 
Deangelo: Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can't even look at you.
Andy: Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter]
Erin: Deangelo, did you order a barber?
Deangelo: Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can't wait to hear the punchline.
Darryl: Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
Andy: I... don't know. Help me.
 
Ryan: [a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
Phyllis: Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
Deangelo: I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.
Michael: [to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
Deangelo: Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close.
Michael: And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael's face, none on the neck] 
Deangelo: Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn't it?
Michael: It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
Oscar: You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
Deangelo: Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.
Michael: Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... [Erin shaves Michael] god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
Deangelo: Ok, then, powwows then, fine.
Michael: That's-
Pam: Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
Jim: Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Pam: Da-das.
Jim: And what happens here is-
Deangelo: You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I'm sorry.
Jim: We were... I think she was just trying to-
Deangelo: No, no, no, I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?
Michael: You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Oscar: Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Michael: Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
Erin: Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Michael: Don't shave my lips.
 
Deangelo: [Andy walks into room] What's up?
Andy: I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...
 
Andy: I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
 
Andy: ...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
Deangelo: Let's not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy.
Andy: [leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]
Deangelo: [laughter] Now that's funny! That's funny! You walk much?
Andy: Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]
 
Deangelo: Little click...
Erin: [pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
Deangelo: Thank you. That's my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.
Stanley: Need a hand?
Deangelo: Oh, that'd be great, thank you Stanley!
Michael: You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
Ryan: [holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
Michael: I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
Darryl: So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
Deangelo: Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid.
Kevin: Interesting.
 
Michael: Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.
 
Darryl's sister: [holds out cowboy boots for Darryl]
Darryl: Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
Darryl's sister: Hey, hey, hey! [holds up set of pistols in holsters]
Darryl: No, I'm good. Keep them.
 
Deangelo: Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?
Andy: [mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]
Deangelo: [laughs] Drink some soap!
Andy: [drinks hand soap]
Deangelo: [laughter and applause]
 
Andy: I guess this is my life now.
 
Dwight: How do I become a manger at Sabre?
Gabe: First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
Dwight: I left a message at corporate.
Gabe: Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
Dwight: Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
Gabe: What recommendation?
Dwight: From when he recommended me to replace him.
Gabe: ...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
 
Deangelo: Best whale watching: easily the west coast. If you're going whale watching on the East Coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called "West Coast Whales'. [laughter] Because you're not gonna see them-
Michael: [interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
Kevin: Awesome!
Phyllis: Mmm, whatcha got?
Michael: PB and J, my mom's recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis]
Angela: Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
Deangelo: I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.
Stanley: What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Michael: I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin's open mouth]
Oscar: Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut? 
Michael: What?
Deangelo: Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.
Jim: Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
Deangelo: No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.
Michael: Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch]
Deangelo: [uses book to stop the sandwitch's flight] You're getting nut particles all in the air!
Michael: No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
Deangelo: [steps into conference room] Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now. 
Michael: No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.
Oscar: Michael, This is insane.
Michael: No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No. 
Jim: Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Michael: Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
Dwight: Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room. 
Deangelo: [walks out] Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or...?
Michael: I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
Deangelo: Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving. [extents hands for hug] Bring it in, come on. [Michael doesn't accept hug] Ok. [walks back]
Michael: Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good?
Deangelo: I... I'm adequete. I'm half as good as you.
Michael: No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
Deangelo: Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You've worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It's Lake Havasu time!
Micahel: Guess I've been working so hard I forgot what it's like to be hardly working.
Deangelo: Ok. What is the Native American girl's name?
Michael: You'll figure it out.
 
Jim: Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
Deangelo: That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.
Jim: Thank you very much.
 
Pam: See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
Jim: We're back in! Right?
 
Deangelo: I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled 'Babys I Don't Care About.'

Michael: It is six a.m. [DeAngelo yawns] and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
DeAngelo: Yes, and this happens every...?
Michael: Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. [DeAngelo laughs]
DeAngelo: Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition.
Michael: Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
 
Michael: [arriving at the first house] Alright let's go! [DeAngelo runs in the wrong direction] This way, this way! [Michael knocks on the door]
DeAngelo: Thanks.
Michael: Surprise!
DeAngelo: Congratulations!
Jim: Yep, okay...
Michael: You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
Jim: Okay.
Michael: [holds up a camera and DeAngelo meows] Here we go! Have Pam come down.
Jim: No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
Pam: What's going on?
Jim: Stay in bed!
 
Michael: [next house] Congratulations!
Stanley: Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
Michael: We got it.
DeAngelo: Uh, leave it at the door or...?
Michael: Yeah that's fine.
 
Michael: [next house] Hey Toby! You suck! [throwing eggs at his house]
DeAngelo: Is this an employee of ours?
Michael: [giggles] Go go go go go go!
 
Michael: [arriving at a dumpy looking, unkempt house] I've never seen this place in the daylight. 
DeAngelo: It reminds me of Katrina.
Michael: Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]
Meredith: I'm so busted! Walk of shame!
DeAngelo: Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?
Meredith: Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
Michael: Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
Meredith: No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
DeAngelo: [whispers] I'm not going in there.
Michael: [quietly shuts the door] Go.
 
Michael: [walking into the office] Good morning Erin.
Erin: Oh hey, didn't see you.
Michael: You have big plans for tonight?
Erin: I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
Michael: You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.
 
Michael: The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
 
Michael: Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
Dwight: Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Michael: Black tie optional.
Dwight: Every day is black tie optional!
Michael: A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
Kevin: Nice! [rest of the office looks excited]
Phyllis: I love their breadsticks!
Pam: Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
Ryan: I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Pam: Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
Ryan: I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
Pam: You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his "Jim face"]
Michael: Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
Ryan: Yeah that's great.
Michael: So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]
 
Dwight: Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
 
DeAngelo: Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
Michael: Think of it as part of your training.
DeAngelo: Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay...
Michael: [smiling] Okay, well we'll work on it.
DeAngelo: [whispers to Michael] Michael, I'm very, very bad.
Michael: You are doing it.
 
Michael: [all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
Kevin: Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Michael: Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
DeAngelo: That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-
Michael: [cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
DeAngelo: This did not happen.
Michael: Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?
Ryan: Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Michael: [very excited] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny.
DeAngelo: Uhhh, you sir! [points to Jim] Are we having fun tonight?
Jim: Having a great time.
DeAngelo: Oh good!
Jim: Thanks, yeah.
DeAngelo: Where were you on September 11th?
Michael: No! God! [Jim looks at him oddly]
DeAngelo: This is so weird! If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance... I-I fall apart. Obviously.
Andy: Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
Michael: No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
Jim: Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Michael: Jim, please no loopholes.
Darryl: Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
Michael: This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
 
DeAngelo: [laying down, Michael is sitting on DeAngelo's stomach bouncing up and down in Michael's office] Me mo. Me mo.
Michael: Good. Good. Good!
DeAngelo: Meee Mo, Mee!
Michael: Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
DeAngelo: When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.
Michael: [getting off his stomach] Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. [picking up a portable tape player] Let's try this. Put these on. [DeAngelo puts the headphones in] I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- [DeAngelo winces] That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, [gives him a card] and make it sound perfect.
DeAngelo: THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! [Jim comes and closes the door]
Michael: Say it with an accent!
DeAngelo: [bad Australian accent attempt] THE DUNDIES!
Michael: [also in a poor Australian accent] The Dundies!
DeAngelo: THE DUNDIES!
 
Jim: [Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
Pam: Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?
Erin: Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
Jim: Who's gonna see us?
Erin: [desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
Jim: Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Erin: Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
Pam: What's wrong?
Erin: I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Pam: Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Erin: I, really don't like spending time with him.
Pam: Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
Jim: I think I'm gonna go.
Pam: What?
Jim: I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Erin: Thank you Jim.
 
Jim: I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
 
Erin: I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
Pam: Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
 
Dwight: [standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
Kevin: [walks in] Hi!
Dwight: Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
Erin: DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.
DeAngelo: Hello?
"Jo": [Michael dressed as Jo Bennett, using a bad Southern accent] DeAngelo! We're in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain't got no host!
DeAngelo: Oh no!
"Jo": Luckily I have someone for you!
DeAngelo: Billy Crystal?
"Jo": Better.
DeAngelo: Neil Patrick Harris?
"Jo": He's in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi! [everyone in the audience is laughing]
DeAngelo: Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, [Russel Brand impression] Get Him to the Dundies!
DeAngelo: [in the office near the accountants] Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?
"Angela": [Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Audience: [laughing]
DeAngelo: Mmhmm.
Angela: Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
Oscar: [laughing]
Oscar: Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
DeAngelo: Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?
"Jim": [Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Jim: [shaking head at the camera]
DeAngelo: No one is listening to me! And I'm running out of time!
"Phyllis": [Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
DeAngelo: Maybe I just need to look into my heart. [in the bathroom in front of the mirror] DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. [his reflection in the mirror turns around to reveal that it is Michael]
Michael: I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
 
Oscar: The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
 
Dwight: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
 
Michael: [in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!
DeAngelo: Go do it by yourself, get Ryan.
Michael: No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
DeAngelo: This was not, part of the job description!
Michael: Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
DeAngelo: Who am I doing this for?
Michael: [slaps him] You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It's showtime. Get out there. 
DeAngelo: I can't. [Michael slaps him again]
Michael: Say it.
DeAngelo: Stop, hitting me.
Michael: You can do it, just say it.
DeAngelo: Hit me again. [Michael slaps him once more]
Michael: Now hit me. [DeAngelo slaps him] One, two, three.
Together: It's showtime.
Michael: Alright, here we go.
 
Michael: Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs]
DeAngelo: Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys?
Jim: Nope, go back to the script.
Michael: There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]
Jim: Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Michael: Well done.
Jim: I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Michael : Alright. [all applaud Jim]
Pam: You didn't think to mention me huh?
Jim: Didn't I?
Michael: Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
Meredith: [jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
Dwight: Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
Jim: I gotta go do this.
Pam: [annoyed] Why?
Dwight: Big smiles folks! There they are. 
Michael: Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn't be here tonight...
 
Ryan: How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
 
Michael: Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. [Stanley looks angry] But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! [Stanley slowly walks over, angry] Come on up here you sick bastard.
 
Phyllis: I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
 
DeAngelo: They say he's going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. [realizing he wasn't supposed to read that directly off the cue card, speaks quietly] No, I hate this, I hate it so much. [loud again] Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie. [people clap as Dwight takes the microphone, he is obviously unenthused] Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. [Creed nods] This is for you trashcan! [walks off and throws the Dundie into the trashcan]
Manager: [the manager of Louie Volpies approaches a giggling Kevin, who is coloring with crayons on the tablecloth] Who gave you those crayons?
Kevin: I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Manager: This is a cloth tablecloth! You can't color on it!
Kevin: Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
Michael: You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? [manager looks up, angrily at Michael] Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! [Erin looks thrilled and walks up to the stage]
Meredith: That is bull! [throws her Dundie]
Erin: Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
Gabe: What?
Erin: I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
Gabe: [stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]
Michael: [escorts Erin off stage] There you go.
Darryl: Damn that was cold.
Michael: It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]
Audience: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
DeAngelo: Hold on, hold on one second. [puts on the headphones and turns the volume up all the way] I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN'S ROOM!
Manager: Okay, okay. [trying to stop him from offending other people in his restaurant]
DeAngelo: THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING...
Michael: [stopping Manager] DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
DeAngelo: This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It's so much lighter!
Michael: Okay, we're done! That's it.
DeAngelo: Michael, are we?!
Michael: We're done. We're done!
 
Michael: [Outside of the restaurant, obviously sad] So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
Pam: Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
Michael: What?
DeAngelo: I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
Michael: No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
Pam: Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
Michael: So what you're saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I've fallen and I can't get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
Jim: I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
Michael: That got a big laugh.
Jim: That did. Pretty huge laugh.
Michael: [to Stanley, who is cracking up again] You were laughing right?
Stanley: I was.
 
DeAngelo: [with Dwight and Michael outside Michael's car] You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.
Michael: We're really close.
DeAngelo: I can just run over to the gas station.
Dwight: We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
Michael: That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
DeAngelo: Okay, fine I'll hold it.
Michael: [in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well. 
Dwight: I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
Michael: Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
Dwight: Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
DeAngelo: [as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.
Michael: What is your problem?!
Dwight: I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Michael: Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
Dwight: And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
DeAngelo: [very uncomfortable] Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. [gets out and slams the door]
Michael: He is in an all-out sprint.
 
Michael: [in conference room] Here... [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]
Andy: A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
Michael: Oh, okay. [nods to him]
Andy: I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
Darryl: [starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Michael: Oh my God, something's happening.
Andy: [singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
All: Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's how many minutes, that you've worked here.
Pam: In costumes!
Jim: And impressions!
Toby: In meetings.
Erin and Kelly: And cups of coffee.
Kevin: For birthdays!
Stanley: More meetings and-
Women: E-Mail forms you made us read.
All: Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's like watching Die Hard, eighty thousand times!
Meredith: You hit me with your car!
Ryan: You helped me get off drugs!
Creed: I watch you when you sleep.
Oscar: I forgive you for kissing me!
All: Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call.
Kelly and Erin: Call, text or e-mail, or call.
DeAngelo: [falsetto] Measure your life in love!
All: Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call.
 
Michael: [choked up] Yeah, okay. [pauses, then takes a deep breath] Well this is gonna hurt like a mother[bleep].
 
DeAngelo: [recall to Dundies at Louie Volpies] Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean!
Michael: No it's not.
Oscar: [Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
Jim: You gotta play along man.
Oscar: Come on Toby.
Michael: Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic]
Toby: I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]

Michael: [sitting on the roof of the office building] Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.
Dwight: [walking up] Michael?
Michael: Yes?
Dwight: I've got a treat for you!
Michael: Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
Dwight: Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
Michael: [Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
Dwight: [angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
Michael: Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
Dwight: What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Michael: I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Dwight: Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Michael: Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
Dwight: Great idea.
Michael: ...in order to feed the bears.
Dwight: Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Michael: How do you mean?
Dwight: Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
Michael: Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
Dwight: Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Michael: Okay.
 
DeAngelo: [with Michael in his office] You're not gonna take all these toys are you?
Michael: Hm?
DeAngelo: I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.
Michael: Well I have interviews.
DeAngelo: That's nice. [reaches and a grabs a toy truck] How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. [Michael gives an obviously fake smile] You okay?
Michael: Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
DeAngelo: You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.
Michael: Oh you don't, that's-
DeAngelo: I will be in the break room.
Michael: That sounds good. Thank you.
 
DeAngelo: Dead man walking.
 
Michael: Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
 
Gabe: [sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
Andy: Hey!
Gabe: I'm your boss!
Andy: Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
Gabe: No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
Andy: Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
Gabe: No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
Andy: [weak] Hi Tuna.
 
Jim: So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
 
Phyllis: [in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
Angela: Please.
Pam: What's wrong with cupcakes?
Angela: Everything.
Michael: [walking in] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Pam: Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
 
Pam: We thought.
Angela: It's an experiment.
Phyllis: The three of us have all been chairmen before.
Pam: So this is the dream team.
Meredith: [walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
Angela: The dream team... and Meredith.
 
Meredith: [to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
Michael: Mmm!
Phyllis: Yeah that was a surprise...
Michael: You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
Pam: [surprised] Okay.
Michael: Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
Pam: Should we get toppings?
Michael: What do you like Pam?
Pam: [confused] What?
Michael: What kind of toppings would you like?
Pam: Hot fudge?
Michael: Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael's behavior]
 
Michael: [holding up his "World's Best Boss Mug"] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.
 
Michael: [pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
Phyllis: Please Michael.
Michael: When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute. [Phyllis looks relieved] And she still is.
 
Phyllis: I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
 
Phyllis: [holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
Michael: Ahh.
Phyllis: It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
Michael: [hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]
Phyllis: It's cute. [plays with it]
Michael: Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
Stanley: Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
Michael: Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]
Andy: Wow.
Stanley: [angry] Yeah wow!
Andy: You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
Michael: But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
Phyllis: What does that even mean?
Michael: You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
Andy: I'm gonna lose 'em.
Michael: You're not gonna lose them.
Andy: I promise you that I will.
Michael: Just do your best! I have faith in you.
Stanley: [as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
Andy: No.
Phyllis: [to Dwight] Do you believe that?!
 
Dwight: I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
 
DeAngelo: I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. [winks]
 
Michael: Kevin, I have something for you.
Kevin: Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Michael: You know who that is?
Kevin: Oh...
Michael: [rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
Kevin: Better...
Michael: Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
Kevin: But...
Michael: You will find love.
Kevin: Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
Michael: Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. [moving on] Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
Andy: I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
Michael: [quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]
Oscar: Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
 
Michael: [laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
 
Michael: Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
Angela: It was just you...
Michael: How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
Oscar: State Senator.
Michael: Mmhmm, bravo!
Oscar: Brava!
Angela: You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Michael: Sure!
Angela: Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Michael: Who's that? Who's that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures]
Angela: Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
Michael: I guess this could be the one, huh?
Angela: Yeah. [Oscar shakes his head no]
 
Andy: [walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
DeAngelo: [hurriedly, while hiding the chocolate covered chicken] Hey!
Andy: I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
DeAngelo: Let's rip it up homes. [smacks top of the door frame with his hand, leaving a chocolate hand outline]
 
Gabe: [Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch. 
 
Oscar: [Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
Michael: My last pay check?
Oscar: You have an address yet in Colorado?
Michael: No.
Oscar: What town do Holly's parents live in?
Michael: I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
Kevin: Sounds beautiful!
 
Pam: [Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
Kevin: I'm going to!
Jim: [to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Michael: Nah, I'm almost done.
Jim: You sure?
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
Kevin: Finally! That old shredder sucked.
Pam: It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
Kevin: Yeah, it won't shred magazines.
Pam: It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
Kevin: I know...
Jim: Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Kevin: No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
Pam: I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
 
Michael: [crying] I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. [picks World's Best Boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk] I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. [dials on his phone]
Holly: [on phone] Hello there!
Michael: Hi. What is the name of our town?
Holly: Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
Michael: No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
Holly: [Yoda voice] Oh you mean this?
Michael: [laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!
Holly: [deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
Michael: [laughing] Ohh, I miss you.
Holly: Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Michael: Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
Holly: I love you too.
Michael: [hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them.
 
Toby: Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
Michael: [grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay.
Toby: [smiling] Okay.
Michael: [walks over to Kelly] Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
Kelly: [doing make up and irritated] What?!
Michael: If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
Kelly: Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
 
Michael: [in Ryan's office, which is illuminated blue] She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
Ryan: Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
Michael: Yeah.
Ryan: This is... totally unnecessary.
Michael: You're not prone to seizures?
Ryan: No.
 
Pam: [in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
Meredith: [quickly] Erotic.
Angela: See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
Phyllis: Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
Meredith: I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
Angela: Good God...
Meredith: They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
Pam: I don't, I don't think we sh-
Meredith: I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
Pam: [stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
Phyllis: As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
Pam: You know what, I think we should get some other input.
Kelly: I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
Phyllis: Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
Angela: No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker. 
 
Michael: [sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.
Pam: Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
Michael: [disappointed] Okay... [Jim is confused]
 
Erin: [walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
Gabe: I need to talk to you!
Erin: You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
abe: Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Erin: Hey Creed.
Creed: Not cool man. [walks out]
Erin: I really think you should leave.
Gabe: Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
Erin: Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Gabe: Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
Erin: Gabe!
Gabe: Okay... [walks out embarrassed]
 
Toby: [on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
Rory: I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him.
Toby: Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
Rory: Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves.
Toby: Well, no. He hates jams.
 
Michael: [walking into Darryl's office] Darryl!
Darryl: Hey.
Michael: I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. [hands him a thin black folder] Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
Darryl: That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
Michael: Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
Darryl: No. Can't let you do that Mike.
Michael: No problem. Worth a try.
 
Michael: [in warehouse] Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
Warehouse Guy: No.
Michael: [picks up a basketball and dribbles it away from the basket] Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip. [throws the ball behind him and misses the basket, tries and misses several more times]
 
DeAngelo: [in car with Andy] okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? [Andy stares blankly] Hmm?
Andy: I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
DeAngelo: That's stupid. [laughing. Nervously, Andy laughs with him]
Andy: [joking] What do I know?
DeAngelo: [still laughing] What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let's get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?
Andy: [confused] Yeah.
DeAngelo: Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?
Andy: Yeah!
DeAngelo: 'Cause if you do now's the time.
Andy: [going for it] Alright.
DeAngelo: Not while I'm driving.
 
Michael: [still trying the backwards basket] Catch you guys- [forklift drives in front of the camera] Catch you guys on the filippity flip. [misses and picks it up again] Flippity flip! [misses again and grabs it back] Flippity flip! [makes it in, gets excited] Really? [composes himself] Okay, see ya guys! [walks away, containing his self-pleasure]
 
DeAngelo: [at the animal shelter with Andy] You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?
Andy: No. I don't.
DeAngelo: [hands Andy a dog] I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me.
Andy: Awwhh, wow.
DeAngelo: Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! [takes the dog from a confused Andy] Yeah! Again.
Andy: Oh, okay...
DeAngelo: Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again! [Andy nods modestly] You hear me?! [Andy nods again] You feel that energy?
Andy: Mmhmmm.
DeAgnelo: Wooo! Yeah! [parades in circles with the dog, pretends to whack Andy with it] [giving it to Andy] Okay, again.
 
Erin: I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
Michael: Kevin?
Erin: Andy.
Michael: Ahhhh...
Erin: I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
Michael: Maybe neither.
Erin: I'm not attracted to Kevin. 
Michael: Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
Erin: [nods] Extension 147.
Michael: N-
Erin: I know.
Michael: Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]
 
Phyllis: [on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
Michael: Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
Phyllis: No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
Michael: Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
Phyllis: Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Michael: Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]
 
Dwight: This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
 
Dwight: [opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
 
Michael: [in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]
 
DeAngelo: [giving his and Andy's pitch to a client] I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. [Andy looks awkward] But I can say this: He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say: go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, [Andy looks hopeful] Andy's not your guy. [Andy deflates] You ever play Russian Roulette? [scoffs] Time to spin the chamber horse. By signing up for another year. [hands the client a folder he needs signed for another year's contract]
 
Jim: [Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Michael: You should see the other guy.
Dwight: [smiles knowingly]
Michael: [looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam?
Jim: Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
Michael: But it is already three o'clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
 
Pam: [walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
 
Michael: [in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
 
Michael: Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
 
Michael: [Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here.
Gabe: [sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
Michael: No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]
 
DeAngelo: [walking out the client's room with Andy] That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.
Andy: Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
DeAngelo: [grumbles] Okay whatever.
Andy: [walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
Client: Keep talking.
 
DeAngelo: [on his phone waiting for Andy, next to their car] Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. [hangs up] You'll never guess, we did it!
Andy: [laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!
DeAngelo: We did it!
 
Michael: [standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
 
Stanley: Yes, what is this about?
Michael: What is this meeting about?
Stanley: Mmhmmm.
Michael: Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
Phyllis: They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Michael: [cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
Stanley: Is that it?
Michael: Umm, hmm?
Stanley: Is that it?
Michael: [the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much! 
Jim: Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Michael: Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out!
Jim: [brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
Michael: [sad] Ohh...
Jim: What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
Michael: [holding back tears] Okay...
Jim: You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Michael: Maybe.
Jim: Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Michael: Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
Jim: Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
Michael: [pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...
Jim: You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
Michael: Oh, okay.
Jim: And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
Michael: [hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.
Jim: Alright.
Michael: Alright.
Jim: Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Michael: I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
Jim: [shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
Michael: I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
Jim: [chuckles] You got it.
Michael: Okay... [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.
Phyllis: Oh no, they're still not done. 
Michael: No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]
Creed: [drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
Michael: Later guys. [leaves the office]
 
Michael: Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
 
Michael: [putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]
 
Pam: [watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
 
DeAngelo: [all are in the conference room for Michael's party. Michael isn't there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing? [chucks it into the trashcan] Come on DeAngelo! [DeAngelo tries to lick the cake, everybody yells no]
Dwight: [to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods] 

Deangelo: So, coasting time is officially over. Big changes are comin', and they're comin' fast. If you don't like 'em, this is called a door. You can walk right through it. Alright. I'm not here to be your friend. I like my life outside of this place. I live to leave at 5. Change number one: Darryl. Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night. Full ride. Deal with it.
Darryl: Seriously?
Deangelo: Stone cold seriously.
 
Deangelo: They are trying to figure me out. And I don't like it. Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I want to hear, I'm not gonna care.
 
Deangelo: Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair.
Toby: Thanks.
Deangelo: Don't thank me! Hey, don't thank me, guy! Okay? And I don't care if you like it.
Oscar: These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
Deangelo: I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream. You either like it or you don't. [Andy nods] That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays. Alright? Clear? Any questions?
Kevin: This all sounds great to me. [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think.
Deangelo: That is a s-- astute observation, Kevin.
 
Deangelo: Kev's got me pegged. [chuckles]
 
Deangelo: It blows away Vermont in the fall.
Darryl: Snap, for real?
Pam: Good morning, Deangelo.
Deangelo: Hold on.
Pam: Okay.
Deangelo: [continuing to talk to Darryl] And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring.
Pam: Because of the flowers.
Deangelo: No. Because the entire state smells like Earth.
Pam: Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
Deangelo: Yes, Pam.
Pam: Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. [looking at resume] She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
Deangelo: Put it with the rest.
Pam: Okay.
 
Deangelo: [entering his office] Hey dudes!
Jim: Hey!
Andy: Hey!
Pam: Oh my God, he hates me!
Jim: No he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Pam: I know.
Jim: Every time there's a silence, your brain's like "Heh-heh-huh-huh" [imitating crying].
Pam: Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
Jim: Careful. There is no inner circle.
 
Andy: Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah.
 
Jim: There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
 
Kevin: Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, Ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle! [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
 
Deangelo: [holding two cups of coffee] There he is! Got ya coffee. [offers cup to Dwight]
Dwight: Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you. [throws cup in the garbage]
Deangelo: Not a coffee guy, I take it.
Dwight: It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
Deangelo: Listen. I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the People" on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want.
Dwight: I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
 
Deangelo: No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight.
 
Deangelo: Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh? What do you guys say? 
Kevin: Yes!
Deangelo: Right! Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients.
Kevin: Yeah, I say we just go for it! 
Deangelo: [shoots mini basketball at hoop on office door, misses badly] Is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knockoff? 
Jim: That's Toys R Us, I think.
Deangelo: No, that's definitely a knockoff. You can feel the center of gravity's off. Feel that. [throws ball to Gabe] What do you think?
Gabe: [holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time.
Deangelo: [calling for the ball] Deangelo! [shoots and makes it] See what I did there? That's what you need to do. [makes shooting gesture] It's that little English. The British are coming.
Kevin: Yes.
Deangelo: Deangelo's open!
 
Deangelo: Hey Ry. Your department's killing it, baby. [puts arm around Ryan]
Ryan: Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
Deangelo: Keep it up.
 
Ryan: The problem with having "It" or "the X-factor" or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say.
 
Kelly: What?
Ryan: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Kelly: Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
Ryan: Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you.
Kelly: Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie.
Ryan: I'd die for you too.
Kelly: You really would?
Ryan: [hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
Kelly: Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
Deangelo: Woo. Glad he's not my boss. 
Ryan: [whispers to Kelly] You're the best. Thank you.
 
Deangelo: You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's.
Dwight: Congratulations on your one cousin. I have seventy. Each one better than the last.
Deangelo: You know what... straight up, why don't you like me?
Dwight: I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay?
Deangelo: Ohhhh no.
Dwight: What?
Deangelo: Okay? I'm gonna win you over.
Dwight: No you're not.
Deangelo: Yes I am.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Oh yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes. Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes [starts to run out of the break room] yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!
 
Jim: [looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative" and "assistant."
Darryl: The winner: under "Special Skills," Mr. Don Feiner put "Juggling." [laughter]
Deangelo: What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine. 
Jim: Seriously?
Deangelo: Oh yeah. I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet? 320?
Gabe: 320. Just freeballin' it.
Deangelo: It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? 17, 18 hundo?
Kevin: Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.
Gabe: Give or take. [Deangelo walks out]
 
Deangelo: Sorry gang. Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car. It's not.
Pam: Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
Andy: I gotcha covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls] Got some extra balls! [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them] Hey-hey-hey-ho!
Deangelo: Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments. You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued, why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls? [starts to play "Wake Me Up Inside" by Evanescence] Prepare... to go into the danger zone. [begins pretend juggling routine]
Pam: Oh wow, you weren't kidding.
Deangelo: No. Never. Can someone please throw me a fifth ball? If you dare! [Kevin pretends to throw ball] Incoming! And we're on! Remember, nothing's impossible! Phyllis, where's Phyllis?
Phyllis: [raises hand] Here.
Deangelo: Do you believe in me, Phyllis?
Phyllis: Yeah.
Deangelo: Because I believe in you.
Phyllis: Okay. 
Deangelo: [pretending to bounce balls off Phyllis at close range] Feel that connection? Don't move your head. Please. Thank you. Oh! Big hand for Phyllis! [clapping] That took a lot of guts! [finishes routine] Ho! I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something.
Kevin: Didn't drop a single ball!
 
Pam: [imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands.
Jim: What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Pam: What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?
Jim: He's good at his job. And I like working for him.
Angela: Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Andy: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the "Vagina Monologues" called the "Penis Apologies." So I know a thing or two.
Angela: Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin? What about Pam and Kelly? Also department heads. But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Andy: How could I not see it? You're so right.
Pam: [to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
Jim: And say what? "Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?"
Pam: Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
Jim: Mmm-hmm.
Andy: And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls?
 
Jim: Hey, you got a second?
Deangelo: Yeah, I got tons of time. This job's a joke.
 
Deangelo: So what's up?
Jim: Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
Darryl: [opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in. We meeting?
Deangelo: Yeah sure. Let's make it a meeting. [Darryl, Kevin, Gabe enter office]
Jim: If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
Deangelo: What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys!
Jim: I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand] Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads.
Deangelo: Uh-oh. Right?
Kevin: Hot!
Jim: Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
Darryl: Damn!
Jim: Whoa. Whoa. Wait.
Deangelo: Are you serious? Who feels this way?
Jim: Oh. Like nobody.
Gabe: Umm, Pam?
Jim: It was --
Gabe: Was it Pam?
Kevin: That sounds like Pam. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy. [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
Deangelo: Guys. Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea.
Jim: That's awesome.
Deangelo: Thank you.
 
Kelly: [on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again.
 
Ryan: [joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
Kelly: When Deangelo's around.
Ryan: And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
Kelly: All the time.
Ryan: All the time.
 
Deangelo: Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?
Erin: Absolutely.
Jim: Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
Deangelo: Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim. Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist. I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not. I am not a sexist. Raise your hand if you have a vagina. [Deangelo raises hand, Kelly and Pam sheepishly raise hands] Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina. [Deangelo raises other hand, along with rest of office] Yeah, yeah. Okay. Just about everyone. What about Deangelo's hand? Oh wow. He's got 'em both up. [Ryan raises both hands] Yeah. Uh huh. [others raise both hands] Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men. Okay? Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens.
Phyllis: I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
Deangelo: Dwight, what's your take?
Dwight: What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all.
Deangelo: Man, you're smart. [Erin arrives with new executive assistant] Oh, hey! Hi! Hello. Welcome. Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield. This is everyone.
Jordan: Hello.
Pam: So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office?
Jordan: No, Anthropology. We don't have this in that size, pretty lame.
Kelly: Lame? You worked at Anthropology?
Jordan: Yeah.
Kelly: That's like my dream job. How did you even get that job?
Jordan: Well, I umm -
Kelly: You chose this job over that job?
Ryan: Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Pam: So, umm, is this your first office job then?
Jordan: Yeah.
Deangelo: Yup.
Pam: Wow.
Deangelo: No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits.
 
Kevin: [heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming?
Jim: Oh yeah, did he text us?
Kevin: Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
Dwight: [holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
Pam: Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us.
Jim: He didn't text me. [Andy's phone chimes]
Andy: Yes! I'm in. 
Angela: Andy, what are you doing?
Andy: I'm going in, into the belly of the beast. Gonna infiltrate and change from within. [joins the group in Deangelo's office] What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]
Pam: [to Jim] Just go in. Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
 
Deangelo: Internally, for office use [Jim quietly enters Deangelo's office and sits down] where do we get our paper from? Do we go -
Jim: [to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Deangelo: [staring at Jim] Hey Jim.
Jim: Yeah.
Deangelo: Can I help you?
Jim: Nope. Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
 
Dwight: So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Jim: Well, there is no inner...circle.
 
Jordan: Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.
Dwight: Really? Anything.
Jordan: Do you need anything?
Dwight: Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
 
Andy: Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project. Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
 
Jim: So this is my life. Until I win the lottery [laughs]. Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
 
Pam: So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
 
Ryan: Hey! Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck! Okay? We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Deangelo: No one likes a money grubber.
Kelly: I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money. I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just can't do it. Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss. Okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
Deangelo: Ohh.
Ryan: Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
Kelly: No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically. Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding.
Deangelo: Is this true, Ryan?
Ryan: I did not see Rango.
Deangelo: Okay, I don't have time for this he said-she said.
Kelly: He's not saying anything!
Deangelo: It's too murky. I like Ryan. You seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way.
Kelly: That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
Ryan: [sighs] Oh, close call! Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
 
Pam: [knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey! It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
Gabe: Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
Deangelo: [chuckles] Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?
Gabe: [laughs] Total brain burp.
Deangelo: I'm no MJ. I can do his dunk. From the free throw line.
Kevin: Whoa.
Darryl: Daaamn! Mad respect for my brotha!
 
Darryl: The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
 
Pam: Okay, well it's just really loud.
Deangelo: Okay. We'll keep that in mind. Alright, ladies, back to the game.
Darryl: Do it!
Deangelo: Jim! Come on in.
Pam: You're back in.
Jim: You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
Deangelo: Yeah, we'll set that up one day.
Jim: Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
Deangelo: Yeah, I don't know.
Jim: Why not?
Deangelo: Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it.
Dwight: Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
Deangelo: Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper! [Dwight immediately gets up and walks out]
 
Dwight: Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership.
 
Jim: Alright, there you go.
Deangelo: Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line?
Jim: 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Deangelo: Nah, that's 15. Yeah.
Jim: Okay.
Deangelo: And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket?
Jordan: Seriously?
Deangelo: Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you. Best seat in the house.
Jordan: I don't, I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry.
Deangelo: Right. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it.
Kevin: Yes! Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
Deangelo: Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap? Angela?
Angela: No.
Deangelo: Oscar?
Oscar: No thank you.
Deangelo: Okay, Jimmy, this is for you. Show you that anything is possible.
Jim: Fantastic.
Deangelo: Alright?
Jim: Yup.
Deangelo: This is also for the troops. [backs up, bounces ball, starts running, jumps, lands in front of Kevin, jumps again, pulls himself up by the net, dunks ball, hangs on rim] Doctor is in! [hoop starts to fall] Ahhhh! [hoop crashes down on Deangelo]
 
Jim: [ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
 
Erin: [Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
Deangelo: [speaking gibberish] Tablab. 
Jim: Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please?
Erin: Who should I say is calling?
Jim: Erin.
Deangelo: [lots of gibberish] says to bartender [lots more gibberish] Droswip. Droswip.
Gabe: Droswip, yeah. I get it. Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom. 

Pam: We could get Deangelo flowers.
Dwight: No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
Phyllis: That's true.
Jim: All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Dwight: Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
Jim: Nope. Baskets have it.
 
Jim: So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high. 
 
Jim: [on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Dwight: [on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Jim: Wait...
Pam: What have you done?
Dwight [on phone]: Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now. 
Mose [on phone]: Aaaaahhhhh! 
 
Pam: Can't stay there all day.
Jim: I'm coming.
Pam: Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Jim: You'd slow me down.
 
Jim: Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Pam: Stop stalling! Come on. 
 
All: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation...
All but Oscar: ...under God...
All: ...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [Kevin finishes behind the rest of the group]
Angela: Amen.
Dwight: Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself. 
Erin: Ooh, about what?
Dwight: That's on a need-to-know basis.
Erin: I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
Dwight: [quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Jim: Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Dwight: Define foment.
Jim: You define foment.
Dwight: [clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
 
Dwight: [surprising Kelly] Aha!
Kelly: Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Dwight: Gotcha! Why are you late?
Kelly: It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Dwight: All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
 
Andy: In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
Erin: Oh! Darryl's funny. 
Andy: I know, right?
Gabe: Hey, Andy?
Andy: Yeah?
Gabe: Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Andy: Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
Gabe: Are you still in love with Erin?
Andy: What?
Gabe: Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
Andy: No, this is horrifying. 
Gabe: No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Andy: We're just friends, okay?
Gabe: Do you promise that?
Andy: Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
Gabe: No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
 
Dwight: [seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
Jim: Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know. 
Dwight: You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
Jim: Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Dwight: Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist. 
Jim: And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it. [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
 
Kevin: [inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
 
Stanley: [refills his coffee near a sign that reads "Honor System: $0.50" with a camera pointed at it]
 
Andy: Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
 
Dwight: I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
 
Kevin: [looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Creed: He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
Pam: You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Creed: No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch. 
Phyllis: He means the ice pack.
 
Erin: [on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
Gabe: I'm sorry. This can't wait.
Erin: He's just gonna call back.
Gabe: Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback] 
Erin: [quietly] What?
Gabe: Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail? 
Erin: Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages. 
Gabe: Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm. 
 
Erin: I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him. 
 
Jim: Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic. 
Dwight: Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue. 
Jim: And the desk.
Dwight: The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business. 
Jim: Okay. 
Dwight: Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
Jim: I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Dwight: Don't make me fire you.
Jim: You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers. 
Dwight: Don't make me pre-fire you.
Jim: You wouldn't dare. 
Dwight: Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired. 
Jim: [quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
Dwight: What?
 
Jim: If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well that's pretty premature to think," but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared. 
 
Dwight: How you doing, Jordan?
Jordan: I'm good.
Dwight: Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly. 
Jordan: Why are you telling me this?
Dwight: Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster. 
 
Dwight: [walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day. 
Pam: Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
Dwight: The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me. 
Andy: Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable. 
Dwight: The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster. 
Pam: Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Dwight: Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
Angela: Thank you.
Phyllis: You could put your cell phone in it instead. 
Dwight: Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Kevin: You could put a banana in it.
Dwight: Why would I put a banana in my holster? 
Kevin: In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later. 
Pam: Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo. 
Dwight: Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Erin: Andy!
Andy: Aah! Aah! It's so loud!
 
Oscar: My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that? 
Andy: [trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C. 
Meredith: Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Toby: Hey, what happened? 
Kelly: Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Dwight: No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun. 
Andy: [scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.
Oscar: I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Angela: Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD. 
Oscar: [buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall. 
Gabe: I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Dwight: Okay, why are you calling Jo?
Andy: I think I should go the hospital. 
Erin: I'll go with you.
Gabe: No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Darryl: I'll take him.
Andy: Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
Darryl: What's wrong with you?
Andy: It's my ear.
Darryl: Yeah. 
Andy: Okay, sorry. 
Toby: [excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before. 
Gabe: I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
Dwight: Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
 
Dwight: [enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
Stanley: We all saw you do it.
Dwight: Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Erin: Navy blue. Little red anchors. 
Dwight: I have no way of knowing if that's true. 
Toby: I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Dwight: Okay, really?
Toby: Would you consider this a terrorist incident? 
Ryan: I felt terrorized. 
Dwight: Come on. 
Toby: Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
Dwight: I just really, really think we should handle this internally. 
Ryan: Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Dwight: Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best. 
 
Andy: Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back. 
Dwight: There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Andy: Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Dwight: Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal. 
Andy: Yeah.
Phyllis: How's your hearing?
Andy: Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
 
Darryl: I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me. 
 
Kelly: Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition. 
Dwight: American Idol? What? No. 
Kelly: Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
Dwight: No. 
Kelly: [singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Dwight: Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition. 
Phyllis: Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day. 
Angela: Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
Kevin: Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Dwight: I put everything back in the vending machine. 
Kevin: Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit. 
Pam: You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
Dwight: Okay.
Jim: Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Dwight: Thank God.
Jim: Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
Dwight: What's jazz hands?
Jim: [quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
Dwight: Fine.
 
Dwight: [leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
Kevin: [after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
 
Jo: Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers. 
Dwight: Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
Jo: Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
Jim: Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Jo: Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs]
Dwight: [does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
 
Andy: We have to clean this up now!
Erin: She had so much -
Gabe: Hey, guys.
Erin: Hey.
Gabe: Hope I'm not interrupting anything. 
Andy: No! [Erin and Andy laugh]
Gabe: Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again? 
Andy: Uh...
Gabe: I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Andy: Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
Gabe: No, I was not.
Andy: And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
 
Dwight: Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
Kevin: Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage. 
Dwight: No, Kevin, come on. 
Kevin: My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it. 
Dwight: Kevin, not now.
Kevin: Hey, Jo!
Dwight: Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Kevin: No, under the jacket. 
Dwight: You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist. 
Kevin: I don't feel anything. 
Dwight: Oh, it's so wet.
Kevin: Push harder, Dwight.
Dwight: I can't. I can't push harder!
Kevin: Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Dwight: Okay, how's that? 
Kevin: Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
Dwight: I'm kneading it!
Kevin: Don't eat it.
Jo: Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel? 
Dwight: Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today. 
Jo: What?!
Dwight: I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Jo: Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you? 
Dwight: It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Jo: Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid. 
Dwight: I take full responsibility.
Jo: Who else would be responsible?
Dwight: Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
Pam: You shot a gun off -
Dwight: Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes. 
Jo: Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius. 
Dwight: Got it.
Jo: I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job. 
Dwight: [on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
Jo: No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement. 
 
Jo: You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty? 
Gabe: Yep.
Jim: Yep.
Jo: Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office? 
Toby: Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
Jo: Who is it?
 
Jim: Hey, Dwight. What's up?
Dwight: Shut up.
Jim: Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
 
Angela: [giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Kevin: Another one? 
Darryl and Angela: Yes!
Angela: Seven, two...
Oscar: Could you turn the volume down on the beeping? 
Angela: Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
Darryl: Nine first.
Angela: Nine, eight, five...
Kevin: Thank you.
Angela: Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six... 
Kevin: Nice.
Angela: Two, one...
Kevin: Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
Angela: God! 

Creed: [drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads "NEW MGR"] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
 
Creed: Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
 
Creed: [to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
 
Creed: [running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
 
Jim: He never called a meeting.
 
Creed: [pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first "B" stand for?
Pam: What are we doing?
Creed: We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first "B" stand for?
Kevin: Um... Business!
Creed: I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The "O"...
 
Pam: We need a new manager.
 
Jim: [conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Fred Henry: Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.
Jim: Really?
Fred: Yeah.
Jim: [waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
Fred: Nice try.
Toby: I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?
Fred: Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan.
Gabe: Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
Fred: [speaking faster] Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right?
Gabe: How would we know that, if you don't...
Jim: You could just be saying it to get the job.
Fred: I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that?
Jim: How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Fred: Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.
Jim: Okay.
Fred: Color-code sent documents, TM.
Jim: Did you just trademark that...
Toby: [confused] W-What?
Fred: That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.
 
Jim: We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an "Andy for Manager?" pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
 
Stanley: [in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
Darryl: Good morning.
Phyllis: [also to Darryl] Good morning.
Darryl: Good morning.
Phyllis: Did you have a nice drive in?
Darryl: I did.
 
Darryl: I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
 
Andy: [puts up a poster in the break room with "IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY" on it in bold lettering]
Erin: [commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
Andy: The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
Erin: Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
Andy: Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
Erin: You in the boss's chair!
Andy: EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
 
Andy: In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
 
Erin: [checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
Phyllis: Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
 
Phyllis: It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
Erin: So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
Phyllis: But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Erin: Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Phyllis: Mm.
Erin: But why not find out.
Phyllis: Yeah.
 
Pam: [to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
Dwight: They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Pam: Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Dwight: Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
 
Warren Buffett: Can you do any better on salary?
Jim: Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
Warren: What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know.
Jim: Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Warren: How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?
 
Angela: [on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
Kevin: The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
 
Toby: How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Robert California: You don't work in sales, do you.
Toby: Uh... Human Resources.
Robert: You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby.
Toby: Yes.
Gabe: Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
Robert: Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
Gabe: No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
Jim: Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Robert: Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
Jim: Yes.
Robert: That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?
Jim: Yes.
Robert: [more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face] 
 
Jim: [Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
 
Andy: [Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl. 
Darryl: [pats Andy on the back] Thank you.
 
Darryl: Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
Jim: [Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Darryl: So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
Gabe: Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
Darryl: Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
Toby: So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
Darryl: I thought that was your job.
Toby: Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
Jim: Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
Darryl: I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
Darryl: [noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
Jim: [ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Darryl: I... I just thought you knew me.
Jim: Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Darryl: Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
 
Merv Bronte: [at the cafe on the first floor] Did, uh, you just interview?
Robert: Ohh, unfortunately, yes.
Merv: What do you mean?
Robert: That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry.
Merv: Place must be horrible. I don't know if I want this job. [gets on elevator]
 
Merv: [in elevator] Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... I'm gonna die here.
 
Dwight: What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
Robert: I just did.
Dwight: You can't.
Robert: It's done.
Dwight: No, it's not.
Robert: I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing. [at the same time, Dwight says: You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!]
Dwight: Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
Robert: I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly]
Dwight: [standing up] Get out.
 
Dwight: I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
 
Merv: You guys pay for relocation, though, right?
Toby: Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Merv: Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.
Jim: Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Merv: [pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware] I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. [opens tupperware] You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there. [begins eating sandwich]
Jim: Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Merv: I'm having a bad time. [chuckles]
Toby: I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
Merv: [continues to chew, slower and slower, appears confused] Wait.
 
Merv: Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.
 
Angela: [limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
 
Pam: [looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
Kelly: Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
Meredith: [looks at ring, whispering] Wow...
Angela: It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Meredith: Tell us the freaking story!
Kevin: Yeah! Tell us a story.
Angela: Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
Pam: [laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Angela: Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Pam: That's not accurate.
Angela: Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
 
Oscar: Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
 
Jim: Andy? You all set?
Andy: Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
Phyllis: Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Andy: [grunts] Augh.
 
Erin: I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
 
Jim: So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
Andy: For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]
Gabe: Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Andy: I wasn't acc-, accusing...
Gabe: Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
Andy: Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
Toby: I didn't think you were.
 
Gabe: I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
 
Gabe: How many windows are there in New York City?
Andy: What?
Gabe: Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
Andy: Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Gabe: No... How far away is the Sun?
Andy: [happily] Uh, 93 million miles.
Jim: [to Gabe] Is it?
Andy: Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
Gabe: Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
 
Andy: [alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
 
Darryl: [on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say "Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
 
Creed: [on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this] 
 
Pam: How is this on me?
 
Pam: Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Creed: [takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
 
Pam: They're the same picture.
 
Kelly: Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
Jim: Your department's just you, right?
Kelly: Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
Gabe: Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a "wrap it up" motion with his pen]
Kelly: What was that?
Gabe: We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]
Kelly: [getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
Gabe: What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
Kelly: I don't have any, assh***.
Dwight: [comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
 
Dwight: [walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
Jim: Good!
Dwight: Good. They good?
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
Jim: Peepa.
Dwight: Peepa, how is she?
Jim: Great.
Dwight: Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Jim: No.
Dwight: Now, listen,...
Jim: You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Dwight: Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
Jim: [pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.
Dwight: I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
Jim: Yikes.
Dwight: Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
Jim: Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Dwight: Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back]
Jim: Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Dwight: Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
Jim: Thank you.
Dwight: Okay. [looks ashamed]
 
Oscar: Pam... I think Robert is gay.
Pam: The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
Oscar: [whispers] So!?
Pam: And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
Oscar: I have a very strong suspicion.
Pam: Did you see him at a bathhouse?
Oscar: What bathhouse?
Pam: The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
Oscar: [confused, whispers] What?
Pam: Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
 
Oscar: My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
Pam: You're in the gay mafia.
Oscar: You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant. 
Ryan: You guys, um, talking Senator?
Pam: No.
Oscar: No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Ryan: 'Cause he's totally gay? [walks away]
 
Ryan: Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He "liked" my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
 
David Brent: [on video resume on a laptop] Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear you're looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they don't see things your way? Then I ain't that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? You've changed your mind? You're now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too. [points at self] When do I start? Yeah. [Jim looks uninterested in this candidate]
 
Phyllis: Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Erin: [trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
Phyllis: Bestiality. Yeah.
Erin: Well, that's not my personality.
Phyllis: If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
Erin: Yes?
Phyllis: I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
 
Erin: I do really want him.
 
Darryl: So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
Jim: Great.
Darryl: Hope it's all right.
Jim: I'm sure it's fine.
Darryl: The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
Jim: Howard Cline?
Darryl: Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
Jim: [checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.
Darryl: Yes. How did he do?
Jim: He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Darryl: Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Jim: Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
 
Nellie Bertram: First, I'll take down the cubicle walls. 
Toby: But there aren't...
Nellie: Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Gabe: A little un-specific.
Nellie: Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
Jim: That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Nellie: Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
Gabe: How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
Nellie: Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
Gabe: Okay.
Nellie: By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
Jim: I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Nellie: Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor. 
Jim: That's very...
Nellie: You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee! 
Gabe: Okay, that's not gonna be...
Nellie: Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
 
Oscar: Is there a front runner?
Jim: You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
Oscar: Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Jim: No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Oscar: Well...
Stanley: The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
Ryan: [in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
Stanley: My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
Jim: Uh--
Meredith: You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
Jim: Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Oscar: Are you? [leaves]
Ryan: Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
 
Jo: [walks in with her dogs] Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this. [gives the dog leashes and multiple bags to Gabe] 
Gabe: All right.
Jo: Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
Jim: No, was it good?
Jo: Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though. [picks up resume from Jim's desk] Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?
Darryl: Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Jo: Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?
Darryl: Paper material, ma'am.
Jo: Paper material?
Darryl: [softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
Dwight: [clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Jo: Or what? You gonna shoot me?
Dwight: Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
Jo: I'll interview you right now.
Dwight: Okay.
Jo: Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
Dwight: It's complicated.
Jo: Yeah, but see... it's not.
 
Phyllis: I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Pam: I'm a woman. I would want to know.
Meredith: Yeah, you gotta know.
Kevin: Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
Oscar: You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Phyllis: You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
Pam: She does seem happy.
Oscar: You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Kevin: We don't tell her.
Pam: Okay.
 
Kelly: Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
Jo: Okay.
Kelly: Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Jo: Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. [Jo's phone starts vibrating, she picks it up and sees Dwight has texted her "Dwight's ability as a manager has lead him to higher levels of proffesional success,"] Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!
 
Creed: [to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
Jordan: Who is our biggest client?
Pam: Uh, just put him through to me.
Jordan: [laughs] Okay.
Pam: Hello! This is... the client.
Creed: It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
Pam: Yes.
Creed: Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
Pam: Great.
Creed: All right, thank you, bye-bye.
Pam: Thank you, bye-bye.
 
Erin: [knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
Jo: Huh?
Erin: [motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Jo: No, send him in. [to Search Committee] Who is this?
Gabe: I have no idea.
Jim: [seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. "Soo-ven-yay." Mr. "Jacques Soo-ven-yay." Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight: [mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight: [again] Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: What is it?
Dwight: [in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
Jo: I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn't here in sixty seconds...
Dwight: Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
Jim: [looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
Dwight: [whispers] Yeah.
Jim: [looks astonished] Ohhhh!
Gabe: Very unprofessional, "Jacques." Or, should I say, Dwight.
Jo: Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
Dwight: I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
Jo: All that for this job.
Dwight: Yes.
Jo: That's f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob.
 
Jim: This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, "just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear."
Jo: Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited?
Jim: Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Jo: Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him?
Gabe: How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a "zero" hand gesture]
Jo: And that's your unbiased opinion.
Gabe: Yes, it is.
Jo: So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
Gabe: Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
Jo: Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you.
Gabe: That sounds like a promotion!
Jo: It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.
Jim: Um... why Kelly?
Jo: 'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.
Jim: Okay.
 
Jo: How'd my girl Nellie do?
Jim: Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
Jo: She didn't mention it?
Jim: No.
Jo: Integrity move. I like it.
Jim: You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
Jo: Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.
 
Erin: [hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Oscar: Erin, what are you doing?
Erin: I've been turned into a puppet!
Oscar: Okay. [walks away]
Kevin: [giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
Erin: I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Kevin: [giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
Erin: And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
 
Kevin: It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
 
Erin: [as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
Dwight: Silence?
Erin: A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Andy: Hey, Erin. 
Erin: [gets up] Oh.
Andy: Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
Erin: [shrugs] I've done it all my life.
Andy: Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
 
Andy: Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
 
Angela: [loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Stanley: I'll get over it.
Angela: I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Pam: That was our dream wedding.
Angela: Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions? 
Pam: [looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
Angela: Hmm.
 
Jim: All right. Name.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute.
Jim: Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
Dwight: You have to interview me...
Jim: I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
Dwight: I demand more questions!
Jim: [ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Dwight: Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
Jim: Yes.
Dwight: What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
Jim: Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight: Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
Jim: Well, that was quick.
Kelly: [sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
Jim: He's not a real candidate.
Kelly: I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
Jim: You took the deal.
Kelly: Yeah, it was a great deal.
Jim: That's not okay.
Kelly: I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
Toby: Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
Jim: What is happening right now?
 
Phyllis: Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Jim: No, why would you think that?
Phyllis: He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Jim: Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
Kelly: That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Jim: No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Dwight: Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
Jim: Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Andy: Tuna... You're completely sane.
Jim: Thank you.
Andy: Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
Jim: Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Kevin: Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Jim: [while sighing] I suppose I am.
Kevin: Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
Oscar: I don't think he meant, that--
Kevin: So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Oscar: Go ahead.
Kevin: What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
Oscar: Can I say...?
Jim: Yes.
Oscar: I think it should be Darryl.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Oscar: Kelly's on your side.
Kelly: I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
Andy: Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Ryan: I want an outsider.
Jim: Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Ryan: No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
Pam: A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
Ryan: No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Pam: No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
Ryan: Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
 
Ryan: I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
 
Meredith: I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Jim: Hey! Hey! Hey!
Meredith: Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
Andy: She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
Gabe: [walks in] Gotta catch a plane.
Pam: Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
Gabe: Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
Kelly: You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Gabe: Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
Kelly: I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
Gabe: There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
Kevin: Later, man.
All: [various] Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job. 
Ryan: Take care, man.
Dwight: We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]
Andy: [stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
Erin: I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
Phyllis: Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
 
Phyllis: No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
 
Jim: What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Angela: Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Toby: No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
Kevin: Exactly.
Darryl: [enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
Jada: Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?
Darryl: [sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
Jada: I don't know if he'd be a good manager [Jim shakes his head and looks wide-eyed at Darryl], but he's a really great dad!
Darryl: Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
Phyllis: It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Jim: What? No, no, it's not a vote.
Phyllis: Then what was this all about?
Jim: I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
Kelly: I don't care. They can just vote.
Jim: No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
 
Andy: Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
 
Nellie: This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
 
Darryl: Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
 
Fred: No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of... [looks back to glance at lobby directory] Vance Refrigeration.
 
Merv: Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today.
 
Robert: [chuckles] I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response.
 
Finger Lakes Guy: [geeky voice] I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they'll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes.
 
Dwight: I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
 
Creed: You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
Pam: [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?
Creed: I think you two should meet.
Pam: Well, okay!
Creed: Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
Pam as "fourth-biggest client": [in a comedic male voice] Hello! 
Pam as "ninth-biggest client": [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Hello!
Pam as "fourth-biggest client": Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]
Pam as "ninth-biggest client": Ohho! I'm good! Don't you just love paper, and things about paper!
Pam as "fourth-biggest client": Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!
Creed: It's Kismet!
