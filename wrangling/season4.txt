Michael: Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. [walks into bedroom, Jan sleeping on bed] This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. [sighs] She probably won't be up for a few hours.
 
Michael: This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed. [slams on breaks, camera turns, Meredith rolls off the hood]
 
IT Tech Guy: You know generally it's not a good idea to click on offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer?
Pam: It was for a video.
IT Tech Guy: Yeah, what kind of video?
Pam: A celebrity sex tape.
Jim: Really, what kind of celebrity?
Pam: Not relevant.
Jim: How much did you pay for it?
Pam: Not relevant.
Jim: You paid for it?
Pam: It all happened so fast.
 
Jim: I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
 
Pam: Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
 
Kevin: Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
Oscar: I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
Kevin: Are you kidding me?
 
Pam: And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
Jim: Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
Pam: Cool.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: Well have fun with that.
 
Michael: Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
Jim: What?
Dwight: Where?
Michael: It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
Stanley: What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
Oscar: So she's really going to be fine?
Michael: Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
Pam: Thank God you were there.
Michael: Yeah.
Andy: Did you see who did it?
Dwight: No need we can just check the security tapes.
Michael: Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
Jim: Who was driving?
Pam: Oh, Michael.
 
Jim: One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
 
Dwight: It's only Meredith.
Michael: Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
Dwight: Hey... Why did you do it?
Michael: It was an accident.
Dwight: Was she talkin' back?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
 
Pam: Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
Kevin: Who's we, you and Jim?
Pam: No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
Kevin: Oh, I bet Jim goes too.
Pam: Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.
Kevin: Oh, I bet you ask?
Pam: I was planning on it.
Kevin: I bet you were.
Pam: Angela?
Oscar: [whispers to Kevin] Subtle.
Kevin: What
Pam: [to Angela] Are you coming?
Angela: I can't, Sprinkles is sick.
 
Angela: She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
 
Angela: I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
Pam: Can't your other cats keep her company.
Angela: There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
Pam: Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.
Angela: [sighs] All right!
 
Michael: My lord my liege.
Ryan: Yes Michael?
 
Michael: So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?
 
Michael: So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
Ryan: Back? Why is that Michael?
Michael: Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
Ryan: Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
Michael: No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
Ryan: Did this happen on company property?
Michael: Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
Ryan: I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Michael: Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?
Ryan: [sigh]
 
Ryan: People keep calling me a "Wunderkind"; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
 
Angela: Hey D.
Dwight: Hey monkey, what's up?
Angela: Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
Dwight: Sure.
Angela: I have to visit the alchy.
Dwight: Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
Angela: I wouldn't put it past her.
Dwight: So what do you need me to do?
Angela: I wrote it out.
Dwight: Mm-hmm.
Angela: There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
 
Michael: Ok, I have an announcement.
Oscar: You pushed Darryl out the window?
Michael: No.
Phyllis: You shot Dwight?
Michael: No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
Jim: Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Pam: OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
Michael: So, like a freedom tree.
Pam: I can take 3 people.
Jim: I can also take 3 people.
Oscar: [to Kevin] Separate cars.
Michael: Pam.
Pam: Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
Michael: Pam.
Pam: Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
Michael: Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
Pam: I...
Michael: Excellent!
Pam: I was thinking that we...
Michael: Good work Pam.
Pam: But...
Michael: Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
Stanley: You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
Michael: Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
 
Michael: Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.
 
Michael: Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
Kelly: She looks awful.
Michael: No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
Jim: I think she's awake.
Michael: No... She's in a coma.
Nurse: No.
Michael: OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
Meredith: At the same time.
Michael: Yeah.
Stanley: Hello Meredith.
Meredith: This is weird.
Michael: Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!
Kevin: Whoa!
Michael: Nurse.
Meredith: No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
Michael: [groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
Jim: I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Nurse: What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.
Meredith: Thanks.
Kevin: [applauds]
Phyllis: Does it hurt terribly?
Meredith: No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
Creed: Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...
Meredith: I have no idea.
Creed: Oh. [laughs]
Meredith: Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
Michael: Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
Meredith: Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
Michael: Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
Angela: No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
Michael: Well, just shhhh... just just...
Meredith: You cracked my pelvis
Michael: Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
Meredith: You're not forgiven.
Michael: Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
Pam: Michael! Michael!
Meredith: [screams]
 
Michael: Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
 
Angela: Hey.
Dwight: Hey monkey.
Angela: Any problems?
Dwight: Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
Angela: What!?
Dwight: Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
Angela: Sprinkles.
Dwight: That was the sick one, right?
Angela: Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
Dwight: No.
Angela: Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
Dwight: Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
Angela: [sobbing]
Dwight: So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
Angela: Alright.
Dwight: Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
Angela: [still sobbing]
 
Pam: [to Angela] It's gonna be OK.
Michael: OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...
Pam: Michael, Angela's cat died.
Michael: Sprinkles?
Angela: [nods]
Michael: [sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
 
Michael: Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.
 
Michael: Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
Oscar: Like what?
Michael: Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
Toby: No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
Pam: That's cool.
Toby: Yeah.
Michael: Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
Angela: Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
Dwight: She's only a cat.
Angela: You never... you don't like them.
Dwight: Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Oscar: Dwight please!
Michael: Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
Dwight: No, I have not.
Michael: Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
Dwight: I do not respect her, but I will go.
Michael: Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
Toby: Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
Michael: Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
Toby: Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
Michael: Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
Stanley: I'm... um, Catholic.
Michael: OK.
Darryl: Presbyterian.
Michael: Alright.
Pam: Oh me too.
Darryl: Oh?
Pam: [puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
Darryl: Alright! [high fives Pam]
Phyllis: I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
Angela: That's why we're cursed.
 
Creed: I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.
 
Michael: Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
Kelly: That's Buddhist.
Michael: Are you sure?
Kelly: No.
Michael: What are you?
IT Tech Guy: Well if you're going to reduce my identity to my religion then I'm Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I'm restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.
Michael: OK, 1 Sikh, and...
 
Dwight: As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
 
Dwight: Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Meredith: Don't pull any plugs.
Intern: How are you doing Ms. Palmer?
Meredith: Better.
Intern: Excellent.
Dwight: Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
Intern: Um... I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor, but...
Dwight: Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
Intern: Ah, so uh... so that is where her uterus went... Um, Ms. Palmer, your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?
Meredith: Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
Dwight: Just doing my job.
Intern: It also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?
Meredith: And a rat. Separate occasions.
 
Michael: You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.
Kelly: If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
Michael: Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine. 
Jim: I will do some research.
Pam: I can help you with that.
 
Dwight: So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
Michael: Oh God, Rabies?
Dwight: Mm-hmm.
Michael: I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
Dwight: No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
Michael: This place is so cursed.
Dwight: Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
Michael: [walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
Jim: Six of one, really.
Michael: Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.
 
Michael: Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?
 
Kevin: [Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
Pam: [Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
 
Pam: Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
Michael: Pro-Am.
Pam: Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
 
Michael: A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.
 
Stanley: [on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
Michael: Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
Stanley: Zero.
Michael: Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
Andy: Isn't that your money?
Michael: That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?
Phyllis: Oh, it's coming.
Michael: Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
Kevin: Michael?
Michael: Yes.
Kevin: You cannot make me run.
Michael: OK. [walks away]
Kevin: It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
Michael: Alright, alright.
Kevin: You didn't run for me...
Michael: Shhh...
Kevin: ...when I thought I had skin cancer.
Michael: I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
Kevin: No.
Michael: OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
Kevin: I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Michael: Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
 
Andy: [in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]
 
Andy: Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]
 
Angela: This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
 
Angela: Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
Pam: What's wrong?
Angela: I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
Pam: Hmm...
Angela: When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
Pam: Ah.
Angela: Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
Pam: Angela, I'm sorry.
Angela: Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
Pam: I'm more of a dog person.
Angela: [sighs]
 
Jim: So what's your strategy for this race?
Pam: Well I'm gonna start fast.
Jim: Mm-hmm.
Pam: Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
Jim: What?
Pam: Then I'm gonna end fast.
Jim: Why won't more people do that? [laughs]
Pam: Cause they're just stupid.
Jim: [looks at camera] What?
 
Jim: [Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
Pam: Yeah... That was um...
Jim: I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
Pam: Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
Jim: Right!
Pam: ... We're dating.
Jim: Wow! There it is.
Pam: Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?
Jim: It is going really great.
 
Dwight: [Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!
Angela: Shut up.
Dwight: You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Angela: Oh, really?
Dwight: [sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
Angela: [pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
 
Michael: We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?
Pam: Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
Michael: Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
Jim: Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Pam: Giant check it is.
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Yep.
Dwight: Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
Jim: Bat birth control
Dwight: Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
Michael: You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
Pam: Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
Jim: Which we are.
Pam: And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
Michael: What about a rabies nurse?
Pam: I don't think so.
Jim: You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Michael: That's possible. Look into that.
Jim: Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
Dwight: Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Michael: Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.
 
Pam: Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
Michael: Come in.
Pam: Hey.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey
Pam: Oh my God.
Michael: What are you doing?
Pam: You said come in!
Michael: No I didn't, just please don't...
Pam: Oh my God.
 
Pam: So I closed the door but the image of his...
Jim: Baquette.
Pam: ... dangling participle...
Jim: Eww.
Pam: ... still burned in my eyes.
Jim: I can imagine.
Pam: [Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.
Michael: May I enter the room?
Pam: Yes. Or come in.
Michael: See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
Jim: You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
Michael: Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
Pam: On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
Michael: European offices are naked all the time.
Pam: They're so not.
Michael: Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
Pam: I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
Jim: [sighs] Gross.
Michael: That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.
Jim: Alright.
 
Pam: They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
 
Jim: [naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
 
Jan: OK, name please.
Creed: Creed Bratton, 75 plus division.
Jan: You're over 75 years old?
Creed: 82 November first. How much is the prize money?
Jan: There's no prize money.
Creed: What, is any of this real?
 
Michael: Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?
 
Jan: So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
Pam: What? Look, no it was not...
Jan: I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
Michael: OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
Darryl: [feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
Michael: No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
Darryl: Look how happy he is.
Michael: He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.
Elizabeth: Hello Michael.
Michael: Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?
Elizabeth: Yeah.
Michael: Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
Elizabeth: Great. [everyone claps]
 
Michael: You got it?
Dwight: Mm-hmm.
Michael: OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
 
Michael: Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.
Dwight: On your marks, get set...
Michael: [pulls Toby's pants down] Beow!
Toby: Hey! [extremely loud gunshot]
 
Michael: On your left!
Oscar: You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
Creed: That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!
Michael: I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]
 
Stanley: Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
 
Andy: I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]
 
Pam: Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place.
Jim: Oh, would you look at that.
Pam: Darn it.
 
Jan: Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
Michael: No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
Jan: Michael that's irrational.
 
Michael: Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
 
Andy: Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.
 
Creed: [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
Waitress: OK.
Creed: Thanks.
Stanley: So we've got what, another 20 minutes?
Oscar: More or less.
Stanley: Hmmm...
 
Michael: That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
Dwight: You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
Michael: [laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
 
Toby: I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
 
Jim: Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
Pam: I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
Jim: OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Pam: Mmm... Yes.
Jim: That's what I thought.
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Right. Let's do some good.
 
Ryan: [Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message" Ryan hangs up]
 
Michael: [Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans]
 
Andy: [runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.
Kevin: Back off me.
 
Dwight: How ya feeling, better?
Angela: No.
Dwight: Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
Angela: The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
Dwight: I am a farmer Angela.
Angela: What does that mean?
Dwight: OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
Angela: You did kill her!?
Dwight: I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
Angela: You put her in my freezer.
Dwight: It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
Angela: Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
Dwight: Well I'm not responsible for that!
Angela: You! [hits Dwight]
Dwight: Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.
Angela: It's OK.
Dwight: It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
Angela: It's nothing.
Dwight: It's fine. What?
Angela: How could you do that without telling me?
Dwight: I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
Angela: Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
Dwight: I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
Angela: You don't understand.
Michael: [runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
Dwight: Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
Angela: Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]
 
Pam: [holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
Jim: Oh, and I get to carry it.
 
Toby: [crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
Kelly: Have a seat, I'll write it down.
Toby: Where are we?
Kelly: I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
Toby: He couldn't have made it a circle?
 
Michael: [bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]
 
Jim: ...talk about it.
Pam: Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?
Jim: What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
Michael: I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...
Jim: Well, you're probably dehydrated.
Michael: What do you want me to do Jim?
Jim: Glass of water would be a start.
Michael: No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
Jim: Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
Pam: I'm still having a nice day.
Jim: You are?
Pam: Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
Michael: That's a good deal.
Pam: And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
Michael: Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
Pam: Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
Michael: You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
Pam: I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
Michael: You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!
 
Michael: Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.
 
Meredith: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey Mer. How ya doing?
Meredith: Better.
Michael: It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
Meredith: I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
Michael: Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?
Meredith: Sure.
Michael: I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.

Pam: Hey.
Jim: Hey.
Pam: I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim]
Jim: Oh wow, thank you.
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
Pam: No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?
Jim: I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
 
Michael: Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff]
Toby: Ohh.
Michael: [reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
Toby: Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
Michael: Oh really.
Toby: ...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
Michael: Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
Toby: Ok, look the memo is not about you...
Angela: [to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
Toby: Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
Michael: [turns to address Jim and Pam] No way.
Dwight: What?
Phyllis: You guys are together?
Jim: Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
Michael: Woooah! Wow!
Andy: Tuna!
Michael: Awesome!
Kevin: I knew it!
Michael: You guys! Yes! Yes!
Pam: Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
Toby: Yes.
Michael: Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
Jim: Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Michael: I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]
Jim: Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
Pam: Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk]
Michael: No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
 
Dwight: I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
 
Angela: It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
 
Andy: Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
 
Michael: Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
Phyllis: Did you plan it?
Michael: No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]
Pam: [reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
Michael: Blowing up balloons I thought.
Pam: You might want to trim it a little.
Phyllis: Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
Kelly: [reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Pam: Yeah, he is.
Kelly: Oh.
 
Michael: Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
 
Angela: What do you want?
Dwight: To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
Angela: Oh, what is that?
Dwight: It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Angela: Her name was Sprinkles.
Dwight: And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
Angela: I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
Dwight: You haven't buried her yet?
Angela: Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
Dwight: Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.
Angela: I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
 
Pam: Hey Toby.
Toby: Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.
Jim: Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
Toby: Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.
Jim: Oh.
Pam: Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]
Toby: Uh huh.
Jim: Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Toby: Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
Jim: What?
Toby: Let's just wait.
Jim: Oh, OK.
Pam: OK.
Jim: Great. [Jim and Pam walk away]
 
Pam: [sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Ryan: Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Michael: Hey!
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.
Ryan: OK. Should we get started?
Michael: Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
Ryan: Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
Michael: ...business meeting --
Kevin: [rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] Fire!
Ryan: Stop that! Stop that!
Michael: That's right! That's right!
Ryan: [to Kevin] You scared me.
Michael: Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.
Andy: Fire guy [makes flames with his hands]
Kevin: You weren't here for that.
Andy: Here for what?
Kevin: When he started the fire. 
Michael: Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...
Kevin: Little old man boy.
Ryan: Michael and everybody, umm...
Michael: Beard.
Kevin: Bearded man boy.
Ryan: ...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Michael: Oh, wow!
Ryan: So...
Michael: That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
Ryan: OK...
Michael: Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
Ryan: Enough! OK? This is inappropriate and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Michael: Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?
Ryan: Perfect.
Michael: Sounds good. OK, alright.
 
Michael: Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words.
 
Ryan: Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
 
Jim: Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading "Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!"]
 
Ryan: This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Michael: OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
Ryan: I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
Dwight: What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
Ryan: This is company-wide, Dwight.
Dwight: Got it. [Andy's hand goes up]
Ryan: Andy.
Andy: We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
Ryan: Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
Kelly: Can we speak privately about our relationship?
Ryan: Thank you everybody.
Michael: Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave]
Creed: That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Ryan: As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
Creed: Cool beans.
 
Creed: We're screwed.
Michael: Who is?
Creed: Us? You and me. The old timers.
Michael: I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
Creed: You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
 
Jim: Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
Pam: No.. [in awe]
Jim: Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
Pam: No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
Jim: Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
Pam: You didn't say anything to me?
Jim: Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Pam: Can you believe that...
Phyllis: Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
Jim: Oh no, we're just sitting here.
Phyllis: I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
Pam: OK.
Phyllis: OK.
Jim: OK.
 
Jim: And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
 
Ryan: OK, what's up?
Michael: Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
Ryan: Well it is business, but not as usual.
Michael: Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
Ryan: No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
Michael: Good, so, we're on the same page?
Ryan: No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
 
Michael: We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.
 
Ryan: So, how are you?
Kelly: Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
Ryan: Good.
Kelly: A lot. Black guys mostly.
Ryan: Kelly...
Kelly: What?!
 
Phyllis: Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Stanley: I don't know.
Phyllis: Did you even try?
Stanley: If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
Phyllis: I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
Stanley: It's too little. Use the phone.
 
Kelly: I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Ryan: Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
Kelly: Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
Ryan: I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
Kelly: Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
 
Kelly: [shaking head]
 
Kelly: And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
Ryan: OK. OK.
Kelly: Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Ryan: I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
 
Kelly: We have a date!
 
Dwight: Hello.
Angela: Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
Dwight: Really?
Angela: Yes.
Dwight: I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
Angela: I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
 
Jan: Hi, Pam.
Pam: Hi.
Jan: Is Michael in?
Pam: In his office. You can go right in.
Jan: [to Ryan] Hey.
Ryan: Jan.
Jan: Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
Ryan: So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
Jan: Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
Ryan: Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Jan: Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.
Ryan: Well... you look great.
Jan: Thank you, thank you.
Ryan: Scranton suits you.
Jan: Best decision I ever made.
Ryan: You were let go.
Jan: You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]
Michael: Hey.
Jan: Hey.
 
Michael: [holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
Jan: What?
Michael: I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
Jan: So, what's Ryan doing here?
Michael: Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
Jan: He's such a snake.
Michael: Well...
Jan: I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
Michael: What is that... word?
Jan: Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Michael: So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
Jan: Yes, Michael, they do.
 
Oscar: Creed?
Creed: Yes, sir.
Oscar: Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
Creed: Everything's cool, dude.
 
Creed: I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
 
Ryan: Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Pam: Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
Ryan: [notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man.
Michael: Good, we're all here, we can get started.
Ryan: Michael.
Michael: Have a seat.
Ryan: We're not doing this today.
Michael: Have a seat. Like everybody else.
Ryan: OK. This is...
Michael: Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
Toby: Technically, he's right.
Michael: Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
Creed: Because they're lame.
Michael: No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?" [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.
Jim: Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
Pam: Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
Michael: I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
Pam: Oh. [man enters conference room]
Robert Dunder: Michael Scott?
Michael: [puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]
Dwight: Oh, yeah. Yes!
Robert Dunder: Thank you everyone.
Ryan: Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
Michael: Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door]
 
Ryan: We have actual work to do.
Michael: Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other]
 
Michael: Bob, how old are you?
Robert Dunder: I'm 87.
Michael: Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
Robert Dunder: Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.
Michael: Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
 
Dwight: I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
 
Robert Dunder: I started this company in 1949.
Michael: Wow.
Robert Dunder: Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.
Michael: Oh, boy.
Robert Dunder: And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later... Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.
Michael: Great.
Robert Dunder: And he was, he was [starts laughing] at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm... uhh... Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.
Michael: Great. 
Robert Dunder: And...
Michael: That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
Robert Dunder: Well I, I, I came here in a cab.
Michael: Perfect. [starts closing the door]
Robert Dunder: Well, cou, could you get me another... [Michael closes door]
Michael: Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]
Pam: I think that I should help him get home.
Michael: No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.
 
Michael: Good night guys. [staff leaves the office]
Ryan: Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
Michael: I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
Ryan: Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
Michael: I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
Ryan: Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
Kelly: You know, some place romantic and expensive.
Ryan: Kelly, come on.
Kelly: You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
 
Dwight: Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
Angela: Very much. How's your meat?
Dwight: Dry. Delicious.
Angela: I heard a joke today.
Dwight: Oh, that's funny.
Angela: Yes, it was.
Dwight: Are you enjoying your mineral water?
Angela: I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
Dwight: Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.
Angela: I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Dwight: No, please don't do this, monkey.
Angela: I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
 
New Scene
 
Toby: Hey guys. This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
Pam: Hi.
Jim: Hey, Amy. How ya doing?
Pam: Nice to meet you.
Jim: [under his breath] Nice to meet you.
Toby: [gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
Amy: Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight, right?
Toby: Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]
Amy: Whoa. Easy tiger.
Toby: I just really like you.
Amy: Okay. Bye guys. Nice to meet you.
Toby: Have a great day!
Pam: Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
Toby: I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
 
Michael: Smell that. Do you smell that? 
Dwight: Dry rot?
Michael: No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
Andy: Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.
Michael: Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.
 
Michael: Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
 
Dwight: Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
Angela: Thank you.
Dwight: You're welcome. 
Angela: Is that all?
Dwight: Yes... [whispers] I miss you.
Angela: Elevators.
 
Angela: Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
Dwight: Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.
Angela: Good.
Dwight: Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
Angela: [walks away]
 
Kelly: I don't understand what the big deal is.
Ryan: You don't?
Kelly: No!
Ryan: You lied about being pregnant.
Kelly: Right, so?
Ryan: You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
Kelly: No!
Ryan: We're never getting back together.
Kelly: Why not?
 
Jim: Hey.
Pam: Hey.
Jim: Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
Pam: It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
Jim: I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
Pam: I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but... 
Jim: Be honest.
Pam: I now find you repulsive.
Jim: That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
Pam: Eh...
Jim: For me, it was.
Pam: OK.
Jim: Alright.
 
Michael: Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.
Ryan: What's, uh, going on here?
Michael: I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
Ryan: With gift baskets.
Michael: With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.
 
Michael: Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. "You can't be on the team", "You can't move on to second grade". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
 
Michael: OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
Stanley: I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]
Andy: I'll go with you Stanley.
Stanley: Or him.
Jim: Why don't we just go by ourselves?
Michael: Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
Phyllis: Michael.
Michael: Yes?
Phyllis: This is stupid.
Michael: OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
Phyllis: How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Michael: Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
Andy: What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.
Jim: What about a gift basket full of cash?
Andy: Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
Michael: Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]
Dwight: Michael, wait. Let me go.
Michael: No, this is my quest.
Dwight: Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.
Michael: Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
Ryan: Good luck Michael.
Michael: We don't need luck.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
Dwight: Thank you.
 
Michael: Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
 
Ryan: [speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
Creed: [looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
 
Dwight: [in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
Michael: It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
Dwight: Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
Michael: I know. So who's next?
Dwight: Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
GPS: Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin.
Dwight: Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Michael: Who?
Dwight: The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]
 
Ryan: Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
Kevin: No way!
Ryan: Literally.
Andy: Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.
Ryan: ... Later guys.
Kevin: Yeah, later dude.
Andy: Later man.
Kevin: Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
Jim: Yeah, he's definitely something.
Kevin: What does that mean?
Jim: That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Andy: Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Kevin: Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Andy: He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
Kevin: And he can get any girl that he wants.
Andy: So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.
Kevin: Tuna. Check you later.
 
Michael: [places the gift basket on top of the table] Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
Larry Myers: You know we closed our account with you right?
Michael: Yes we do.
Larry Myers: We're with Office Depot now.
Dwight: Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
Michael: Well... 
Dwight: And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
Michael: Mmhmm.
Larry Myers: OK. I don't think we're coming back.
Dwight: Please, come back.
Michael: OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
Dwight: Remember what we had Larry?
Larry Myers: I mean, really it's about money.
Michael: Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
Larry Myers: OK thanks.
Michael: Alright.
Larry Myers: I mean their website is really easy to use too. That's a big deal for us.
 
Michael: [driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
Dwight: I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
Michael: That is true.
Dwight: Like Angela in accounting.
Michael: Yes, she is nuts.
Dwight: Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
GPS: Make the next right turn.
Michael: How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
 
Ryan: Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Pam: Uh totally.
Ryan: Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
Pam: Yeah.
Ryan: Thank you very much.
Pam: Thank you.
Ryan: Cool.
Pam: OK.
 
Pam: Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
 
Michael: And the last guy says "No, hairy body".
Ex-client: You know I have heard it before.
Michael: Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?
Ex-client: She's great, thanks for asking. Great memory.
Michael: She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
Ex-client: Oh, OK.
Michael: OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?
Ex-client: OK thanks for the goodies.
Michael: Ah... .is that all you have to say?
Ex-client: It looks delicious? I don't know.
Dwight: You don't know?
Michael: Look, we want you back.
Ex-client: Can you offer lower prices?
Michael: Well, no.
Ex-client: Then we're not coming back.
Dwight: He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
Michael: No it's not.
Ex-client: No he's right.
Dwight: Accept it, why would he come back?
Michael: Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
Dwight: That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Michael: Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
Ex-client: Oh, OK. Well when it's up, I'll check it out, and if it really cuts costs maybe we'll come back.
Michael: Great, the magic of the gift basket.
Ex-client: That I don't care about as much. Let me know when the site's up.
Michael: OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.
 
GPS: Proceed straight. 
Dwight: [in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Michael: I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
Dwight: That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
Michael: That is a very good point, Dwight.
GPS: Make a right turn.
Dwight: Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
Michael: No, it said right, it said take a right.
Dwight: No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Michael: Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right]
Dwight: It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
Michael: The machine knows where it is going!
Dwight: This is the lake!
Michael: The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
Dwight: No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]
Dwight: Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!
Michael: Let go, let go of me!
Dwight: I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]
 
Michael: [watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK?
Dwight: Fine.
Michael: Good, that is what's most important.
Dwight: Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
 
Michael: What a disaster, this whole thing.
Dwight: I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]
Michael: These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.
Dwight: Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
Michael: What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
Dwight: [speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
Michael: Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!
Dwight: Take a stand!
 
Pam: So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
Ryan: I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
Pam: Thanks.
Ryan: I'd love to talk to you about it more.
Pam: That'd be great.
Ryan: Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
Pam: Oh... is it... 
Ryan: Wear something nice.
Pam: No... 
Ryan: What?
Pam: Um... 
Ryan: I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
Pam: I'm uh, I'm dating Jim.
Ryan: You're kidding?
Pam: We're together.
Ryan: That's... great, I... that's awesome. 
Pam: Yeah, great.
Ryan: [grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
Pam: OK great!
Ryan: Cool.
Pam: Great.
 
Jim: I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
 
Ex-client: Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?
Michael: Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
Ex-client: Oh what is this?
Dwight: It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
Ex-client: Maybe you should leave. 
Michael: Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch]
Dwight: Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!
Michael: Look, my clothes are so wet!
Dwight: Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]
Ex-client: [comes back with gift basket] Alright here you go, take it back!
Michael: It's been opened.
Ex-client: Yeah it was mine!
Michael: What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
Ex-client: Come on guys, get out of here!
Michael: WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
Dwight: [enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Ex-client: I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone!
Dwight: [leaving] We'll bill you.
 
Michael: May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
Ryan: That is not correct.
Michael: Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
Oscar: You did what?
Michael: I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.
Jim: Into a lake.
Michael: Exactly!
Phyllis: Did you get any clients back?
Michael: Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
 
Michael: Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
 
Ryan: I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars. 

Michael: And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination.
 
Jim: There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.
 
Pam: I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing! Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
 
Michael: We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]
Andy: Dah! Come on!
Michael: Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.
Oscar: It's never gonna happen.
Kevin: Dude, you gotta believe.
Michael: Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Jim: [to Pam] Wait for it.
Michael: Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a "Where's Waldo." [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]
Everyone: Oh! Yes!
Michael: [everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.
Kevin: That was so awesome.
Michael: That was awesome. Thank you.
 
Michael: Some days I am just on fire. What can I say? 
 
Meredith: Hey... there he is.
Jim: Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?
Meredith: I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
Jim: Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well we all came, so... 
Meredith: Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
Jim: Haha...
Meredith: Anyway, I have this Sharpie... 
Jim: Uh-huh.
Meredith: And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
Jim: MmmHmm...
Meredith: [lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
Jim: Oh yeah.
Meredith: [whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
Jim: Alright...
 
Pam: Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
Michael: Oh, does he?
Pam: He does.
Michael: Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you.
Jim: Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Michael: And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
 
Michael: Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen... 
 
Michael: The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight.
Dwight: That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
Jim: Actually it sounds like you are.
Dwight: Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?
Kelly: If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
Michael: No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.
Stanley: Yes, please let us know.
Dwight: I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Angela: Waste of time.
Michael: What's that, pipsqueak?
Angela: Waste of time. The website's going to win.
Dwight: You believe a computer can beat me?
Angela: I don't care, but yes.
Dwight: Well I will prove you wrong.
Angela: I don't care, and you won't.
Dwight: We'll see.
Angela: I won't be watching, and I won't.
 
Pam: Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
 
Phyllis: Stanley, you're dancing!
Stanley: No I'm not.
 
Ryan: Yeah. I created a website. Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
Voice of Thomas Dean: I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall.
 
Ryan: Convergence. Viral marketing. We're going guerrilla. We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street. Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buyin' paper just became fun.
 
Andy: And this is where I will record your sales.
Dwight: Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.
Andy: And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
Jim: Or zipadeedoodaah.
Andy: I can't tell if he's mocking me.
Dwight: Just ignore him.
Andy: Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go.
Jim: I was... mocking.
Andy: Thank you.
Dwight: I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Andy: Yes like a chime or a bell... 
Jim: Or a gong.
Dwight: Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me.
Andy: Yes!
 
Kevin: Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Angela: Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party! What is wrong with you?
 
Phyllis: Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw. So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
 
Phyllis: So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
Angela: I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
Phyllis: I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
Angela: It is awful. You've made this day awful!
Kevin: Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Angela: Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
Michael: Ohh, lunch party.
Angela: It's supposed to say launch!
Michael: Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
Angela: I care!
 
Angela: Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still dead.
 
Andy: Twenty seconds to go time.
Dwight: Got it. Carb up.
Jim: Really? Power gel?
Dwight: Hey, you wanna win? You gotta fuel like a winner.
sAndy: Okay. We start. As soon as I make... this shot. Aaannnddd go!
Dwight: Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute. 
Jim: What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
Dwight: Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
Jim: What?
Pam: He's going through a break-up.
Jim: Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person.
Andy: [blowing air horn] Yeah!
Dwight: Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
Pam: What kind of prank are you thinking?
 
Dwight: What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure. I'll hold.
DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] Who am I?
DwightKSchrute: [on monitor] You tell me.
Jim: [dictating to Pam] Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
DwightKSchrute: [on monitor] How do I know this isn't Jim?
DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] What is a Jim?
 
Dwight: It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
 
Michael: Okay.
Pam: Yes it's too tight.
Kelly: Waaay too tight.
Michael: Really?
Oscar: This is why I'm here?
Kelly: Why is it so tight?
Michael: It's the European cut.
Angela: Is just looks bad.
Michael: Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging?
Tech Guy: Setting up the web-cam for the party.
Michael: Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
Kelly: Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
Michael: I had um, one of those danishes.
Pam: Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. 
Kelly: You had carbs? That's awful.
Pam: Uh, just one second. We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available. It's Jan.
 
Michael: Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun.
Jan: [on phone] My friends? Michael, I was terminated.
Michael: Just... 
Jan: Is it really that important to you?
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: Alright.
Michael: Thank you.
Jan: Go by yourself.
Michael: Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser. 
Jan: Well... 
Michael: Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
Jan: What? No Michael!
Michael: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
 
Dwight: Ohhhhhh!
Andy: Website check please.
Meredith: Three hundred and five.
Andy: Three-oh-five. You my friend are winning handsomely.
Meredith: Oop. It just made another sale. Three eighty.
Andy: You my friend are in a very close second.
Meredith: Four-oh-two.
Andy: Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?
Meredith: What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
 
Michael: So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.
Jim: Sure we'll go.
Michael: Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
Jim: Oh I'm sorry. What?
Pam: One of the tickets is for him.
Michael: Just let me know who the winner is.
Pam and Jim: Not it.
Jim: Nope.
Pam: I won.
Jim: Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.
Pam: Tie goes to the girlfriend.
 
Dwight: No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]
Jim: How's it going?
Dwight: Fine. Good.
Jim: Yeah?
Dwight: Yeah.
Jim: You look a little worried.
Dwight: I do not look worried.
DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] You do look worried.
DwightKSchrute: [on monitor] Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read... 
Pam: Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one. 
Jim: Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper. 
 
Angela: I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons. These are worthless.
Phyllis: I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
Angela: Phyllis. These are spoooons. Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top. And we need knives, which have blades. Do you understand me now?
Phyllis: Yes.
Angela: Goodie.
 
Jim: Hey man.
Darryl: What's up man?
Jim: What's going on?
Darryl: Make a delivery.
Jim: Oh yeah?
Darryl: Kelly ordered this online.
 
Dwight: What are you doing? I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
Kelly: But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, "Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin."
Dwight: Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did! 
Darryl: Who knows?
Dwight: Return it! Return it now! 
Darryl: Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
Dwight: Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
Darryl: Who's it?
Darryl: Here you go.
Kelly: Thanks.
Darryl: So you still missing Ryan?
Kelly: Not so much anymore.
Darryl: Mmmmm.
 
Dwight: I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them.
 
Dwight: Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good.
 
Michael: Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.
Jim: I'm driving?
Michael: Yes. Thank you.
Jim: Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Michael: Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you. [kissing noise, kissing noise] I love ya Pam... okay. [singing] I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
Angela: Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
Michael: If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.
Dwight: Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples.
Dwight: I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?
 
Dwight: Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
Andy: No ! [blows air horn and dances]
Dwight: Huh?!
Angela: Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
Dwight: Did you see the board?
Angela: There's still an hour.
 
Michael: You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham]
Jim: Yep. A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Michael: Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured... 
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Same sort of stuff in here. 
Jim: It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.
Michael: Mmwa. Mmwa.
Jim: What was that?
Michael: Leaving Pennsylvania.
Jim: Oh. Two kisses.
Michael: One for me one for Jan.
Jim: Gotcha.
Michael: You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?
Jim: That would be fun.
Michael: Wanna come over Friday?
Jim: Uhhh. Can't.
Michael: After work you guys... 
Jim: Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Michael: Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So... 
Jim: Mmmkay... 
Michael: What are you doing?
Jim: Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Michael: No.
Jim: Yep.
Michael: No, I'm sure that's not. Na... 
Jim: Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Michael: Yes.
Jim: Yep.
 
Michael: Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan.
 
Michael: You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
 
Michael: Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
Jim: Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
Michael: Yeah. I withdrew too.
 
Andy: Four! Three! Two! One!
Dwight: Yes!
Andy: Woo!
Dwight: Woo!
Andy: After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
Dwight: Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again.
Andy: Fifty-two reams!
Dwight: No no no the first part.
Andy: Dwight has defeated the computer.
Dwight: Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you.
Angela: I didn't ask you to do it for me.
Dwight: You didn't have to.
 
Angela: How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
 
Angela: Hello, Pam.
Pam: Hello.
Angela: Hey. Do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man.
Pam: Um... uh... I'll get back to you.
Angela: Let me know.
 
DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] You beat me. You are the superior being.
 
Michael: Alright who wants to party?
Oscar: Why aren't you in New York?
Michael: Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
Stanley: You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
Michael: I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
Angela: Thank you.
Michael: Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?
Andy: He beat the computer.
Michael: Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.
 
Michael: This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.
 
Michael: How we doing on time?
Angela: The party starts in an hour.
Michael: Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Angela: Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting? 
Michael: Mmmhmm.
Angela: Something made of ice?
Michael: Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel. 
Angela: Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
Michael: I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important... 
Angela: Chocolates? Someone famous? 
Michael: Yes
Angela: Cool music. 
Michael: Uh... 
Angela: Confetti. 
Michael: I want it... 
Angela: Go-Go dancers?
Michael: I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"
Angela: I can't do this.
Michael: Yes you can.
Angela: I can't do it.
Michael: Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?
Angels: Okay. Okay.
Michael: No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!
 
Andy: What do you think of Angela?
Dwight: I think she's efficient.
Andy: No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N.
Dwight: I hadn't noticed.
Andy: You hadn't noticed she's a woman?
Dwight: [impatient sigh]
Andy: I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right?
Dwight: I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
Andy: Isn't that part of the fun?
Dwight: No. I think you should date Kelly.
Andy: She works here too, how is that any different?
Dwight: Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby.
Andy: [raised eyebrows] Okay.
 
Michael: Good news.
Stanley: We get to go home?
Michael: Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
All: [murmurs of approval]
Kevin: Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe? Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Michael: Same thing.
Kevin: No, no.
All: [disagreeing with Michael]
Michael: You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
Kevin: Oscar, talk to him.
Oscar: Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from?
Michael: Pizza by Alfredo.
All: [shouts of disapproval]
Michael: Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
All: Medium amount of good pizza.
Michael: [sighs, walks back into office]
 
Kevin: Oh no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
 
Phyllis: You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
Angela: It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
Phyllis: [Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
Angela: Ow!
 
Phyllis: That seemed to shut her up.
 
Andy: Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box. [Camera pans to Kevin giving an "are you kidding me?" look]
Andy: Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
Andy: Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?
Angela: What?
Andy: Hello.
Angela: I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice. And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
 
Andy: They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
 
Michael: Yup.
Pam: The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
Michael: You don't have to say it like that.
Pam: I said it normal.
Michael: Hey
Pizza guy: Hey. Sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.
Michael: Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
Pizza guy: The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.
Michael: Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
Pizza guy: I don't care what you told them on the phone, that's our policy.
Michael: You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
Oscar: It's not pizza.
Michael: Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.
Pizza guy: [shrugs]
Michael: [sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?
Pizza guy: Not my problem.
Michael: It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story.
Pizza guy: Great story. It's sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.
Michael: I'm not giving that to you.
Pizza guy: Well then you're not getting you're pizzas.
Michael: No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out.
Pizza guy: What?
Michael: You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room.
Pizza guy: I'm not going in there.
Michael: Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you.
Pizza guy: This is stupid.
Michael: No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here.
 
Stanley: You find anything?
Kevin: We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.
Oscar: Stanley, could you look up "accomplices"?
Stanley: Why can't you guys do it?
Oscar: Because we're looking up jail time.
Stanley: Fine.
 
Dwight: I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
 
Pizza guy: Yeah, I know that guy. He's that farmer that grows really crappy weed.
 
Michael: You ready to give me my discount now?
Pizza guy: No.
Michael: Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
Pizza guy: What kind of business is this?
Dwight: We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Michael: Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man.
Pizza guy: You better think about what you're doing.
Michael: No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
Pizza guy: Sales?
Michael: Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales.
Pizza guy: You're such a loser.
Dwight: What did you just call him?
Pizza guy: A loser.
Dwight: What did you say?
Pizza guy: A loser.
Michael: Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
Dwight: I can make him talk, Michael.
All: Michael, Michael
Michael: Stop talking all at once!
 
Jim: You need to let him go.
Michael: Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
Jim: Yes.
Michael: You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
Jim: Yes, but not by kidnapping.
Michael: I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.
Jim: As a hostage.
Michael: I think you're over-thinking it.
Jim: I think you're under-thinking it.
Michael: Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
Jim: Ransom.
Michael: Trouble. Okay, alright.
Jim: What did he say?
Michael: He said no.
Jim: So, we should let him go.
Michael: No, no.
Jim: Okay.
 
Dwight: Listen up kid. [pops balloon with his hands] I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
Angela: I have to hang these.
Pizza guy: Why are you looking at her like that?
Dwight: Hey!
 
Kevin: What's going on?
Jim: Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Michael: Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?
Kevin: We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
 
Angela: I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
Meredith: I think it looks good.
Angela: That's why you're not in charge Meredith.
Andy: Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
Angela: How did you, um, where did you...
Dwight: It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
Angela: Will you help me put it over there?
Andy: Yes I will.
Angela: Okay.
Andy: Excuse me.
 
Andy: I stole it!
 
Oscar: Thank God.
Pam: Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
Michael: I'll just wave and introduce myself.
Jim: Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
Pam: I'm all over it.
Jim: Okay.
Jim: What have we got here?
Kevin: Good pizza.
Jim: Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Kevin: Different stuff.
Jim: Which one's this? Perfect.
 
Jim: Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
Pam: Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
Jim: And that's when I knew. You?
Pam: You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.
Jim: That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Pam: Yep.
Jim: Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Pam: Nope.
 
Manager: Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start.
Ryan: And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Michael: Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.
Ryan: Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear.
Pizza guy: If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor.
 
Angela: Ow! What are you doing?
Andy: You said your upper back itched.
Angela: I didn't ask you to scratch it.
Andy: Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.
Angela: I'm not dating you.
 
Andy: So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.
Dwight: [smiles]
Andy: But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.
Dwight: [kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
 
Michael: Hey, have you seen Jim?
Kevin: I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
Dwight: Ahh-chaa!
Michael: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Dwight: I'm just scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
Pizza guy: I can hear you, man.
Dwight: Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
Michael: Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid.
Dwight: You had to, what other choice did you have?
Michael: I could have paid for the pizza.
Dwight: Well, yeah.
Michael: Oh my God, oh my God.
 
Michael: This is Michael.
Ryan: Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
Michael: You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
Ryan: Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
Michael: [to Dwight] Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
Dwight: What will you do?
Michael: I will open the door.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
Dwight: So, I'm paying full price?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more.
Michael: See ya, drive safely.
Michael: [pizza guy flips him off] Okay.
Dwight: Now what?
Michael: Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
Dwight: Alright. Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Michael: Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.
 
Jim: A toast, better make it good. To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Pam: Ah-ha.
 
Andy: [answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second. Hello, hang on.
Andy: [Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I'll be first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me let me know, gonna be around. If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down. If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me. Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try. Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela. Take a chance on me.
Voice #1 on phone: Hey how'd it go?
Voice #2 on phone: Yeah, what'd she say?
Andy: I don't know yet, I have to call you back.
Voice #1 on phone: You have to give us something...
Andy: I'll call you back.
Angela: I have to go clean up after the party.
 
Michael: What a horrible day.
Dwight: Blah.
Michael: Bluh.
Dwight: Uhh.
Michael: Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what?
Dwight: What?
Michael: I'm going to get it.
Dwight: Coopers has calamari.
Michael: Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
Dwight: Tokyo?
Michael: New York. Wanna go?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: Alright, you drive.
Dwight: Okay.
 
Dwight: Nice.
Michael: Here we go.
Dwight: Woo-hoo.
Michael: Mmm.
Dwight: Yum.
Bartender: I'm sorry, you guys are going to have to leave.
Michael: Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let's go.
Man: Hey, you're the Scranton guy.
Michael: Guilty.
Man: I liked your statement tonight.
Michael: Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer.
Man: Oh, very cool. It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.
Michael: Yeah.
Man: See you later.
Dwight: Later on.
Michael: [mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face.
Dwight: And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Michael: I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
Dwight: I started a fire with my cheese pita.
Michael: I made it with my cheese pita.
Dwight: I date Indian girls.
Michael: I started a fire, I started a fire.
Dwight: Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
Michael: And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...
Dwight: I don't get that, I don't understand that.
Michael: Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.
Michael: Wanna head back?
Dwight: Yeah, let's go.
 
Ryan: [steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]

Michael: Coat! [throws coat at Pam]
 
Pam: Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
 
Michael: Steak! Where's my steeaaak?
 
Pam: He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
 
Michael: Get me Armani.
Pam: A suit?
Michael: On the phone.
Pam: Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
Michael: Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter]
 
Michael: I owe you an apology.
Pam: You finished the movie.
Michael: Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
Pam: No. Go ahead.
Michael: Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.
 
Pam: Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
 
Micahel: So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes. 
Jan: You do.
Michael: I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
Jan: Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
Michael: We already have a sofa. So why do---
Jan: A futon's not a sofa.
Michael: It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
Jan: I know what a futon is, Michael.
Michael: I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
Jan: It costs what it costs.
Michae: No--- don't... that doesn't even mean anything.
Jan: We have gone through this.
 
Michael: Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
 
Michael: It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- [phone rings]
Pam: [on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.
Jan: Conniving little runt. Put him through. 
Michael: Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!
Ryan: [on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
Michael: Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
Ryan: I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Michael: Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
Ryan: Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
Michael: [looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
 
Jim: [talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.
Dwight: [picks up phone] Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
Jim: Hey Dwight.
Dwight: None of your business, Jim.
Jim: Do you run the bed and breakfest?
Dwight: It is not a B and B.
 
Dwight: Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
 
Jim: Does the Department of Health know about this?
Dwight: I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
Pam: Hello, I'm looking for a room.
Dwight: Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones. 
Pam: It says here you cater to the eldery.
Dwight: Where did you read that?
Pam: Trip Advsior.
 
Dwight: Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
 
Dwight: How many in your party?
Pam: Two?
Dwight: We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
 
Jan: So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
Michael: Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
Jan: Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
 
Michael: Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.
 
Dwight: One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
Angela: What about my cherub figurine?
Dwight: You took that with you.
Angela: No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
Dwight: You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
Angela: Fine.
 
Dwight: My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
 
Kevin: The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
Michael: You can not, I have a thing tonight.
Kevin: Dammit.
Jim: Uh, Michael.
Michael: What?
Jim: That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
Michael: Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
Jim: Darn it!
Pam: Shoot!
Michael: How about this weekend?
Jim: No, can't.
Pam: We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
Michael: Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
Jim: Where are you going out tonight?
Michael: You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
Jim: I wouldn't understand or a secret?
Pam: You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.
 
Michael: I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy.
 
Jim: I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
Pam: The Beets Motel.
Jim: The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
Pam: Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
Jim: How are you doing this?
Pam: I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]
Pam: Oh my gosh.
 
Michael: I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
Nick: What's going on here?
Michael: Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call. 
Nick: We're a legit operation with a license from the city I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commision---
Michael: No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
 
Dwight: We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
Pam: What are the themes?
Dwight: American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
Pam: Irrigation.
Jim: Nice.
Dwight: I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
Jim: Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Dwight: No.
Jim: Not even Harry Potter?
Dwight: No. Jim, come on.
Mose: But you promised.
Dwight: Mose, bags! Now!
 
Dwight: Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
 
Nick: Everybody in the conference room. In 5 minutes.
Michael: These meetings are useless.
 
Nick: I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Improving the work. So, make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it?
Michael: Very inspirational. [laughter]
Nick: We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales. Ok.
Co-Worker 1: Or a woman.
Michael: Or a trained seal. [laughter]
Nick: You could make jokes when you've made a sale there rookie, ok? [laughter ends]
 
Jim: Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.
Pam: What?
Jim: Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
 
Jim: You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
Dwight: Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
 
Michael: Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?
Stanely: [on the phone] Yes, who is this?
Michael: I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
Stanely: Michael?
Michael: ...Stanley?
Stanley: Why are you calling me here at home?
Michael: [Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your---
Stanley: Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
Michael: [speaking with a different voice] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
Stanley: Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
 
Stanley: [on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
 
Michael: Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
Nick: [hangs up phone] My office.
Michael: You bet.
 
Nick: Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don't know why we have to keep on having this conversation.
Michael: Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
Nick: A few more minutes is a waste of our time.
Michael: It is not a waste of our time.
Nick: This is a trading game.
Micael: No.
Nick: You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That's how Vikram does it.
Michael: Vikram doesn't have my people skills. 
Nick: Good for Vikram, because he out-sells you every night.
Michael: Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
 
Dwight: [reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. "Harry?" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
 
Michael: What did you get tonight?
Vikram: Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.
Michael: Oh, that looks good.
Vikram: Oh, and what about you? Peanut butter flavor again?
Michael: I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
Vikram: Enjoy.
Michael: Thank you.
 
Vikram: I was a surgeon back home.
Michael: Really?
Vikram: Oh yeah.
Michael: Wonder what I would've been back home?
Vikram: Well this is your home.
Michael: I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
Vikram: Uhh, no.
Michael: I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
 
Jim: [Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
Pam: Yeah. Coward.
 
Pam: [Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
 
Michael: You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.
Co-Worker 2: Dude, you should review movies. [other co-workers agree]
Michael: I actually wrote a movie. 
Co-Worker 3: Really?
Michael: I'm writing one, yeah.
Co-Worker 3: What's it about?
Michael: Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
Nick: What's so captivating? [everyone stops talking, go back to work] I like captivating things. And this must be really captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean time is your money, that's how I know how captivating it is. Because how much time you spend talking.
 
Pam: [Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.
Dwight: [Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
Jim: Hey Dwight.
Dwight: Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
Jim: Does Mose have nightmares?
Jim: Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
Dwight: Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
Jim: Yeah, yeah.
Dwight: Great. 
Jim: Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
Dwight: Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
Jim: Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
 
Co-Worker 2: Yeah, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. Do you wanna come?
Co-Worker 3: We'd love for you to come, Michael.
Michael: Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.
Co-Worker 2: All right, next time dude.
Michael: Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?
Jan: You drive, I had too much wine.
Michael: Okay. How's yoga?
Jan: I didn't go.
Michael: Wh-Why not?
Jan: I just didn't!
Michael: Okay.
Jan: How was improv?
Michael: Good night Vikram.
Vikram: Good night.
Michael: Hey, congrats on the bonus.
Vikram: Thank you Michael.
Michael: I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
Vikram: Well if you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah.
Michael: Good night.
Vikram: Good night.
 
Pam: Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?
Dwight: Pam.
Jim: You okay?
Dwight: I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]
Ryan: Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
 
Ryan: Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
Michael: Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.
Ryan: Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
Michael: Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
 
Michael: Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery. 
 
Michael: And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes. 
Ryan: Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
Michael: Why?
Ryan: You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
Michael: No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
Ryan: I'm your boss.
Michael: My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
Ryan: You have another job?
Michael: What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
Jim: Are you a cocktail waitress?
Ryan: You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
Michael: It won't.
Ryan: It did, all ready.
Michael: Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]
Kelly: You're so funny.
Ryan: Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
Kelly: I invited him.
Ryan: It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
Darryl: There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this. 
Kelly: Okay. [makes out with Darryl]
Darryl: Hey, get off.
Kelly: Umm, see you later tonight.
Darryl: I have plans later.
Kelly: Okay, bye honey.
Ryan: How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
Michael: Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
Ryan: You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever. 
Michael: Huh, okay.
Ryan: What?
Michael: It's whoever, not whomever.
Ryan: No, it's whomever.
Michael: No, whomever is never actually right.
Jim: No, sometimes its right.
Creed: Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
Andy: No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
Oscar: Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
Michael: Not a native speaker.
Kevin: I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
Ryan: Do you really know which one is correct?
Kevin: I don't know.
Pam: It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
Phyllis: Yeah, that sounds right.
Michael: Well it sounds right, but is it?
Stanley: How did Ryan use it? As an object?
Ryan: As an object.
Kelly: Ryan used me an object.
Stanley: Is he right about that?
Pam: How did he use it again?
Toby: It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
Michael: Thank you.
Toby: To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
Michael: No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
Ryan: Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here. 
 
Michael: I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history.
 
Michael: Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs. One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---
Mr. Figaro: Lipophedrine
Michael: And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
Mr. Figaro: Never heard of it.
Michael: In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this.
Mr. Figaro: Are you quitting?
Michael: I am.
Mr. Figaro: Come back anytime, don't forget to disinfect your headset.
 
Michael: I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
 
Andy: So.
Pam: What's up?
Andy: Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
Pam: You're being gross.
Andy: Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.
Pam: What moves?
Andy: I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
Pam: I can't believe that's not working.
Andy: Yeah.
Pam: Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.
Andy: Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
Pam: She's very religious.
Andy: Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
Pam: Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
Andy: Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
Pam: That's right, you did.
Andy: Yeah.
 
Pam: Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
 
Michael: Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right? A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
Kevin: I do gamble Michael.
Michael: Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?
Kevin: The mob.
Michael: Do you know anybody in the mob?
Kevin: [shakes head no]
Michael: Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.
 
Kelly: What do you mean you have plans tonight?
Darryl: I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
Kelly: Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
Darryl: My daughter.
Kelly: Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
Darryl: That was cold.
Kelly: [makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
 
Phyllis: He's always been terrible with money.
Stanley: I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
Kevin: Yeah, women be shoppin'.
Meredith: I can't believe he has a second job.
Oscar: He's not even good at his first one.
Michael: Hey guys.
Kevin: Shh.
Michael: What'cha talking about? [camera pans to each face in the break room] Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---
Pam: Michael.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey.
Oscar: Michael, are you having money problems?
Michael: Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?
Oscar: You heard me correctly.
Michael: Oh, I hate monkeys.
Pam: What's going on, why do you have a second job?
Michael: I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
Pam: Doesn't Jan have money?
Michael: I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual.
Kevin: True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
Michael: I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]
Oscar and Stanley: You just put it back in your pocket.
Michael: Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
 
Darryl: Hey, let's call this what it is.
 
Darryl: It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
 
Kelly: Well, I just need to know where this is going.
Darryl: Hey, I like you. Oh yeah, what's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
Kelly: Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
Darryl: Slow down, think it over.
 
Kelly: Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?
 
Creed: Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.
Michael: No you didn't.
Creed: Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
 
Creed: Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
 
Michael: How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
Creed: You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up "get out of jail free" cards, those things cost thousands.
Michael: That is a good point.
Creed: Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
Michael: Like the witness protection program.
Creed: Exactly.
Oscar: Not at all.
 
Michael: I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life.
 
Michael: I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!
 
Oscar: Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Michael: I didn't say it, I declared it.
Oscar: Still, that's not anything.
 
Oscar: This is a lot of credit card debt.
Michael: Yeah, tell me about it.
Oscar: Mmm.
Michael: You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
Oscar: Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
Michael: Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
Oscar: Twelve hundred dollars. What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Michael: That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core.
 
Andy: I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game.
 
Oscar: Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
Michael: Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
Oscar: The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
Michael: Right.
Oscar: This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
Michael: How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?
 
Pam: Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background] Angela.
 
Oscar: Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
Michael: No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
Oscar: She has to know.
Michael: We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
Oscar: Michael, this is a presentation tool.
Michael: You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
Oscar: I'm done!
Michael: No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half. 
Oscar: Jan is smart.
Michael: She poses.
 
Jim: Dwight, how's the hotel business?
Dwight: Stupid.
Jim: Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
Dwight: No.
Jim: Maybe you should.
Dwight: Maybe you should. Whatever.
 
Pam: We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
Jim: The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
Pam: Table making never seemed so possible.
Jim: You will never want to leave your room.
Pam: The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
 
Dwight: I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
Pam: We really did. It was fun.
 
Oscar: So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
Jan: [on phone] You're broke?
Michael: Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?
Jan: [on phone] Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say.
Oscar: Jan.
Jan: [on phone] Yeah, what?
Oscar: Michael left.
Jan: [on phone] Okay, where did he go?
Oscar: I don't know.
Jan: [on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
Oscar: I don't think so.
Jan: [on phone] I'll be right there.
 
Michael: What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
 
Angela: [to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood. 
 
Pam: Dwight.
 
Dwight: Uhh-mmm [moaning]
Jim: Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
Dwight: [incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.
Jim: Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam.
Dwight: Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling]
Jim: Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
Dwight: [sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
 
Pam: Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]
Jim: Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Yeah?
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Okay.
 
Pam: Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
 
Jim: Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
 
Oscar: Jan, he went running that way.
Jan: Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar]
 
Michael: [singing] Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back.
Jan: Michael.
Michael: Hey Jan.
Jan: What's going on?
Michael: Not much, what's up with you?
Jan: Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going?
Michael: I'm out of answers Jan.
Jan: What does that mean?
Michael: I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you.
Jan: Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything. You know that.
Michael: I don't know that.
Jan: Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
Michael: I'll stay off the grid.
Jan: Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad.
Michael: Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up.
Jan: Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
Michael: That's really nice of you to say.
Jan: Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So, where's this train taking us?
Michael: I think the engineer left.
 
Dwight: [takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
 
Michael: Don't sell your implants please.
Jan: I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
Michael: That's nice though.
Jan: It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
Michael: It looks cute though.

Michael: Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!
Phyllis: Dancing babies!
Michael: Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
 
Michael: We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby.
 
Andy: Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the "Kit Kat theme song"] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
Jim: Nobody tell him!
Andy: What? No, why?
Jim: You got it, you're so close!
Andy: [singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
Jim: Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
Andy: Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
Jim: Nope.
Andy: Football cream. Grr!
Michael: Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
Pam: I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
Michael: Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
 
Michael: Hello hello!
Ad guy 1: Hey, how ya doin'?
Michael: Michael Scott.
Ad guy 2: Hey, Michael.
Michael: Regional manager.
Ad guy 2: Hey Michael, nice to meet you
Michael: Excited to talk ideas.
Ad guy 1: Let's do it, man.
Michael: You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
Ad guy 1: That sounds great.
 
Michael: All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
Michael: I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out? 
Andy: Hoo hoo hoo-hoo! 
Michael: He gives the best back rubs in the office.
Andy: It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!
Michael: Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
Stanley: Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
Michael: Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima. 
Michael: These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
Kevin: [looking at Oscar] Mama Bear!
Michael: Who else?
 
Jim: I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
 
Jim: You playing that game again?
Dwight: Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
Jim: Oh it has losers.
 
Dwight: I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
 
Michael: [reading off piece of paper] Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison. But we zoom back further---
Ad guy 1: Okay I can tell that your time is valuable---
Michael: Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
Ad guy 1: That all sounds really, really ambitious.
Michael: Yeah, I know.
Ad guy 1: Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?
Michael: Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]
Michael: That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.
Ad guy 1: That's what we came up with.
Michael: Well we can do better than that.
Ad guy 2: Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually.
Ad guy 1: Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we have some leeway.
Michael: The waving? 
Ad guy 1: Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.
 
Andy: I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
Dwight: We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us. 
Andy: We'll use code names.
Dwight: Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
Andy: That's not different enough.
Dwight: Dwike?
 
Receptionist: You have a call from Eddie Murphy.
Ryan: Hello?
Michael: [on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry. 
Ryan: What?
Michael: Okay, calm down. I have a small problem. 
Ryan: I told you not to call about small problems.
Michael: Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
Ryan: That's good. They're creative, you're not. 
Michael: I'm creative, Ryan.
Ryan: It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
Michael: Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
Ryan: Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
Michael: Yeah! 
Ryan: But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
Michael: Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
 
Michael: All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.
 
Michael: Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
Ad guy 2: Okay, when should we come back?
Michael: How about never hundred hours, sir.
Ad guy 2: We were sent here to help out.
Ad guy 1: Okay I'm not going to argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck dude. 
Michael: Hey thanks. Thank you. 
 
David Wallace: [on phone] Michael, David Wallace. What is this about dismissing the ad people?
Michael: Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
Ryan: I'm on Michael. 
Michael: What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.
David Wallace: This is weird.
Michael: I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
David Wallace: Okay, I'll see it tomorrow. 
Michael: Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way. 
 
Michael: Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative"?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with. 
Jim: Who are you talking to, specifically?
 
Kevin: I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
 
Oscar: When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
 
Meredith: I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
 
Michael: We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously. Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.
 
Phyllis: [gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
Michael: Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
Phyllis: Okay.
Andy: Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
Creed: She's crazy hot.
Andy: Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
Angela: That's not happening.
 
Angela: I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
 
Phyllis: Bye everyone.
Michael: Line it up Phyllis.
Creed: Get her Phyll.
 
Darryl: [singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly, Darryl: Call Michael or Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs.
Darryl: Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Darryl: Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Michael: Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
Darryl: What's rap?
Michael: Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix. 
Darryl: Great. 
 
Andy: News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
 
Jim: Hey.
Pam: No talk, I'm animating.
Jim: Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality. 
Pam: Are you serious?
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: Oh my God, he's really in pain. 
Jim: [sighs]
Pam: Who's that?
Jim: Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.
Pam: He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Jim: Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so--- 
Pam: Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too. 
Jim: Yep.
Pam: You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
Jim: I... why don't we go back to this animation.
Pam: No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
Jim: Ah, show me how this works.
Pam: Oh boy.
 
Darryl: [singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Darryl: Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Michael: Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
Darryl: You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Michael: No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible. 
Darryl: You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
Michael: Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
Darryl: You just said you hated it. 
Michael: No. I said I hate the, the style.
 
Andy: [singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
Michael: Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
Andy: Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
Michael: Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
Phyllis: [crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
Michael: That'a girl.
Phyllis: So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends. 
Michael: Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton? 
Phyllis: [sobbing] No.
Michael: Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]
 
Jim: I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one. 
Pam: Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
Jim: Okay. Do you want me to stay?
Pam: No no, you can go home. I'm good.
 
Jim: Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
Meredith: You comin'?
Jim: I, ah...
Meredith: Piss or get off the pot! 
 
Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Jim: Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
Pam: Thank you.
Jim: You're welcome.
 
Pam: I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide. 
 
Andy: Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night. 
Dwight: Andy, I can't hear this right now.
Andy: No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, "Oh D, oh D." 
Dwight: She called you D?
Andy: Yeah. D for Andy.
Dwight: Oh D. 
Andy: Oh D.
Dwight: [whispers] Oh D. 
Andy: Oh D!
Both: Ohhhhhh D! [laughing] Ohhhh D!
 
Michael: I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone] 
Pam: [on phone] Yes?
Michael: Pam, please clear my phone lines.
Pam: Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear. 
Michael: They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God...I better call.
 
Michael: [Ten days later] Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
 
Everyone: [watching ad] Oh! [clapping and cheering]
Bartender: Hey it seemed like a big hit.
Michael: No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real. 
 
Jim: Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player? 
 
Jim: Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it. 
 
Michael's Ad: [Chariots of Fire theme plays] It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up. [people passing a Corporate Memo around to each other] Because ideas spread, they change, grow. They connect us with the world. [Kelly catches paper airplane that says "I love you"] And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time [newspaper with Andy saying "Hometown Boy Wins Race"], and bad news isn't always what it seems. [Dwight hands Phyllis paper that says "You have a son, and it's me"] Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance. [Stanley finds paper that says "Turn your life around. Now hiring at Dunder Mifflin"] To score. [Jim throws paper in basket, Michael retrieves it; it says "World's Most Creative Boss"] Dunder Mifflin. Limitless paper in a paperless world.
 
Everyone: [claps and cheer]
Jim: Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
Bartender: Really?
Jim: I just thought you should---
Bartender: The animation was cool. 
Pam: Thanks.
Bartender: Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle?
Jim: Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam]
 
Kevin: Michael, that was fun.
Michael: That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
 
Andy: [singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It's gotta rhyme with "piece." Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it. 

Rolando: [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Rolando. Oh yes, she's been expecting your call. [knocks on door]
Karen: Yeah.
Rolando: Karen? He's on line one.
Karen: Thanks Ro. Hey, we finally connected. How's Scranton?
 
Karen: I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch. Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
 
Karen: Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard. So think about it, okay? Okay, bye.
 
Karen: Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
 
Michael: This is perfect.
Dwight: He looks like your twin.
Michael: This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
Dwight: I will know.
Michael: But, you will not tell anyone.
Dwight: I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah.
Michael: Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. [knock on the door] Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
Stanley: I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
Michael: Just go out, and come back in.
Stanley: I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
Michael: What?
 
Michael: Hey everyone, can I have your attention please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
All: [applause]
Michael: No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
Jim: Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
Michael: Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
Stanley: I think it's because of my sales record.
Michael: That could not possibly be it.
 
Michael: You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.
 
Michael: How can I get you to stay?
Stanley: Money.
Michael: Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.
Stanley: Money.
Michael: Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-
Stanley: Money.
Michael: Pssh, kay.
 
Pam: Oscar, did you bring it?
Oscar: To be Edwardian. His best work.
Pam: Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
Oscar: Sure thing Pam, can't wait.
 
Pam: Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive.
 
Oscar: Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
 
Jim: So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
Pam: Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Jim: Oscar?
Pam: Some people.
 
Karen: [on phone] Hello?
Michael: Fillipellers, how's it hanging? 
Karen: Michael... 
Michael: To the left?
Karen: Listen, I-
Michael: To the right?
Karen: I'm-
Michael: Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
Karen: You called me.
Michael: Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
Karen: I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
Michael: No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby.
Karen: Toby's not a salesperson.
Michael: You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um... Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.
Karen: Oooh. Good-bye Michael.
Michael: Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one? [Karen hangs up]
 
Pam: I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
Michael: Hi Ben, Michael Scott.
Ben: Hi Michael.
Michael: I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
Ben: Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car?
Pam: [giggles]
Michael: [to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.
Ben: Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden. Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?
Michael: No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
Ben: Seriously?
 
Michael: What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House.
 
Dwight: Found him!
Michael: Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
Jim: So what are you going to do?
Michael: What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples.
Jim: Did they?
Michael: Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?
Pam: It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.
Michael: That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words.
 
Jim: We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
Michael: What? What? We did?
Dwight and Michael: Surprise! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Michael: Look at his face! Look at his face!
Jim: What are we doing?
Dwight: Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
Michael: What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
Dwight: Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
Michael: We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.
Jim: We're going to Utica?
Michael: Uh-huh.
Jim: I'm not going to Utica right now.
Michael: Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim.
Jim: No.
Michael: We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
Michael and Dwight: [chanting] Utica! Utica! Utica!
 
Michael and Dwight: [chanting] Utica! Utica!
Michael: In your face
Dwight: Yow!
Jim: I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Michael: Are you calling Karen?
Jim: No, I'm not calling Karen.
Dwight: He's lying.
Michael: Yep, get it.
Jim: What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
Dwight: [throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
Jim: Are you kidding me?
Dwight: No communication with the outside world Jim.
Michael: It had to be done, it had to be done.
Jim: Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Dwight: Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot.
 
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Hey Dwight, he found it.
Jim: You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Michael: Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.
Jim: Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?
Michael: Do you really wanna know?
Jim: Oh, God. [hangs up phone]
Michael: Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
Dwight: Or real bombs.
Michael: No, no, not real bombs.
Dwight: Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
Michael: Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
Jim: No.
Michael: It could be badass. Yeah, it will.
Jim: No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Dwight: Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
Jim: Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
Michael: Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
 
Jim: So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache.
 
Michael: So, why did you and Karen break up? Was it the sex?
Jim: What?
Michael: I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...
Jim: Okay, you know what?
Michael: ...awesome.
Jim: Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Michael: Okay, I will start. Um, "A." [singing] "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell? Um...
Jim: It doesn't matter.
Michael: I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
Jim: Doesn't matter.
Michael: Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound... The air-conditioning leaking or something?
Jim: That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
Michael: What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?
Dwight: I'm peeing in this empty can.
Jim: Oh my God!
Michael: Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
Dwight: Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
Jim: Michael, watch the road!
Dwight: Hey, you're making me spray!
Michael: I'll kill you man!
Jim: Michael! Michael, pull over!
Michael: That is just so disgusting!
Jim: Pull over, pull over!
Dwight: I think I cut my penis on the lid!
 
Oscar: Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
Toby: I know right? I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
Pam: And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?
Andy: [joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
Oscar: What are you doing?
Andy: Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.
Pam: Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
 
Andy: The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.
 
Andy: Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading.
Toby: Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.
Andy: Why can't I be in the club?
 
Jim: I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
Dwight: Believe it.
Michael: Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
Jim: No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car.
Michael: Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I-
Jim: Guy's going by. Shh.
Michael: You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
Dwight: And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
Jim: No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
Dwight: Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Jim: Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
Dwight: Okay, Jim.
Jim: Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Dwight: Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
Jim: Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
 
Pam: I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention.
Kevin: Damn it!
Pam: It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine] To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
Oscar: Yes.
Kevin: Damn it! [banging machine]
Pam: Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
Oscar: Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
Pam: Very brave choice also, I thought.
Oscar: And George, his- his youthfulness. His, um, freedom. [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um... What are you microwaving!?
Phyllis: Popcorn.
Pam: Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
Phyllis: Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn.
 
Andy: So, Stanley, are you really outta here?
Stanley: Yep, looks that way.
Andy: I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me. Like a kind old uncle Remus. I wanna stay in touch.
 
Michael: [from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell.
Dwight: [from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
Dwight: I'm breathing heavily.
Jim: Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
Dwight: Well...
Michael: There's a guy, there's a guy.
Dwight: There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?
Michael: Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
Dwight: I can see the security guard's eyes.
Jim: No, no, don't do anything to them.
Dwight: I have to do something to his eyes.
 
Dwight: The eyes are the groin of the head.
 
Jim: Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
Michael: We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier.
Jim: Isn't that thing huge?
Michael: It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
Jim: No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Michael: Aha! [crashing]
Dwight: My hip bone!
Michael: We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us.
Dwight: Don't leave us!
Michael: Save yourself!
Dwight: Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Jim: Okay! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all-
Michael: Dwight, you gotta move!
Jim: Damn it guys!
Michael: Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
Dwight: I'm losing control of my bladder.
Jim: Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
Dwight: Did you say Karen?
Michael: Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
Jim: No, I'm not doing that.
Michael: Just say you wanna get back together.
Jim: No, I'm not doing that!
Michael: It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
Karen: Jim?
Jim: Hey Karen.
 
Karen: Uh, what are you doing here?
Jim: First of all, hi.
Karen: What are you doing here?
Jim: You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
Dwight: Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Jim: Copy that.
 
Karen: I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
 
Karen: Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
Dwight: Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
Karen: I'm taking Stanley.
Dwight: Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
Michael: [whispers] Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave]
Karen: Jim, hang on a second?
Jim: Yes?
Karen: So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
Jim: Yeah, trying to quit though.
Karen: If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
Jim: Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you...
Karen: [huffs]
Jim: I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
Karen: Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
Jim: [slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
Karen: Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
Jim: I... will... [gives up and walks away]
 
Michael: We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free. Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.
 
Michael: Um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass. Big butt, bigger heart. [knock on the door] I can't do this.
Stanley: Michael? A word?
Michael: Of course.
Stanley: I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
Michael: Really?
 
Stanley: I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did Michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
 
Jim: Hey.
Pam: I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility.
Jim: Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
Pam: [nods head yes]
Andy: Oh-oh, come on!
 
Jim: [Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
Oscar: Okay, did you get it out of your system.
Jim: Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read.
Toby: Fun?
Jim: Mm-hmm.
Toby: Really?
Jim: Yeah.
Toby: What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins?
Jim: No, that wasn't fun.
Toby: Did you even read it?
Jim: Of course I read it.
Oscar: How does it end?
Toby: Who was the main character?
Jim: Angela. Nope. The ashes.
Pam: [mouths "I'm sorry" to Oscar]

Toby: I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
Meredith: I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen. 
Toby: Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]
Michael: Morning.
Toby: Michael. 
 
Pam: Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him. 
 
Pam: Did you sleep in cabins?
Toby: Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come. 
Phyllis: Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
 
Phyllis: Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited. 
 
Pam: Who went?
Toby: Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, "No more s'mores, no more s'mores." [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]
 
Toby: Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]
Michael: [from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
Toby: Michael wasn't invited. 
 
Michael: Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real.
Jim: Got it.
Michael: So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go? 
Jim: Absolutely, yes. 
 
Jim: When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes. 
 
Michael: Really?
Jim: Yeah?
Michael: Oh, you wanna go today?
 
Jim: And I am always busy.
 
Jim: Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood. 
Michael: How often can you actually donate blood?
Jim: Is there a limit?
Michael: Your body only has a certain amount. 
Jim: Well, is that it? Or?
Michael: Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame. 
Jim: How so?
Michael: A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]
Jim: What's that?
Michael: Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
Jim: Right.
Michael: In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
Jim: Not gonna change.
Michael: I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
Jim: I thought we had that looked at.
Michael: I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
 
Michael: When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "Survivorman." And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
 
Michael: OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
Dwight: [winks] I'm on it. [leaves room]
Michael: OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what... 
Dwight: Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk]
Michael: Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.
 
Dwight: I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place." Well I say, "It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose."
 
Michael: Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day. 
Pam: Do you want me to ask where you're going?
Michael: No.
Pam: Great.
Michael: Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
Pam: Oh.
Michael: Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours. 
Jim: Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this? 
Michael: Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me. 
Jim: OK, great.
Michael: This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I. 
Jim: Yup.
Michael: When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
Jim: That'd be great.
 
Dwight: Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.
 
Michael: This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead. 
Dwight: No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
Michael: Well, yes I would. And I would survive. 
Dwight: I would make sure that you were dead.
Michael: Well...
Dwight: First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified. 
Michael: You...
Dwight: And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Michael: You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.
Dwight: What are you doing? 
Michael: I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?
Dwight: It would be better if you were unconscious.
Michael: No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
Dwight: Do you want to do this right or not?
Michael: Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
 
Angela: Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday. 
Jim: Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?
Angela: Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember? 
Jim: I do remember, yeah.
Angela: It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
Jim: You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
Angela: What?
 
Jim: There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
 
Michael: [flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
 
Jim: And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to "Happy Birthday." And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
 
Michael: [flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday! 
Kelly: Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding] 
 
Michael: [flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday! 
Oscar: Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs]
 
Michael: [flashback to Phyllis' birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis' car] Happy Birthday!
Phyllis: Oh! [Michael laughs]
 
Jim: So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
 
Jim: We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
Angela: I don't like it. [Angela leaves]
Pam: Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?
Jim: It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
Pam: Do you think it's a good idea?
Jim: No... I think it's a great idea.
Pam: [smiles] Hmm.
 
Dwight: We're here. [gets out of the car]
Michael: Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. 
Dwight: [leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
 
Dwight: Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
 
Dwight: Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it. 
 
Jim: You know, try sending them another invoice.
Oscar: Ok. 
Jim: Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way? 
Oscar: [picks up and reads memo] "Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today." This is really cool.
Jim: Right? I was just thinking...
Oscar: No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. 
Jim: Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
 
Dwight: Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
Michael: What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
Dwight: I'm just --
Michael: Stop. 
Dwight: Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold. 
Michael: Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight: Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape. 
Michael: Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug] 
Dwight: Good luck, Michael.
Michael: Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off]
 
Meredith: Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake? 
Jim: What's that?
Meredith: I really prefer devils food cake.
Jim: Oh, sure. 
Meredith: Yes!
Jim: OK. [Meredith leaves]
Pam: Wow! That was easy. 
Jim: Yeah, people like me I guess.
Creed: [knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
 
Creed: I hate devils food.
Jim: Well I think Meredith was just --
Creed: Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday. 
Jim: Everybody's birthday. 
Creed: Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
Jim: What do you want?
Creed: I want pie. I want peach pie.
Jim: You want a birthday pie?
Creed: I want a nice cobbler.
Jim: Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
Creed: I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
Jim: It will be Angela. 
Creed: You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
 
Michael: [to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...
 
Dwight: I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
 
Michael: There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck]. 
 
Michael: I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat] 
 
Michael: See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.
 
Michael: Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable. 
 
Andy: Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk]
Jim: Andy. 
Andy: Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
Jim: Not your birthday.
Andy: Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
Jim: Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
Andy: Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.
Jim: Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Andy: Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk]
Jim: Alright. [Andy rolls back]
Andy: Pizza rolls. 
Jim: OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
Andy: Mushroom caps.
 
Michael: I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter. 
 
Dwight: Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch. 
 
Michael: Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
 
Dwight: About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].
 
Michael: I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. [singing] Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.
 
Meredith: What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them? 
Kevin: Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
Stanley: I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
Oscar: Why don't you just have an apple?
Stanley: Why don't you mind your business?
Creed: Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care. 
Oscar: Probably went to his head. 
Creed: Yeah. [Jim enters room]
Oscar: Hey, Jim. 
Jim: Hey guys, what're we talking about?
Creed: Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
 
Michael: Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day. 
 
Dwight: Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.
 
Toby: [knocks] Hey Jim. 
Jim: Toby.
Toby: Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
Jim: Oh, thanks man. 
Toby: Yeah...
Jim: Is there anything --
Toby: My birthday was two months ago. 
Jim: Oh, OK.
Toby: There was no party. 
Jim: What?
Toby: Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
Jim: I remember that.
Toby: I don't know, I just thought you could include me.
Jim: Seriously?
Toby: I just though you could add me. I don't see the harm in that.
 
Jim: Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
 
Jim: OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
Angela: No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
Toby: I'm allergic to mushrooms. 
Jim: That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing. 
Pam: [raises hand] Conference room?
Jim: Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it. 
Angela: What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
Kevin: Oh, I'll take 'em. 
Creed: Well nobody's touching my cobbler. 
Phyllis: [raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.
 
Jim: Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact. 
 
Michael: Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth] 
Dwight: Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth] 
 
Everybody: Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday [Michael joins in with high note] to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. [Creed blows up candles on pie] 
Michael: Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.
 
Michael: Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. [shows off computer screen scenery] I can also make it the sky.
 
Michael: Hey, buddy.
Jim: Hey.
Michael: What up? 
Jim: Sure glad you're back. 
Michael: You are relieved.
Jim: You have no idea. 
Michael: So what did I miss?
Jim: Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
Michael: Oh.
Jim: So, terrible idea.
Michael: Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. 
Jim: You did do it?
Michael: Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
Jim: Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
Michael: That's what I said. That's what she said.
Jim: That's what who said?
Michael: I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
Jim: That's what she said.
Michael: Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.

Oscar: So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
Michael: I'll call back.
Kevin: You never call back.
 
Pam: Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
 
Michael: [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that says "Good Morning"] Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.
 
Jan: [laughing]
Michael: You can't always work 200 days though.
Michael: [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed]
 
Ryan: You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
Michael: Yep.
Ryan: I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying "Hiya Buddy"]
Michael: Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
Ryan: Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
Michael: N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.
Ryan: Take the call, friend.
Michael: I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
Ryan: I insist you take your work calls. 
Michael: Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy.
 
Jan: I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
Michael: Yeah, I hate that.
Jan: Good.
Michael: So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
Jan: And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior. 
Michael: Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.
Jan: Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
Michael: Well-
Jan: Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior. 
Michael: Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
Jan: Does this work for you? 
Michael: Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
Jan: Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky. 
Michael: Million dollars!
Jan: Four million.
Michael: Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
Jan: No, Michael. Oh, come on.
Michael: Perfect crime.
Jan: Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment. 
Michael: Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good. 
Jan: Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
Michael: I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.
Jan: All right, fine, just a second. Hold on. 
 
Michael: Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
Lester: A good start. And I think it's busload.
Michael: Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
Ryan: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey hey. 
Ryan: I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second. 
 
Ryan: Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Michael: I would love that.
Ryan: Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
Michael: Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company. 
Ryan: Good. That is great to hear. 
Michael: It is.
 
Darryl: [playing ping-pong] Game, son!
Jim: All right, let's run it back. 
 
Pam: The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12. 
 
Kelly: What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
Pam: Hi, Kelly. 
Kelly: Guess whose boyfriend it is?
Pam: I don't wanna guess.
Kelly: I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].
 
Kelly: I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
 
Pam: Jim. Can I see you for a second?
Jim: Sure. 
 
Jim: Wow.
Pam: Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl. 
Jim: Oh, I can't beat Darryl. 
Pam: Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
Jim: What, seriously? What is she saying?
 
Kelly: [flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
 
Kelly: [flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
 
Kelly: [flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong? 
 
Jim: So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
Pam: Sorta, yes.
Jim: Bring me players.
Pam: Okay. 
 
Diane Kelly: Hi everyone, I'm Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel. 
Michael: Hi. [Michael sees Toby] No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
Diane: Toby?
Michael: Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
Toby: Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
Michael: Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
Jan: Michael, just relax, okay?
Diane: You know, I think they're, uh ready for us now. So..
Michael: Okay. All right.
 
Deposition Reporter: Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Michael: Yessh.
Lester: Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination? 
Michael: Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior. 
Lester: Oh. Very good. Well put. 
 
Jan: People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
 
Pam: Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you. 
Kevin: About what?
Pam: He needs help balancing some travel receipts. 
Kevin: Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts. 
Pam: Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room. 
Kevin: [enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts "Meeting in Progress" sign on the door]
 
Lester: How long have you known the plaintiff?
Michael: I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
Lester: How long have you known Ms. Levinson?
Michael: Six years and two months. 
Lester: And you were directly under her the entire time?
Michael: That's what she said.
Lester: Excuse me?
Michael: That's what she said.
Lester: Ms. Levinson told you she was your direct superior?
Michael: Uh, wh-why would she say that?
Jan: Can we just move on to another question?
Diane: No wait, I don't understand. Who's on record on saying this? 
Lester: With all due respect, I'm in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position.
Michael: Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
Jan: Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
Lester: Oh, are you sure? 
Jan: Uh, yes.
Lester: Can you go back to where this digression began? 
Deposition Reporter: [reading off paper] Mr. Schneider: And you were directly under her the entire time? Mr. Scott: That's what she said. 
Michael: Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it. 
 
Kelly: [Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought. 
 
Lester: Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired? 
Michael: She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them. 
Lester: Can you be more specific? Who are the twins? 
Michael: Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.
Lester: You don't need to go any further. Her breasts.
Michael: Yes. 
Lester: She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery?
Michael: Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant. 
Lester: What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination?
Michael: Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
Lester: Interesting. How so? 
Michael: Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. [makes a gasping sound] 
Diane: Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, if that's okay with you?
Michael: I will allow it.
Diane: Um would you mind please just, uh, taking a quick look at, uh, this photograph please. [Diane hands Michael the photo of Jan and Michael in Jamaica]
Michael: Uh...
Diane: That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica, is that correct? 
Michael: Uh-huh. 
Diane: And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the timeline here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin? 
Michael: Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define "begin". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago. 
Diane: Wait, excuse me? 
Michael: If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that. 
Lester: Could we take a short break? 
Diane: No, uh, are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here? 
Michael: Line.
Diane: I'm sorry, what?
Man: He asked for a line, like in a play.
 
Deposition Reporter: [reading off paper] "Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?" "I did?" "Yes you did." "Can I go to the bathroom?" "No." "I really have to, I've been drinking lots of water." "You went five minutes ago." "That wasn't to go to the bathroom, that was to get out of a question." "You still have to answer it." "First can I go to the bathroom?" "No."
 
Jim: Good game Meredith.
Meredith: Don't patronize me.
Dwight: All right! What is going on here?
Jim: Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
 
Jim: [Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Dwight: I told you.
 
Dwight: All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J�rg Ro�kopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
 
Michael: Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
Diane Kelly: Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know.
Lester: Wait, we'd like to enter to the record a page from Michael Scott's personal journal.
Michael: Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
Lester: This is plaintiff's exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year. "Just got back from Jamaica. Tan almost everywhere. Jan almost everywhere. Hehe. Oh diary, what a week. I had sex with my boss. I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere, that it was a one time mistake. But we had sex six times so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie."
Michael: Irie.
Lester: Irie, sorry. "More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael." It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct?
Diane Kelly: We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
Michael: I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
Diane Kelly: It's basic discovery. We have the right to review it.
Man: OK, let's make ten copies of this diary.
Toby: Um, can you make it eleven?
Man: Eleven, sure. And we'll break for lunch, so everyone can have a look.
 
Michael: [looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here?
Toby: [nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... [Michael pushes Toby's food tray off the table and walks off]
 
Michael: How can you give up my diary like that?
Jan: I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
Michael: How'd you even find it?
Jan: You keep it under my side of the mattress.
Michael: I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
Jan: Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
Michael: Fine. I love you.
Jan: I love you too.
 
Diane Kelly: [looking at a copy of Michael's diary] Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as "Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way."
Michael: Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
Lester: Aren't we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not Michael and this Ryan person.
Toby: [laughs out loud] Excuse me.
Michael: Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
Diane Kelly: OK Mr. Scott, it's, it's admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you.
Michael: Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
Diane Kelly: Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.
Michael: That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot... [Jan glares at Michael] ...of water.
Diane Kelly: Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind, uh, reading the date on that please? [slides the performance review towards Michael]
Michael: March 17th.
Diane Kelly: And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?
Michael: Yes.
Diane Kelly: You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if you'd like to.
Michael: [reading the performance review] "I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."
Diane Kelly: Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?
Michael: [stares at Diane, eyes tearing up]
Diane Kelly: Mr. Scott?
 
Pam: [walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?
Dwight: Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
Jim: Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
Pam: Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
Jim: I think I'm ready.
Pam: I'll make the call.
Dwight: Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
Jim: ...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores]
 
Michael: How can you do that to me?
Jan: [looks at Lester]
Lester: You can respond, just remember it's all going into the record.
Jan: Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
Michael: Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
Jan: Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
Lester: Starting at paragraph 6. Council: "Mr. Wallace, regarding Michael Scott, was he a contender to replace Jan Levinson?" David Wallace: "Yes."
Michael: See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
Lester: Council: "Was he your first choice?" David Wallace: "Michael Scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years."
Council: "Was he in the top 5 of contenders?" David Wallace: "What do you want me to say? Come on, he's a nice guy. There were many people that I considered." Council: "Was he seriously being considered for the corporate job?" David Wallace: "No."
Lester: I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees?
Michael: ...Absolutely not.
 
Pam: [watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that?
Kelly: Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
Darryl: 19, serving 4. [serves and scores]
Kelly: Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
Pam: You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!
Kelly: What?
Pam: Let's go. Pick up a paddle.
Kelly: OK. Bring it on.
Pam: I am.
Kelly: Think you can handle this?
Pam: In my sleep.
Kelly: OK. Volley for serve, P. [serves]
Pam: O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] [serves] P.
Kelly: O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]
Jim: Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
Darryl: Yes.
 
David: Michael. I am very sorry.
Michael: Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
David Wallace: No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
Michael: [nods and shakes hands with David Wallace] Hey, David?
David: Yeah?
Michael: I think you're a nice guy too.
David: Thanks, Michael.
 
Michael: Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.
 
Michael: [Driving with Jan in the car] What do you want to do for dinner?
Jan: How about Chinese?
Michael: Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
Jan: That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
Michael: Do you fast food?
Jan: Fine, fast food's fine.

Stanley: This is ridiculous.
Phyllis: Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
Michael: Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight?
Jim: Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
Michael: Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! [on phone] This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! [hangs up] Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
Dwight: Thank you Michael.
Michael: All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
Jim: I think you did.
Michael: I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
Jim: Oh, I-
Michael: You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
 
Jim: Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
 
Dwight: Michael, what time should I be arriving?
Michael: Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
Andy: Hey-o!
 
Dwight: Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying]
 
Jan: Hi.
Michael: Hello.
Jim: Hi.
Jan: How are you?
Michael: Come on in. Good to see you.
Jan: Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
Michael: Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
Jim: Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
Michael: Yeah.
Jim: I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Michael: Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
Jim: Really?
Michael: Except driving.
Pam: We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
Jan: Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
Michael: Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
Pam: It's really nice.
Jan: So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
Jim: Tour, let's do the tour first.
Michael: Okay.
Jan: Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
Michael: Totally your call babe.
Jan: Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
Jim: Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
Michael: Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
Jan: Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
Michael: Well, thats...
 
Jan: This is my office.
Michael: Yep, never been used.
Jan: Not super exciting.
Michael: No.
Jan: And this is my workspace.
Michael: This is it, check that out, can you smell that? [the room is filled with candles that say "Serenity by Jan"]
Pam: Uh-huh.
Michael: As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
Pam: So you have an office and a workspace?
Jan: I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.
Jim: It's fire.
Jan: Uh-huh, Bonfire.
Michael: Bond.
Jan: Men love this one.
Michael: James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue]
Jan: When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
Jim: Just like that.
Jan: Just like that.
Jan: So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
Michael: Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
Jan: [puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Michael: Well, I-
Jan: Shame on you.
Pam: What a cute bench.
Michael: Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
Jim: Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
Michael: It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down]
Jan: See, he fits perfectly.
 
Michael: I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. [reveals a tiny TV] I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? [moves TV back a couple inches] Voila, right in the wall.
Jim: Wow.
Michael: Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
Jim: What is that chestnut?
Michael: No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
Jan: It's pine.
Jim: Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Jan: Really?
Pam: Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
Michael: If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
Jan: I bet you are.
Jim: Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
Jan: It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said "Honey keep the trophies."
Michael: Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
Jan: [doorbell] Oh, excuse us just a second.
Michael: I'll get it.
Jan: [Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.
Angela: [Michael tries to hug Angela] No, no.
Michael: Okay.
Andy: Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]
Jan: Oh, how thoughtful.
Michael: Very nice.
Andy: Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
Jan: Aw.
Angela: What am I supposed to do with this?
Jan: How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
Pam: Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Jan: Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
Pam: Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
Jan: You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
Michael: When in Rome.
Jan: Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
Michael: Whatever you say babe.
Jan: Follow me.
Michael: All right.
 
Michael: How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.
All: Cheers.
Michael: Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
Jim: What was that?
Jan: So music, should we turn some music?
Michael: Yeah that sounds good.
Jan: Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
Hunter's CD: You took me by the hand, Made me a man, That one night, You made everything all right, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah.
Michael: You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
Jan: Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
Angela: Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
 
Pam: [To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
 
Andy: [playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
Jan: Joe Camel!
Andy: Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
Pam: Montana.
Jan: Oh!
Pam: Joe Montana!
Andy: Yes! Yes.
Pam: Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?
Michael: All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
Jan: Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
Michae: What, no, I'm just making people laugh.
Jan: No.
Michael: Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
Jan: I was watching Jim.
Michael: And he was laughing.
Jan: No smiling.
Michael: Look at him, he's laughing.
 
Jim: Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
 
Jim: You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Pam: Oh okay.
Michael: Well you don't need two of you to do that.
Jim: That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
Pam: Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself. 
Jim: I don't know because I everything I own is there.
Pam: You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
Michael: That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
Andy: Michael, you're up.
Michael: All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
Jan: No no no, no names, no names, no rhyming, no soundalikes.
Michael: All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
Angela: I don't know.
Jim: Katie Holmes.
Michael: No, Baah! But he's married to her!
Jim: Oh, Dawson's Creek.
Michael: No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
Jan: No rhyming!
Jim: Not really a rhyme.
Angela: Another clue, another clue.
Michael: Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
Angela: Those aren't helpful.
Jim: Tom Cruise!
Michael: No!
Andy: Time!
Michael: God, does anybody read the paper?!
 
Pam: [Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.
Michael: You're welcome.
Jan: [eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here. The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
Michael: I don't like that story babe.
Jan: Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
Michael: Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
Jan: You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
Michael: Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!
Angela: You shouldn't joke about that.
Pam: Is there more wine in the kitchen?
Jan: I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
 
Jan: [checking the oven] Uh, not even close.
Angela: So you keep a very tidy house.
Jan: You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
Pam: No, yeah. What?
Jan: Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Pam: Oh, are you joking?
Jan: Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
Pam: I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
Angela: I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
Jan: Mmhmm.
 
Michael: [in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
Jim: Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Michael: Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
Andy: Thought about it, I'm in.
Jim: I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
Michael: I'm sorry. [doorbell rings] What now?
 
Jan: Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
Dwight: Hello.
Jan: What are you doing here?
Dwight: We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
Pam: [whispering] Awesome.
Jan: What is he doing here?
Angela: Yes, What are you doing here?
Michael: Dwight is my friend.
Woman: We weren't invited?
Michael: You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
Jan: Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
Michael: Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
Jan: We saw Wicked.
Michael: When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
Jan: I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay? But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.
Michael: Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away]
Jan: I hate my life.
Dwight: So can we come in?
 
Dwight: Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
Jan: [crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
Dwight: Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
Angela: I hate beet salad.
Woman: It's actually really good.
Dwight: Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
Angela: The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
Michael: [leans across to Pam whispering] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
Pam: [whispers] Like... like what?
Michael: I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe.
Andy: Yeah it does.
 
Pam: I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
 
Jan: [Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
Michael: You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
Jan: Oops.
Michael: Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table]
Jim: [to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
Woman: I was his babysitter.
Pam: And now you guys are dating?
Dwight: Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
Jim: Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Woman: E-mail?
Jim: Nevermind.
Michael: Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay.
Jim: That's nice.
Michael: Everybody enjoying their meal?
Jan: Hey babe?
Michael: Yeah?
Jan: How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Michael: No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
Jan: Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud]
Michael: [to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
Jan: At least he's an artist.
Michael: BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
Jan: [shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
Michael: NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
Jan: FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
Michael: MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
Jan: YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
Michael: OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
Jan: AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!
Michael: [yells] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [Jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up Michael's dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv] THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! [Jan goes upstairs crying.]
Woman: I'm gonna get going.
Dwight: Fine. Get outta here.
Jim: It's getting late.
Michael: You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.
 
Jim: [Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
Dwight: Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
Officer 1: Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?
Michael: Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
Officer 2: The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
Michael: Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
Officer 1: You wanna press charges?
Michael: Would she get into trouble?
Officer: Yes. She'd be charged.
Michael: I will take the fall. I did it.
Officer 2: You know you don't have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet.
Jan: [running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
Officer 1: Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here?
Dwight: [puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.
Michael: Jim? Pam?
Jim: Oh... my apartment's on fire
Pam: [whispers] Flooded.
Jim: Flooded.
Dwight: You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me. 
Michael: No.
Dwight: I'm gonna take you home Michael.
Michael: Nope.
Dwight: Alright. [leads Michael away]
Jan: Bye Babe!
 
Pam: [Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.
Jim: You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Pam: Hmm?
Jim: [holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
 
Pam: [Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...
 
[Cut to Michael holding his head out of Dwight's car]
 
[Cut to Andy and Angela in Andy's car eating Ice cream. Andy tries to steal a bite of Angela's. She rolls down the window and smashes it against his car]
 
[Jan is watching Michael's cracked plasma screen TV and tries to fix his Dundie.]
 
[Michael and Dwight slow at a red light and see the woman at the bus stop, she waves to Dwight, who passes her by.]

Pam: W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
Jim: So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Pam: Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
Jim: Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
Pam: Nature.
 
Oscar: Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
Andy: I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar. 
 
Kevin: [sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed. 
 
Pam: Some of us like the walk more than others. 
Kevin: [off screen] Hurts like hell. 
 
Pam: [to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
Michael: Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair. 
Pam: But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
 
Pam: Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it. 
 
Michael: [holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman? 
Pam: Her? 
Michael: Hmm...
Pam: The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair? 
Michael: Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
Pam: Or in a great chair. 
Michael: Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
Pam: I definitely remember your dinner party. 
Michael: I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands. 
Pam: Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
 
Michael: What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
 
Michael: Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]
Creed: [on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?
Pam: [on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet. 
Creed: [on phone] Daat!
 
Creed: When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go. 
 
Michael: I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all. 
 
Andy: I left my cell phone in my car. 
Phyllis: Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
 
Michael: [to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up? 
Kevin: If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself. 
Michael: I thought that you were engaged? 
Kevin: Nope. Stacy broke up with me. 
Michael: Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends? 
Kevin: Not anymore. 
Michael: Oh...
Kevin: It's a bitter situation. 
Michael: Yeah... ugh. She's... [gets up and leaves] you don't deserve her. Alright. 
 
Michael: [sitting on Oscar's desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...
Phyllis: Michael?
Michael: What? 
Phyllis: I have a friend who's single. 
Michael: Oh.
Phyllis: Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
Michael: Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer? 
Phyllis: Umm, no, she's a professional softball player. 
Michael: Oooo. Catcher or in field?
Phyllis: Umm I don't know Michael.
Michael: Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
Phyllis: What are you asking?
Michael: I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question. 
Phyllis: No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat. 
Michael: Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK! 
 
Michael: What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry. 
 
Michael: Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes. 
Angela: I don't think that this is---
Michael: Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired. 
Dwight: [gets up from chair] Write legibly people. 
 
Andy: Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
Michael: Hmm..
Andy: It's like a ten minute walk.
Kevin: No, thirty.
Michael: Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad. 
Kevin: Yes.
Andy: Yes.
Michael: That would be bad.
Andy: OK.
Kevin: Nice.
Andy: ...So help us out. 
Michael: Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.
Kevin: Michael, please he--
Michael: What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves. 
Andy: We won't let you down. 
Michael: Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael's office] don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards. 
 
Stanley: There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card. 
Phyllis: Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it. 
Pam: [to Jim] Who are you putting down? 
Jim: Oh, you don't know her. 
Pam: Who is it? 
Jim: Your mom. 
Pam: Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me. 
 
Michael: Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. [Michael dials phone number. Phone rings.] 
Wendy's phone operator: Wendy's.
Michael: Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael. 
Wendy's phone operator: This isn't Wendy.
Michael: Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?
Wendy's phone operator: Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant. 
Michael: [under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
Wendy's phone operator: You have to come to the restaurant to order food. 
Michael: Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready. 
Wendy's phone operator: It's ready now. 
Michael: Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah.
Dwight: OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Michael: Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
Dwight: I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit. 
Michael: That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go. 
 
Dwight: [on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed. 
 
Dwight: The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed. 
 
Michael: She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young. 
Dwight: She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died. 
Michael: Oh, God. Oh...
Dwight: Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah. 
Jim: Michael, you didn't even know her.
Michael: Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
Dwight: Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
Michael: Please, not at a time like this. [sighs]
Pam: OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you. 
Michael: Oh really? What's her name? Burger King? 
Pam: No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]
Michael: I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?
 
Pam: I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
 
Michael: No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again. 
 
Kevin: We need to assemble the five families. 
Michael: [while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families.
Kevin: We have to. 
 
Kevin: The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him "Cool Guy Paul." W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean. 
 
Michael: [still brushing teeth] Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now. 
Kevin: [to Andy] I'm calling the meeting anyway.
 
Michael: [to cashier at coffee shop] Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette [cut to a blonde woman in a skirt]. Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. [woman walks right by and doesn't respond] 
Margaret: Michael? 
Michael: [turns around to see the woman from his description] Ugh.
Margaret: Are you Michael Scott? 
Michael: Is who a Michael what? 
Margaret: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm supposed to be meeting someone named Michael. 
Michael: Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...
Coffee shop worker: Michael? Michael? [reads cup] Large hot chocolate with caramel and a shot of peppermint. 
 
Michael: So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...
Margaret: You're asking what I do with the checks that people write to me? 
Michael: Just making conversation. 
 
Michael: Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us? 
Margaret: I don't know.
Michael: You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that. 
Margaret: She's beautiful. 
Michael: Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know. 
Jan [on phone]: Michael? Hello? Michael? [Michael hangs up phone]
Margaret: I'm gonna head out. 
Michael: Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus. 
Margaret: That's incredibly rude.
Michael: Now you ruined it. [gets up and leaves]
 
Bob Vance: Where's Scott?
Andy: Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement. 
W.B. Jones: Let's just meet back in an hour. 
Andy: Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
Kevin: [nervously stuttering] I... have... things...
W.B. Jones: Alright, what do you want?
Andy: Well first of all, I'd just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen. 
W.B. Jones: You have about ten seconds---
Kevin: We want our parking spaces back!
Paul Faust: Whose parking spaces?
Kevin: W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
Bill Cress: Ohh... God...
Paul: I don't have time for this you guys. [to W.B. Jones] Just give 'em back their spaces. 
W.B. Jones: OK. 
Paul: We good? OK. Could have done this over e-mail. 
 
Kevin: After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
 
Michael: Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me? 
Pam: She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along. 
Michael: Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...[walks away back to his office]
Jim: [walks up to reception] Margaret? 
Pam: I know.
Jim: You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
Pam: Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move. 
Jim: Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud. 
Pam: Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too. 
Jim: OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]
Pam: No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged. 
Jim: Have I not proposed to you, yet?
Pam: Hmm, I don't, know...
Jim: Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]
Pam: Oh, right now? 
Jim: No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame. 
Pam: OK, so then, when? 
Jim: Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works. 
Pam: Oh, right, yeah. 
Jim: Wait, I'm serious. It's happening. 
Pam: Ohh kay. 
Jim: And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp. 
Pam: I've been warned. 
 
Jim: I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating. 
 
Michael: I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs] 
Dwight: You know what you need? Closure. 
Michael: You're right. What do you mean though? 
Dwight: There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye. 
Michael: Hmm.
Dwight: Come on. I'll drive.
 
Kevin: We did it.
Andy: [at same time as Kevin] I did it.
Kevin: We got our spaces back. 
Oscar: Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin]
Pam: Nice job. 
Jim: Nice. [fist bumps Kevin]
Andy: Yeah, there it is. You're welcome. 
 
Andy: Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park. 
 
Michael: [looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?
Dwight: I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger. 
Michael: God.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: She was so innocent. 
Dwight: She was stoned apparently. 
Michael: You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do? 
Dwight: You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive. 
Michael: Oh, you move on. 
Dwight: Yeah. 
 
Jim: Where do you want to go for dinner?
Pam: I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...
Jim: Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe? 
Pam: [smiling] I hate you. [walks away]
Jim: What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
Pam: Oh, oh.
Jim: No, no, no.
Pam: How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
 
Michael: [singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die? 
 
Michael/Dwight: [singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
Michael: Return.
Dwight: Rhythm and blues...
Michael: This'll be [with Dwight] the day that I died.
Pam: What's wrong Michael?
Michael: I got gum in my hair.
Pam: You do.
Michael: This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
Dwight: You've got a ton of dandruff.
Michael: OK, let me be.
Jim: How'd you get gum in your hair?
Michael: I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
Jim: But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Michael: Kill me... right now.
Pam: We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
Michael: I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
Jim: Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Pam: No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.
 
Michael: Smells good.
Dwight: Taste good too.
Michael: Oh don't. That's disgusting.
Dwight: Wow! Lot of calories.
Michael: Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.
 
Dwight: Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
Michael: [sighs]
 
Michael: I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.
 
Oscar: I am livid, Absolutely livid.
Angela: It's ridiculous.
 
Ryan: Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
 
Ryan: My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
 
Jim: Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
Ryan: Love it. Go.
Jim: Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
Ryan: I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
Jim: Thanks.
Ryan: David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
Jim: Did I? I don't...
Ryan: You did. Yeah.
Jim: Hmm.
Ryan: Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
 
Michael: Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or...
Ryan: Ok thanks Michael.
Michael: Yeah.
Ryan: I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Dwight: Question.
Ryan: Dwight.
Dwight: Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
Ryan: This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Stanley: I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
Ryan: I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
Stanley: When will that be?
Ryan: TBD. Phyllis?
Phyllis: Did the police solve the problem with the...
Ryan: Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
 
Ryan: Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
 
Dwight: I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
Jim: Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
Ryan: It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
Jim: And then an older gentleman asked you "Boxers or briefs?"
Creed: I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.
Kelly: If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
Ryan: Do you have a question Kelly?
Kelly: Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Michael: [slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
 
Michael: Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
Ryan: You too.
Michael: Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan]
Ryan: Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Michael: Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
Ryan: Na.
Michael: Na?
Ryan: Sorry man.
Michael: Well you tried.
Ryan: But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Michael: Yeah.
Ryan: Unreal.
Michael: They sound great.
Ryan: Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
 
Michael: Would you have sex with Meredith?
Jim: What?
Michael: Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
Jim: I'm gonna go to my desk.
Michael: Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that...
Jim: I know.
Michael: Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
Jim: I can't.
Michael: Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.
Jim: I'm not single.
Michael: Who you dating?
Jim: Pam.
Michael: That's still going on?
 
Michael: Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
Dwight: Yeah!
Andy: Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
Angela: I'm right here.
Dwight: No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
Michael: Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
Angela: We get it.
Michael: I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
Dwight: [laughs] With sex!
Michael: That's... I, I think that...
 
Jim: You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
 
Jim: So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
 
Michael: Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
 
Michael: Place is packed.
Dwight: Fire hazard.
Michael: Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
Dwight: Women look like white slaves.
Michael: No, they're just hotties.
 
Ryan: I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
Michael: Hey.
Ryan: Michael.
Michael: Hey!
Ryan: What are you doing here?
Michael: Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
Ryan: That is so awesome man!
Michael: Alright!
Ryan: And you brought this guy!
Michael: Yeah.
Ryan: Aww!
Michael: Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight.
Ryan: I know it's you guys.
Michael: Ok.
Ryan: I'm so psyched you're here!
Michael: Well.
Ryan: Woooo!
Michael: Alright!
Ryan: Let's get a drink.
Michael: Let's do it!
 
Jim: Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
Kevin: Later.
Jim: Nice job everybody. Great work.
 
Stanley: Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
Jim: Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
Pam: You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
Stanley: Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
 
Pam: There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, "What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?" He said, "If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks."
 
Ryan: Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
Michael: Hey, nice to meet you.
Troy: Hey, how ya doing?
Dwight: Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
Ryan: Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Dwight: No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
Ryan: Bottle service ya'll?
Michael: Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
Waitress: We don't serve food here.
Michael: Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
Dwight: Do you live in a regular sized house?
Ryan: Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.
 
Jim: You really don't have his phone number?
Pam: I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
Toby: I might have it in here.
Pam: Aw! That's great Toby.
Toby: It's so random that I have it.
Pam: Toby, you're the best.
Toby: When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
Jim: Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
Toby: No.
Jim: It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
Andy: Yes, it's Eddie.
Jim: It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
Creed: Hank, his name is Hank.
Jim: No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
Phyllis: Elliot.
Oscar: Elliot!
Jim: Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
 
Ryan: Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?
Dwight: Good.
Ryan: This guy owns his own beet farm.
Troy: Insane.
Dwight: Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
Ryan: Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
Dwight: They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Ryan: Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
Dwight: You've already been several times.
Ryan: Yeah.
Dwight: Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
Ryan: I don't know, maybe.
Dwight: I'll order you some cranberry juice.
Ryan: With vodka, you're the best.
Dwight: [to troy] Do you have powers?
 
Jim: [on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Oscar: We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas. 
Toby: Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's.
Angela: Yeah, neither did I. 
Phyllis: Jim was supposed to collect it. 
Jim: Yup...
Kevin: Way to go, man.
Kelly: Now he's never gonna come. 
Andy: By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands]
Pam: Phyllis.
 
Michael: I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting "Back to the Future." "Back" because it's on my back and "Future" because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie. 
Girl in Club: I've never heard of that movie. 
Michael: Back to the Future? [she shakes head] Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course. 
Girl in Club: How old are you?
Michael: Forty... I'm in my forties. 
Girl in Club: Wow. That's so cool. 
Michael: Nuhh...
Girl in Club: Well I'm gonna go back to my group now.
Michael: Oh, OK. 
Girl in Club: Thanks for the drink.
Michael: You are welcome. 
 
Michael: This place is like sexy pre-school. 
Ryan: Did you want a place where we could meet older women? 
Michael: I would love a place where we could meet older girls. 
Ryan: Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
Michael: Ahh, wow. That's dangerous. 
 
Ryan: [to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard. 
Dwight: [to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me. 
Tall Girl #1: Yeah?
Dwight: [referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
Tall Girl #1: Uh, we're the Jersey State Varsity Basketball team. Northeast Regional Champs.
All Girls: Wooo!
Dwight: Amazons. 
Ryan: [to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks. 
Michael: You're kidding.
Ryan: Let's bail. [starts to leave]
Dwight: Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go. 
Tall Girl #2: We're not going unless we can all go. 
Dwight: OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go. 
 
Toby: Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw. 
Pam: I know how to throw a football. 
Toby: Course you do.
Andy: Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! [Pam throws football, hits Meredith's face]
Meredith: Owww!
Kevin: Oh God. 
 
Bartender: There you go.
Dwight: Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
Bartender: It's for you. From them. [points to Jersey State girls across the bar]
Dwight: Oh. [dumps drink out] 
Troy: What are you doing man?
Dwight: It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try. 
 
Michael: I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool. 
Girl in 2nd club: That's one aspect of small pet grooming. What do you do?
Michael: I am a bank teller. 
 
Michael: Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance. 
 
Girl in 2nd club: Cool. 
Michael: I think so.
Girl in 2nd club: Yeah. 
Michael: Yeah, I have fun. 
Girl in 2nd club: I'm just gonna just use the powder room.
Michael: All right. 
Girl in 2nd club: So I'll see ya soon. 
Michael: Very perfect. [girl walks away, Michael laughs] Oh my [notices Dwight making out with Tall Girl #1] This needs to be shared. [takes a picture with his camera phone] [Cut to the office - All Office co-workers cell phones go off. They notice the picture Michael has sent and all groan]
 
Michael: She washes dogs. 
Ryan: You're doing it man. 
Michael: I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom. 
Ryan: Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Michael: Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy]
Ryan: It's inevitable, right?
Michael: Hmm...
 
Jim: [on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
Hank: Hello?
Jim: Haaank. Is that you?
Hank: Yeah. 
Jim: Still haven't left the house yet, huh?
Hank: I'll get ready to leave. 
Jim: Good. Please hurry. 
Hank: [on phone] Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks!
Jim: Will do. [hangs up] I'll stop calling.
 
Michael: [on phonne] I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not... [Ryan is dancing feverishly and falls over] Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls. 
 
Pam: Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow. 
Oscar: Why?
Pam: I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]
Toby: More like "Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday." [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away]
 
Michael: [Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad. 
Ryan: Why wouldn't they let me dance? 
Michael: Well...
Troy: OK I gotta go. Do not take him to a hospital. [runs away]
Michael: Pretty weird. [Dwight and tall girl run out of club]
Tall Girl #1: [to Dwight] You have to go with me.
Dwight: I do, I have to go.
Tall Girl #1: Stay. Stay, please?
Dwight: No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
Tall Girl #1: Call me. 
Dwight: Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her. 
Michael: Let's go.
Ryan: I don't wanna go back in.
Michael: I know, here we go. 
 
Jim: [notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us. 
Oscar: Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
Jim: I... just... if they speak Spanish. 
Oscar: [to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK? 
Cleaning lady: Ohh...
Oscar: They happened to speak Spanish. 
Jim: Lucky us. 
 
Ryan: This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment]
Dwight: Wow. 
Michael: This is it. 
Dwight: All right. 
Michael: This is where the magic happens.
Dwight: Nice. 
Michael: Very nice. 
Ryan: One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Dwight: I got sofa. I got sofa. 
Michael: Dwight, I'm the boss.
Dwight: I got floor. 
Michael: Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on. 
Dwight: [to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
Ryan: No. [Dwight starts singing in German] 
Michael: Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone. 
Dwight: It's a lullaby. 
Michael: Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off. 
Ryan: No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
Dwight: I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours. 
Michael: Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it. 
Ryan: Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
Dwight: OK. Good night Ryan. 
Michael: Best night ever. 
 
Michael: Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys. 
 
Hank: [drives up to parking lot to notice all the office cars are gone] Son of a bitch. 

Michael: Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!
Pam: Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
Michael: Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
Kevin: Michael you could put your initials in it.
Michael: M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
Jim: Yeah that's true.
Michael: Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
Phyllis: We-- we--
Michael: Here we go!
Phyllis: Well--
Michael: Let's, yes?
Phyllis: When I was a little girl...
Michael: Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!
Phyllis: We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Michael: It's drying, it's drying...
Phyllis: In our neighborhood...
Michael: Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
Phyllis: What did we write?
Michael: Ahh come on!
Andy: Here it is, you should draw a picture...
Michael: No!
Andy: Cause that says, that says...
Michael: No!
Andy: So much more than words...
Michael: No!! Come on, gimme something good!
Kelly: Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Michael: Pam, translate.
Pam: She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
Michael: I love it!
Jim: If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Michael: I love it more!
Oscar: Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
Michael: I... love it!! Haha, come on!
Dwight: Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
 
Jim: We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
Michael: [with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please.
Jim: Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
Dwight: Can you breathe?
Jim: Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
Dwight: Hold your breath.
Jim: And in this case...
Dwight: Ready?
Jim: That's also not true.
Dwight: And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.
Michael: [muffled] That's what she said.
 
Michael: Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." I dunno, it's a good feeling.
 
Andy: [playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective...
Angela: Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
Andy: Good one. Okay, you ready?
Angela: Mmhmm.
Andy: [reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?"
Angela: [laughing] It's a man eating cat food.
Andy: What about a cat eating man food?
 
Dwight: Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
 
Pam: [wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
 
Michael: All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...
Pam: I don't have my contacts...
Michael: Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
 
Michael: Ener-gize...
Jim: You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Pam: Don't, don't--
Jim: Would...
Pam: If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
Jim: Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
Michael: Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
Andy: What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
Michael: Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
Jim: What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Michael: Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
Jim: An urban thing...
Michael: An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
Stanley: Not me.
Michael: Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
Stanley: No.
Michael: Stanley, we're havin a little...
Stanley: Leave me alone, dammit.
Michael: We're havin a little brainstorm session...
Stanley: DID I STUTTER?
Michael: ...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.
 
Toby: Can I talk to you a second?
Michael: Ugh, what?
Toby: Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
Michael: What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
Toby: Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.
Michael: That? In the conference room?
Toby: Yeah.
Michael: We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright?
Toby: He didn't seem like he was joking.
Michael: Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: "Hey um, you're poor." "Well hey, you're mama's dead." That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.
Toby: Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
Michael: Mmhmm.
Toby: Um, why don't you go ask him that?
Michael: Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
Toby: You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...
Michael: Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.
 
Andy: You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
 
Dwight: [kicks the car] Unh! Scratch.
Andy: That's a racing stripe.
Dwight: Uh, bumper's sagging.
Andy: Mmm, I doubt that very much.
Dwight: This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Andy: How next to?
Dwight: Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
Andy: I have to pick one of those?
Dwight: Yes.
Andy: Can you go over those options again?
Dwight: You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
Andy: Well I have the, the blue book value...
Dwight: Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
Andy: Can I think about it?
Dwight: Five, four, three, two...
Andy: Let me think about it--
Dwight: Now. Now. Now.
Andy: Let me think about it--
Dwight: Say it. Do it. Now.
Andy: I'm thinking about it--
Dwight: Do it now.
Andy: Thinking--
Dwight: Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Andy: Yeah. All right!
 
Stanley: What.
Michael: I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
Stanley: What are you talking about?
Michael: Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
Stanley: I am not going to apologize to you.
 
Stanley: It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
 
Dwight: Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
Michael: Uh huh...
Dwight: There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
Michael: Great
Dwight: However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
Michael: What's the pink?
Dwight: Menstrual cycles.
Michael: Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
Dwight: You.
Michael: Other than me.
Dwight: Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
Michael: I never said you could do that.
Dwight: All you have to do it say it.
Michael: I...
Dwight: Just say it.
Michael: Okay, I will think about it.
Dwight: Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
Michael: No.
Dwight: So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
 
Kevin: Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
Pam: Oh, thanks.
Kevin: All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
Pam: Oh, okay...
Kevin: Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
Pam: I should probably get back to...
Kevin: Like librarians.
Pam: Entering the....
Kevin: Could you just say, "these are due back Thursday"?
Pam: No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]
 
Creed: A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
 
Darryl: Mike.
Michael: Hey.
Darryl: I'm very busy here, man.
Michael: Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?
Darryl: Why?
Michael: It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...
Darryl: No, no, no...
Michael: I know, it's very, very personal...
Darryl: No, um... I have.
Michael: I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
Darryl: Both.
Michael: God.
Darryl: Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
Michael: Okay.
Darryl: Newsies.
Michael: Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
Darryl: Oh my goodness.
Michael: Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
Darryl: Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
Michael: What is that?
Darryl: That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
Michael: Really?
Darryl: Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
Michael: I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
Darryl: Well, it's effective.
 
Ryan: [to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
Jim: Oh boy...
Ryan: How do you live with a franchise this bad?
Jim: On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
Ryan: Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
Jim: A formal warning... [chuckles]
Ryan: It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Jim: [stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
Ryan: This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
Jim: I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
Ryan: Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
 
Toby: I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
 
Pam: Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?
Jim: Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
Pam: Because you're very important?
Jim: Yeah...
 
Dwight: [washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
 
Andy: What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit.
Dwight: It's my car now.
Andy: I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
Dwight: Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
 
Dwight: I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
 
Michael: Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
Pam: What does that mean?
Michael: It's like a mock execution.
Jim: That's not a good idea.
Michael: Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
Toby: Well, you can actually fire him.
Michael: No, okay... I've had enough of you.
Oscar: Why are you telling us this?
Michael: Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
Kevin: Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
Michael: I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. [Stanley enters the room] Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
 
Michael: Stanley Hudson, you are fired.
Stanley: Are you serious?
Michael: I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
Stanley: You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
Michael: Hmm.
Stanley: I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
Michael: Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
Stanley: So I'm not fired.
Michael: That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
Stanley: Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
Michael: Okay...
Stanley: Do you have any idea how to run an office?
Michael: Yes.
Stanley: Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
Michael: That's not-
Stanley: And I think, "there's no possible way--
Michael: All right, all right...
Stanley: He can top that."
Michael: Okay.
Stanley: But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
Michael: Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
Jim: Who?
Michael: Everybody, except Stanley.
Jim: Let's go.
Pam: I can't find my glasses.
Jim: Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
Pam: Okay, okay.
 
Kevin: [chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
 
Michael: [starts to cry] I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
Stanley: Oh, for the love of God.
Michael: You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.
Stanley: Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
Michael: Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
Stanley: Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
Michael: All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
Stanley: Fair enough.
 
Michael: I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, "I don't respect you!" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. [as Borat] Respect is niiice. Borat. [as Rodney Dangerfield] What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!
 
Michael: So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?
Stanley: Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
Phyllis: That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
Michael: Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.

Michael: Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!
Oscar: Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.] 
Michael: Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.
 
Michael: Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.
 
Darryl: Hey, are we doing this thing?
Michael: Yup.
Kelly: Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
Michael: Why are you dressed like that?
Darryl: [in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
Michael: Like you're applying for a loan.
Dwight: Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
Darryl: Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
Pam: [to Darryl] I think you look nice.
Michael and Darryl: [simultaneously] Thank you.
Michael: Okay, here's what we're going to do: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.
Darryl: What college did you go to Mike?
Michael: Let's go!
 
Jim: Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
 
Phil Maguire: [takes golf swing] Whoa!
Jim: Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
Phil Maguire: Hey Jim, how are you, nice to see you man.
Andy: Oh no! No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir. I am... totally and completely kidding! [they both laugh] Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95.
Phil Maguire: Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, '74 [goes to shake Andy's hand]
Andy: Oop, got some blisties.
Phil Maguire: Yeah, you do.
 
Andy: Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.
 
Phil: Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
Jim: Great!
Kevin: What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
 
Kevin: I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
 
Pam: So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
 
Michael: [Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think?
Darryl: Show them what you brought, Mike.
Pam: [holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought.
Michael: This is all we need.
Oscar: We'll see.
Michael: Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! [all four of them sit in an empty booth with small Dunder Mifflin sign] Hello!
 
Kevin: Andy, you're up, let's go! 
Andy: [gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this. 
 
Andy: People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my "knot" on.
 
Andy: [swings] Dammit!
 
Meredith: Guys, do we have to stay all day?
Phyllis: I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
Creed: Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
Dwight: Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
Phyllis: What consequences?
Dwight: I will tell on you.
 
Pam: There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
Justin: Cool.
Pam: [laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs. 
Michael: Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
Pam: This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.
Michael: Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest." 
Pam: He's nice and he seems interested.
Michael: He's totally wrong, Pam. [to Justin] Hey.
Justin: Hi.
Michael: How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. [takes back the info flyer Justin holds] Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby. 
Justin: Sorry for wasting your time.
Michael: Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
Darryl: Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
Pam: I only brought the one. 
Michael: Are you mental?
Pam: Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, "Are you sure Michael?" And you said "Pam! Pam! Pam!" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, "Don't worry, it's just allergies." Do you remember that?
Michael: I... don't.
Pam: Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves]
Michael: And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
 
Jim: Hey, so how's the direct mail business going? 
Phil: I can't complain, people love their junk mail.
Jim: Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
Phil: You know what Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don't we just play, okay?
Jim: Absolutely, will do.
 
Jim: So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
 
Michael: [teen approaches table] Hello there.
Kid: What is this company?
Michael: Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company... 
Oscar: Dunder Mifflin paper.
Kid: Thanks. [walks away]
Michael: Dammit, Oscar!
 
Michael: Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline!
 
Dwight: Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
Angela: Extension 128. 
Creed: [over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed.
Creed: Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in? 
Angela: No.
Creed: Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]
 
Pam: My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
 
Michael: [answers cell] What do you want?
Dwight: Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
Michael: Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
Dwight: So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-
 
Michael: Thank you! [Pam hands him blank paper] What, what is this?
Pam: A piece of paper.
Michael: This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
Pam: Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Michael: Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
Pam: Are you serious?
Michael: Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
Pam: Okay. 
 
Phil: Oh! [Phil is stuck in the sand trap] Ah, dammit!
Jim: You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Phil: Yeah I'll- I'll get it out. Thank you.
Jim: Yep. [Maguire keeps swinging]
 
Angela and Dwight: [silently working] [Pam walks back into office, gets paper out of the copier, shows it "voila" to camera, leaves]
 
Andy: [Jim's cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna! 
Jim: Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?
Pam: Just checking in, how's it going?
Jim: Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
Pam: I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
Jim: Oh, I like you.
Pam: Talk to you later?
Jim: Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
Phil: You can try. But I've looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesn't work. It's just- it's not in the stars, Jim. [Phil sinks putt] Six. 
Kevin: Yeah.
Andy: All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]
Kevin: Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
Andy: Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over] Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
 
Dwight: [hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him]
 
Michael: All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck. 
 
Michael: Hey! [walks up to Oscar and Darryl tossing basketballs, grabs Oscar's ball] Game over. [kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling]
 
Michael: [singsong] Just-in time.
Justin: Hi.
Michael: Just-in case. What's your last name?
Justin: Polznik.
Michael: This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
 
Michael: Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot! And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now.
 
Michael: I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
Oscar: Hey.
Justin: Hi.
Michael: This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will "do" you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
Pam: Excuse me.
Michael: Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
Oscar: Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
Michael: So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
Justin: You didn't want me before. That's what you said.
Michael: No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.
Justin: You were kind of a jerk to me.
Michael: I, uh, hmm.
Justin: And I'm, I'm gonna go now.
Michael: Why don't... hey.
 
Andy: [trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]
 
Dwight: [tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo!
Angela: Bless you.
Dwight: Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
 
Kevin: Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
Phil: Let's open a tab, because you and me are gonna be playing more often.
Andy: Count me in!
Phil: No.
Andy: All right!
Jim: Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Phil: I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let's talk then. Sound good?
Jim: Absolutely.
Maguire: Good playing with you guys.
Andy: Right on.
 
Jim: You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
 
Woman on mic: The job fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled.
Michael: Hold down the fort, I have to do something. [walks up to microphone] Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
 
Angela: [Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
Dwight: You're welcome.
 
Pam: [clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?
Jim: I closed it!
Pam: Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]
Jim: Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Pam: Well done.
Jim: Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch] 
Kevin: Oooh! [Kevin and Andy add suggestive "bow-chicka-wow-wow" vocals]
 
Michael: Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.
 
Michael: [standing way too close to Jim and Pam] Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. [Jim and Pam stop kissing]
 
Pam: Hi.
Graphics guy: Hello.
Pam: I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
Graphics guy: Are you interested in graphic design?
Pam: Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
Graphics guy: Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It's really basic. We're looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess.
Pam: I can do that.
Graphics guy: Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics.
Pam: I don't know any of those.
Graphics guy: [laughs] It's actually not super-complicated. I mean I'm sure there's some sort of like, adult education classes in the area. But if you're really serious about graphic design, one thing about New York or Philadelphia, they've got amazing programs out there for design.
Pam: New York or Philadelphia.
Graphics guy: Yeah.
Pam: All right. Cool, well... thanks.
Graphics guy: Sure. 
Pam: And uh, I'll look into those.
Graphics guy: You should.
Pam: New York or Philadelphia.
Graphics guy: Absolutely.
Pam: Okay. 
Graphics guy: It's where the action is.
Pam: Thanks.

Dwight: [cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?
Jim: [presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Dwight: Hello? Hello?
Jim: Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
Dwight: Jim, what are you doing?
Jim: And how many would you like?
Dwight: Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
Jim: Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
Dwight: [into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
 
Jim: Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
 
Dwight: [cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
Jim: [presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Pam: Hey, is this Dwight?
Jim: Yes it is.
Pam: Oh my goodness, you sound sexy.
Jim: Oh, thank you. I've been working out.
Dwight: Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
Pam: Have you?
Dwight: Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
Pam: Dwight?
Dwight: No! [waves arms] Pam, I'm over here!
Pam: I'm confused...
Dwight: Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
Jim: Can't do that. Unsanitary.
Dwight: Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
Jim: [office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
 
Jim: Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
 
Jim: Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
Dwight: [slams cell phone on desk] Argh! Ahh!!
 
Michael: Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
 
Toby: Morning.
Michael: Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps]
 
Toby: Good morning, Kelly.
Kelly: I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
Toby: Fine. Good.
Kelly: I feel weird.
 
Michael: First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.
Angela: We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
Michael: Okay.
Angela: But so far we only have two pictures of him.
Michael: Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...
Pam: Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?
Michael: If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
Angela: Michael...
Michael: Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
Angela: No. You know-no!
Michael: Toga!
Angela: You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
Michael: I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]
 
Michael: Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. "Michael, buy a motorcycle." So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.
 
Michael: I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
Pam: So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Angela: No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Michael: Phyllis, can you do this?
Phyllis: [whispers] Yes.
 
Pam: Hi, can I help you?
Holly: Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
 
Toby: As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
 
Toby: So this is H.R. This is your desk.
Holly: I love the view.
Toby: Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
 
Pam: Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek]
Jim: Hey... What?
Pam: Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
Jim: No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
Pam: Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!
Jim: Yes! So when do you start?
Pam: I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
Jim: Wow. Busy morning.
Pam: So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...
Jim: It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
Pam: Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.
Jim: See how easy that is?
Pam: Ohh... [they hug; she laughs]
 
Pam: I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here!
 
Toby: Hey, Stanley...
Stanley: Hmm?
Toby: I want to introduce you to...
Michael: [watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
Dwight: So what do we know about her?
Michael: Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
Dwight: I hate her too.
Michael: Why do you hate her?
Dwight: Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
Michael: You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
Dwight: Would that be such a bad thing?
Michael: Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
Dwight: What?
Michael: We need to sell her an elevator pass.
Dwight: But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]
Michael: Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
 
Phyllis: Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Woman over speakerphone: Antigravity machines?
Phyllis: That's right. Yeah.
Woman over speakerphone: What do they do exactly?
Phyllis: They make you feel lighter...
Woman over speakerphone: Antigravity... Um... Anti...depressants? I could put you through to someone on that.
Phyllis: Okay.
 
Michael: [knock on door] Yeah.
Toby: Hey Michael.
Michael: Oh, hey, do you still work here?
Toby: I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
Michael: Nah.
Toby: Come on.
Michael: No. I think I will pass.
Toby: Michael Scott, this is Holly.
Holly: Hi.
Michael: Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna win.
Holly: Man, someone doesn't like H.R.
Michael: Yeah.
Holly: [to Toby] What did you do to him?
Toby: Nothing.
Michael: T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
Holly: Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
Michael: Y-You can-Michael.
 
Michael: Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.
 
Creed: [shaking Holly's hand] The pleasure's all mine.
Holly: Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
Creed: Any time.
Holly: What do you do here?
Creed: ...Excuse me.
 
Creed: What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. "What do I do?"... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. "Qua" something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
 
Dwight: [whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?
Holly: No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
Dwight: He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
Holly: Oh. Good for you guys.
Dwight: Yeah.
 
Dwight: Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
 
Dwight: Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]
Holly: Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi.
Kevin: Hi.
Holly: What do you do?
Kevin: I do the numbers.
Holly: Oh, good for you.
Kevin: Do you want a M&M?
Holly: Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
Kevin: Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Holly: Well that is a very safe place for them.
Kevin: Yeah.
Michael: Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
Holly: Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
Michael: I bet.
Holly: That's good.
Michael: I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
Holly: No, no, I...
Michael: Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
Holly: Ooh, uh...
Michael: You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
Holly: Um... Y-yeah. Okay.
Michael: All right.
Holly: Thanks.
Michael: Yep.
Holly: Great.
 
Pam: Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
Toby: You're-you're not in it.
Pam: Well I was taking the picture.
Toby: I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
Pam: Sure, do you have a camera here?
Toby: No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh...
Pam: Okay...
Toby: I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
 
Jim: [on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
Ryan: Congratulations!
Jim: Thanks.
Ryan: Don't interrupt.
Jim: I just-
Ryan: Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
Jim: No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
Ryan: All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
Jim: All right, well it already went through, so...
Ryan: Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
Jim: Hello?
 
Michael: [listening to "Crash Into Me" on his computer] Hmm... Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P...
Jim: That's not it.
Michael: Music...
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: For a CD mix tape...
Jim: Close.
Michael: For Holly.
Jim: Mmhmm.
Michael: And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
Jim: What are the two levels?
Michael: The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"...
Jim: Mmhmm.
Michael: And "I... love you."
Jim: Okay. Let's start with the "I love you" level.
Michael: Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
Jim: Yes. You don't love Holly.
Michael: I think I do.
Jim: But you just met her.
Michael: Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
Jim: Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
Michael: Well, you're not a romantic.
Jim: Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
Michael: Oh really?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Like, with who?
Jim: We've been through this.
Michael: Pam?
Jim: Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
Michael: Yeah, you took it too slow.
Jim: Well, we're really happy.
Michael: This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
Jim: And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
Michael: I don't want her to get away.
Jim: I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
 
Jim: I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Phyllis: Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
Jim: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
Phyllis: Why would you do that?
Jim: Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
Phyllis: Really?
Jim: Well we all want a good party, right?
 
Jim: I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
 
Holly: Hey Kevin.
Kevin: Hi.
Holly: Do you need some help?
Kevin: I can't decide what to get.
Holly: Well, what do you like to eat?
Kevin: Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
Holly: Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
Kevin: Hmm...
 
Kevin: I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
 
Jim: [on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
 
Holly: [tool clicking] Damn it!
Michael: Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
Holly: Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
Michael: And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that.
Holly: Yoga.
Michael: [as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um...
Holly: [as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
Michael: So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.
Holly: Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
Michael: Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting!
Holly: [overdramatically] Acting!
Michael: [overdramatically] Acting!
Holly: [laughs] Lovitz.
Michael: Yeah.
 
Michael: I did it! [exhales]
Jim: What'd you do?
Michael: I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
Jim: Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
Michael: It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
Jim: Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
Michael: Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base...
Jim: There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
Michael: [giddy] Yeah...
 
Phyllis: Hello Angela.
Angela: Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
Phyllis: Can I get a list of your vendors?
Angela: I shredded it.
Phyllis: Why would you do that?
Angela: Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
Phyllis: [knocks files off desk] Sorry.
 
Toby: [Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?
Michael: Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?
Toby: Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
Michael: Yes we do.
 
Michael: I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.
 
Toby: [Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
Michael: Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
Holly: [enters conference room] Hello.
Michael: Hey! Hi, good to see you.
Holly: You too.
Michael: I'm just having a little exit interview.
Holly: Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.
Michael: Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
Holly: No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
Michael: Okay.
Pam: [enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?
Toby: Hi Pam. Stay.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?
Toby: I'm Toby.
Michael: Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
Holly: Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
Michael: Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
Holly: Here you go.
Michael: Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
Toby: This place, um...
Michael: Well, no no no no no...
Toby: I've got some ideas, I guess...
Michael: No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
Holly: Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.
Toby: Well let me see... I would, uh...
Michael: [hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll kill you.
Toby: I guess everything's okay.
 
Toby: I made it this far, right? What's the point?
 
Pam: Toby, why don't you open your present?
Michael: Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...
Toby: [unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] "Suck on this."
Michael: What the hell is that?
Pam: Michael...
Michael: That's... What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
Dwight: You did.
Michael: No!
Dwight: You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]
Michael: Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
Pam: So what is your gift?
Michael: My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
Pam: What is it?
Michael: I am going to give Toby...
Pam: Your watch?
Michael: ...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
Pam: I just knew.
Michael: How did you know?
Holly: Oh that is so sweet.
Michael: Well... That's my watch.
Toby: Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
Michael: Hey, that's good.
Creed: [from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]
Dwight: Oh my gosh.
Creed: It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]
Pam: Is that the police?
Dwight: Yes.
Creed: Mm-hmm.
 
Oscar: Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as "misleading the shareholders." Another good term is "fraud." The real crime, I think, was the beard.
 
Michael: [still watching video of Ryan] Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.
 
Kelly: I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, "Hi Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison."
 
Jim: Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
Pam: Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver]
Jim: [clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
 
Holly: What's protocol on this?
Toby: I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]
Holly: Michael, are you okay?
Michael: [voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend.
Holly: Oh, of course you are.
Michael: Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
Holly: No, hey.
Michael: I'm cool.
Holly: Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
 
Michael: Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.
 
Kevin: [everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
Phyllis: Kevin, take your shoes off first!
Michael: No antigravity machine, huh?
Phyllis: Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.
Michael: Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
 
Pam: Wow. Look at our parking lot.
Jim: Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
 
Pam: Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
 
Holly: Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
Michael: That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
Holly: I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
Michael: Thanks.
 
Dwight: You have it?
Meredith: Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car]
Dwight: Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]
Michael: I like, uh...
Holly: That-That's my car.
Michael: Hey. What are you doing?
Dwight: [Mose drops cage and runs] Mose!
Michael: What the hell is going on here?!
Dwight: N-nothing you need to know the details of.
Michael: There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
Dwight: N-no there's not.
Michael: Why did you do that?
Dwight: It was playful hazing.
Michael: No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right?
Dwight: It's not rabid.
Michael: Shh...
Meredith: Thanks for bringing that up.
Dwight: Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
 
Michael: I'm really sorry.
Holly: Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
Michael: Yeah...
Holly: I just... Um, excuse me.
 
Michael: Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! [giggles]
 
Vance Refrigeration guy: Hey Mrs. Vance, we're all out!
Phyllis: Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
 
Holly: Cool! You drive your own car?
Kevin: Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Holly: Yep. Just like you.
Kevin: Okay, bye.
Holly: Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.
 
Michael: [on microphone] Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
Pam: [everyone applauds] Yay, Phyllis!
Michael: Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
Pam: Song parody writer.
Michael: I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven."
Jim: Classic.
Michael: Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart."
Jim: Not my favorite, but...
Pam: I like that one.
Jim: It's not my favorite...
Pam: I like that one.
Michael: I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. [to band] Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp?
Darryl: Yeah. [music starts]
Michael: [sings] It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
 
Pam: I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
 
Michael: [singing] Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise...
 
Pam: Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
 
Michael: [singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
 
Holly: Not bad.
Michael: Oh, hey. Thanks.
Holly: Someday I would love to hear "Beers in Heaven."
Michael: Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
Kevin: Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
Michael: Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
Kevin: No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
Michael: What is it?
Kevin: Just hurry. [hangs up]
Holly: Is he okay?
Michael: Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
Holly: Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
Michael: Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.
 
Jan: Well it was good to see you.
Kevin: It was great to see you, Jan.
Jan: Yeah, so...
Michael: O-kay. Hello Jan.
Jan: Hello... Michael.
Michael: Wow, Kevin, really? We're- [to Jan] Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here?
Kevin: Yeah, Michael, I just uh...
Jan: I...
Kevin: I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Michael: Oh, okay.
Kevin: Yeah.
Michael: Thanks, Kevin. Um... [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan's pregnant belly]
 
Michael: Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous?
Jan: No.
Michael: Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
Jan: Uh, no.
Michael: Good. Good. Thank God.
Jan: I didn't...
Michael: Cause that's...
Jan: ... touch that.
Michael: Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
Jan: Why?
Michael: Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
Jan: Yeah, it did...
Michael: ... proud.
Jan: ... happen when...
Michael: Um...
Jan: ... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
Michael: You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
Jan: ...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you. I did not.
Michael: Well, okay... 
Jan: Yeah.
Michael: So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...
Jan: I went to a sperm bank.
Michael: You did?
Jan: Yuh-huh.
Michael: When we were going out?
Jan: Uh, yeah.
Michael: W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
Jan: I know.
Michael: You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
Jan: No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
Michael: IHop.
Jan: IHop.
 
Jan: If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
 
Jan: Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
Michael: I'm glad you told me.
Jan: Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
Michael: Um, I'll... I have to think about it.
Jan: Okay.
 
Michael: My whole life, I have known two things: I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.
 
Pam: Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]
 
Angela: [to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
 
Jim: [gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey...
Andy: [on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard]
Darryl: Unh! Damn it!
Andy: Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]
Angela: ...Okay.
Andy: Into the mic, sweetie.
Angela: I said, okay.
Andy: She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply]
 
Andy: I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.
 
Kelly: Can I be your bridesmaid?
Angela: No.
 
Dwight: Well... it's my own fault.
 
Andy: Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small explosion sound] I'm engaged!
Jim: I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.
Andy: Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
 
Toby: Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us.
Pam: Oh, yeah, um...
Toby: Yeah, could we...
Pam: Sure. Meredith, do you mind?
Toby: [hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.
Meredith: Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
Toby: It's digital, so just take as many as you want.
Meredith: One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
 
Pam: I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
 
Holly: Hey there.
Michael: Hey.
Holly: So you missed something really big.
Michael: Yeah?
Holly: Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
Michael: Oh, wow.
Holy: I'm not so specific as I can be on my first day, but...
Michael: Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh...
Holly: So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
Michael: Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.
Holly: Okay.
Kevin: I'll go to the diner with you.
Holly: Oh that would be great.
Kevin: Yeah, we can go eat pie.
Holly: I love pie.
Kevin: Me too.
Holly: Okay.
Michael: Have a good night.
Holly: Okay. Good night.
Michael: Bye.
 
Holly: Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
 
Michael: Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
Toby: Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?
Michael: Sorry. Corporate policy.
Toby: It's not.
Michael: You might take something.
Hank: I don't think he's gonna take anything.
Michael: Okay, security guard.
 
Toby: [watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.
Michael: Okay.
 
Michael: [on phone, leaving a message] Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning. [hangs up] I am going to be... kind of a daddy.
 
Phyllis: Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
Angela: [sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God!
Dwight: What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
