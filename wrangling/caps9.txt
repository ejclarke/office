ERIN: Andy s coming back today! Andy s coming back today! Ha! Andy s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time. 
DWIGHT: How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news. 
DOCTOR: Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father. 
ANGELA: I told you  
KEVIN: Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I m not that good at puzzles. 
OSCAR:  That piece doesn t go there.  
KEVIN: So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time. 
PAM: For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great. 
JIM: You are really good at modesty. She s a genius. She painted this incredible mural in the kids  room. There s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children  
PAM: Kay, well, you had that interesting thing. 
JIM: Oh, yeah 
PAM: Yes, Jim s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college. 
JIM: Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners. 
PAM: And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too. 
JIM: In Philly, so, that doesn t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea. 
PAM: He said if it takes off he s gonna buy us a new car. 
JIM: An Altima or better. 
TOBY: Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fianc  Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university. 
KELLY:  I don t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan. Toby:Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it 
KELLY: Enjoy the snow losers. 
ERIN: I m so happy for you Kelly. 
TOBY: Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons. 
RYAN: I ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It s a big university town. And, uh, that s not garbage, it s out clothes. 
PAM: And that was our summer. 
JIM: we good? 
OFF-CAMERA: Yeah 
PAM: Don t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company. 
OFF-CAMERA: Well we re more following you guys, to see how you turn out. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don t think anything s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time. 
ERIN: Andy s coming back today! 
CLARK: Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out? 
STANLEY: Oh, my god. It s called a garbage can. 
PHYLLIS: Helpless. 
TOBY: There s two new guys back there with me now. They re in their 20s. And we really get along. 
CLARK:  You re looking good. 
TOBY: Just three single guys. Getting into trouble. 
STANLEY: They re like the new Jim and Dwight. 
NELLIE: Oh, yes, yes I see that! Perfect. 
MEREDITH: Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face. 
PETE: No thank you. My name s Pete. 
JIM: No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith s face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim. 
ERIN: Andy s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy s here. Pam, he s here.  
ANDY: Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right! 
NELLIE: It sounds amazing, tell us all about it. 
ANDY: What re you still doing here? 
NELLIE: Wonderful, thanks. 
ANDY: You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died. 
NELLIE: Brilliant. 
ANDY: See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It s Clark and, um  
PETE: Pete! 
ANDY: In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop. 
PETE: What? Why? 
ANDY: Cause you re always taking dumps. 
PETE: No I m not. 
ANDY: Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time. 
CLARK: I love it. 
DARRYL: Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr. 
CLARK: No, I prefer Fart. 
ANDY: No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane. 
DWIGHT: I don t see it. 
CLARK: I don t either. 
ANDY: Whoa! Mind blown. It s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr? 
DWIGHT: Yes, yes I am.  
ANDY: Dwight, Jr!  
DWIGHT: In a way it s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I ll have a grandson. 
ANGELA: Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption. 
KEVIN: The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked? 
KEVIN: Angela s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can t eat cats. You can t eat cats, Kevin. 
ANGELA: No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look . He s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants 
KEVIN: I ll take him. 
ANGELA: Please, after the turtle? 
KEVIN: I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle! 
ANGELA: Oscar, Oscar, will you take him? 
OSCAR: No, I m a dog person. 
ANGELA: If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person. 
OSCAR: Those guys always change back, Angela. 
ANDY: David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm. 
DAVID: Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive. 
TOBY: Hey you wanted to see me? 
ANDY: Yeah, I gotta go David.  Why is Nellie still here? 
TOBY: You can only fire Nellie for cause. 
ANDY: Mm, then I will make up a cause. 
TOBY: Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you. 
ANDY: Then forget I just told you that. 
TOBY: Can t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean? 
ANDY: Now I know why Michael hated you so much. 
DWIGHT: Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods! 
CLARK: Yep, body by Cheez-it 
DWIGHT: Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested? 
CLARK: I think I m busy that night. Or I would. 
DWIGHT: Well, we re both just kinda learning as we go, aren t we? 
CLARK: Learning what? 
DWIGHT: Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head. 
CLARK: Kay. 
DWIGHT: So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man? 
CLARK: Is this is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that s totally fine. Like, I m fine with it. But you should know that I m into the ladies. 
DWIGHT: Spoken like a true root man. 
CLARK: You know, if you re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you. 
DWIGHT: My calls? 
CLARK: So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven t had time to pursue yet? 
DWIGHT: You want a list of my clients? You want my leads? 
CLARK: Yeah, I ll just give it a glance  
DWIGHT: Ok 
CLARK: I ll give it a read. 
DWIGHT: With my leads and stuff like that? 
CLARK: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Cause you re interested in going into sales? 
CLARK: I am. 
DWIGHT: Wow, that s great. That s great. Ok, good, let s talk about that, ok? 
CLARK: Ok. 
DWIGHT: You re not getting my clients! Nice try. 
DWIGHT: Paranoid? I m not familiar with the word. And I really don t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job. 
DWIGHT: Jim, get ready for the battle of your life. 
JIM: Done. Explain. 
DWIGHT: The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub. 
JIM: Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday. 
DWIGHT: Wait, sales what sales meeting? 
JIM: The new guys called one. 
DWIGHT: The new guys called a sales meeting? 
JIM: Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black? 
DWIGHT: There s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black? 
JIM: You should ask him. It s a color you would never expect.  Too easy. 
ANGELA: Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn t given me a definite yes or no. 
OSCAR: Definitely no. 
ANGELA: Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I m fine with either, but not both.  Listen, you re in this, but you need to wow me, ok? 
ANDY: I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It s going to be terrible. 
NELLIE: Not necessarily 
ANDY: No I m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn t, I m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don t like to throw around the b-word, but I m going to be a huge bitch to you. 
ANDY: Now this is called slack lining. 
ANDY: I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb. 
ANDY: If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather. 
RAFE: Iceman. 
ANDY: That s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack. 
JIM: You a sports fan? 
PETE: Sure, boxing, tennis. 
JIM: Oh. Any team sports? 
PETE: NASCAR. The Amazing Race. 
JIM: Phillies fan, though, right? 
PETE: You mean horses? 
JIM: No, like baseball. A baseball team. 
PETE: Ah, I like the Red Sox. I m from Vermont. 
JIM: Ok. Good talk. 
JIM: I have nothing in common with Plop. 
ANDY: All right, who s next? Nellie? 
NELLIE: Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends. 
ANDY: Nonsense. Get up here. 
KEVIN: Go ahead 
ANDY: Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels? 
NELLIE: I m very self-conscious about my feet. 
ANDY: Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa!  You suck. Alright, who s next? Darryl? 
DARRYL: This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do. 
ANDY: Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed. 
CLARK: Uh, I guess I could give it shot. 
ANDY: Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up. 
CLARK: Ok 
ANDY: Focus on the horizon.  Whoa! Look at this guy. 
CLARK: I ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears. 
DARRYL: Go, Dwight Jr! 
ANDY: Hey, yes. 
DWIGHT: Boo, unimpressed. It s a tightrope for babies. Boo! 
CLARK: Alright, let s see you do it. 
ANDY: Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord. 
ANDY: Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail? 
DWIGHT: Ok, I am just getting started, ok? 
CLARK: You got this, it s all you.  Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It s not a race, Dwight. 
ANDY: Well it s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool. 
DWIGHT:  That s not true. Just give me another chance. 
OSCAR: But your mouth is ble  
TOBY: This is a bloodbath. Alright, I m calling this. 
DWIGHT: What? 
TOBY: It is enough of this. Everyone, let s go back to work. 
DWIGHT: This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it.  Idiots. 
DWIGHT: Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn t seem so macho now, does it? It s a jump rope! 
PAM: Dwight! 
DWIGHT: Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on. 
PAM:  What are you doing? 
DWIGHT: Come here, I ll show you. 
ANGELA: Why do you want this cat? 
PETE: I don t want it, really. 
ANGELA: How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions? 
PETE: I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night. 
ANGELA: Have you taken any concrete steps? 
PETE: Well, I m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list. 
JIM: Oh, come on, Pete! God, that s just sad. If he doesn t watch himself, he s gonna be here for years, doing nothing.  Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim. 
DWIGHT: Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole. 
PAM: I will? 
DWIGHT: You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn t you say? 
PAM: Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds. 
DWIGHT: So you ll do it? 
PAM: No. 
DWIGHT: Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life. 
PAM: Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life. 
DWIGHT: Come on. 
PAM: Exactly the way it is. 
DWIGHT: No, Pam. 
PAM: Yes, and there s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it. 
DWIGHT: Please? Please, Pam? 
PAM: Find someone else, I don t know. Ask Phyllis. 
DWIGHT: I can t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I ll be launched into space. God, you re so insensitive. 
PETE: Why are you getting rid of it? 
ANGELA: Allergies. 
PETE: Your husband? 
ANGELA: No, the baby. Please, it s my husband s favorite cat. He s broken up about it. It s the only time I ve seen him cry other than our wedding night. 
OSCAR: You know what? I will take Comstock. 
ANGELA: Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you! 
OSCAR: I ll come by after work and pick him up. 
ANGELA: Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight 
OSCAR: C est la vie. 
ANGELA: Please don t teach the cat French. 
OSCAR:  Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock. 
PAM: You ready? 
JIM: Yeah. You know what? I ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call. 
PAM: Kay. 
DWIGHT: Ok. Oh, god.  
DWIGHT: Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute! 
JIM: Hey, man. It s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don t. I m in. Yeah, yep, I m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye.  Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Woo!  Ahh!! 
CREED: In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company. 
MEREDITH: Crap. Sorry, Nellie. 
NELLIE: Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would  
STANLEY: Mm, swish. 
NELLIE: Oh, it s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are. 
ANDY: There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge. 
NELLIE:  Fluke. 
PAM:  The building s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel. 
KEVIN:  Oh, yeah! Can I spin first? 
PAM: Well, it doesn t spin. We ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and  you see what chore you get that day. 
KEVIN: A wheel is supposed to spin. 
ERIN: Yeah, you know, like  guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh  guh. 
PAM: No, I m familiar with spinning. It s just that wouldn t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore- 
ANDY:  Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores. 
CREED: A wheel wants to spin, Pam. 
JIM:  Spinning would be more fun. 
PAM:   Kay. 
KEVIN:  Okay, that s what I m talking about! Big money, big money!  Mug duty? 
PAM: Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink. 
KEVIN: This sucks. 
ERIN: Yeah, seriously, it s like everything on there is work. 
PAM: I don t think you guys understand why we re doing this. It s- 
KEVIN: Yeah, I don t think that you understand wheels. 
PAM: I ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here s where we stand with the chore wheel.  We ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it s more fun this way. 
PAM:  The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It s so cute no one seems to mind. 
PAM:  Toilets!  
JIM:  Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma s got breakfast, OK?  We are going to Roy s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife s ex-fianc s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it s your wife s ex-fianc . 
PAM:  Thanks, mom! 
JIM:  A banana? 
PAM: Yeah. I m afraid he s only gonna have hot dogs. 
JIM: Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding. 
PAM: Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs. 
JIM:  Just  so weird. 
ERIN:  Oh, Pete, you ve got mail. 
PETE: Really? I got something? 
ERIN: Well, it s addressed to Customer Service so, it s your mail. 
CLARK: Well, you know, I m also Customer Service. 
ERIN: Yeah, I m alternating.  
PETE:  Yay, another person yelling at me. 
ERIN: Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time. 
PETE: That s really nice. 
CLARK:  Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election  thing is crazy, right? 
PETE:  It s open. 
ERIN: Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It s not a nice letter. 
PETE:  OK. 
NELLIE:  Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived. 
CREED: I know you don t really exist. 
NELLIE: Today, I launch my big charity initiative  Operation Give Back . Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I d like to see him piss on that one. 
ROY:  Darryl! Ha-ha! What s happening? 
DARRYL: Congratulations, baby! 
ROY: Ah, thank you! 
JIM:  Is this his house? 
PAM: Think so. 
SERVER:  Mimosa? 
PAM:  Thank you. 
SERVER: Would you like me to take your peel? 
PAM:  Yes, thank you.  
JIM: OK. 
PAM:  Who s that? 
JIM: Uh, my ex-fianc . 
PAM:  Ha-ha. 
JIM: I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn t know. Um  actually I did tell Pam and we decided  no . But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I m thinking there s another conversation coming. And, it s hard to know when that will be. 
NELLIE: With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports. 
KEVIN:  Oh boy! What's happening? 
NELLIE: There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley? 
STANLEY: American Diabetes Association. 
ANGELA: Um, you have diabetes, Stanley.  I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity? 
TOBY: I w-, uh, I would love to give uh- 
KEVIN:  Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank. 
CREED: I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes. 
NELLIE: Dwight, what about you? 
DWIGHT: I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works. 
ANDY: Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives. 
NELLIE: Thank you, Andy. 
ANDY: I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling. 
NELLIE: Dwight, you will be participating. 
DWIGHT: No thank you. 
NELLIE: Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like. 
DWIGHT: Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation. 
NELLIE: Great, thank you. 
DWIGHT: Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban. 
NELLIE:  Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan. 
CREED: The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though. 
NELLIE: Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back. 
DWIGHT: Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome.  
JIM:  There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what? 
ROY: Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice. 
JIM: Thanks for inviting us, by the way- 
ROY: Are you kidding? 
JIM: That was, that was a surprise. 
ROY: Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one.  Just kidding. 
JIM: You're welcome. 
ROY: Thanks...aw. 
JIM: By the way, man, this place is... beautiful. 
ROY: Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off? 
JIM: Gravel company? 
ROY: Yeah. What about you? What are you doing? 
JIM: Not gravel, obviously.  No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So- 
ROY: Oh, cool. 
JIM: Yeah, you never know. 
KENNY: Hey bro, stop wasting time with this haircut.  He's got a fifty-thousand dollar sports car. Cheers. 
JIM: OK, Kenny. 
CLARK:  Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on.  Erin, do you know anybody that might want...  Oh my gosh. You love the news, right? 
ERIN: Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad. 
CLARK: Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind. 
PETE: Uh, is it Duncan? 
CLARK: He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape. 
ERIN: You mean, put me on the news? 
CLARK: You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend.  What do you say? Huh? 
ERIN: Maybe, ok? Let me think about it. 
CLARK:  Ok. 
ERIN: Whoo! 
CLARK: Think it over.  
PETE: No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them. 
ERIN: I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon? 
ROY: So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you.  
JIM: He plays piano? 
PAM: No. Roy? No. 
ROY: You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it.  
DARRYL:  You got this, Roy.  
PAM:  We still surprise each other. 
JIM: Definitely. 
PAM: You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with- 
JIM: Courtside seats. Sixers. 
PAM: Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was- 
JIM: It was an away game. 
PAM: In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams.  Do we know everything about each other? 
JIM: No. 
PAM: Tell me one thing about you I don't know. 
JIM:  Um, ok.  
JIM:  Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I- 
PAM: And you thought you guys were millionaires. 
JIM: You heard that one. 
PAM: Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember. 
JIM: That I thought we were millionaires. 
PAM: Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one. 
JIM: That's all right. 
ANGELA: The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next.  
JIM: You all right?  
NELLIE: You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here. 
DWIGHT: Anything else would be inconsistent. 
NELLIE: Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office?  
DWIGHT:  Absolutely, I will. 
DWIGHT: I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh.  You don't have a plan. 
NELLIE: When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan. 
NELLIE:  Looking for this? 
DWIGHT: What the?  
NELLIE: Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it. 
DWIGHT:  Gimme that. 
NELLIE: Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off. 
DWIGHT: You're insane. 
NELLIE: I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity. 
DWIGHT: Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you. 
NELLIE: In that case, you...  will have to chop off my hand. 
DWIGHT:  This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most. 
NELLIE: I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands. 
DWIGHT: Sounds like a plan. 
ANDY:  Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment? 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ANDY:  Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition? 
CLARK: Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut. 
ANDY: Really? 
CLARK: Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back. 
PETE: Seems unnecessary for an audition. 
CLARK: And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so- 
ANDY: Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff. 
CLARK: I absolutely will do that. 
ANDY: Awesome.  Plop! 
CLARK: Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits. 
PETE: That Clark, huh? Errr  Ca! 
OSCAR:  Next question for our oldie-weds- 
KEVIN: What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie? 
ANGELA:  Language. 
PHYLLIS: Who was Pam's first celebrity crush? 
OSCAR: Pam's first celebrity crush. 
TOBY:  John Stamos. 
JIM: Ready? 
PAM: Uh-huh. 
JIM:  John Stamos. 
ANGELA: Oh! 
PAM: Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to- 
TOBY: Johnny Depp. 
PAM: Johnny Depp.  
TOBY:  Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp. 
KEVIN: Totally. George Clooney. 
TOBY: Uh-huh. 
ANGELA: OK, I have one. I have one.  
KEVIN:  What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie? 
ANGELA:  Kevin, stop it with that question. 
JIM:  Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow! 
JIM: It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real. 
PAM: I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim. 
DARRYL: Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence. 
ANDY: Her body. We're gonna talk about her body.  Good. Great job. 
DARRYL: Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black. 
ANDY:  Erin has an audition to be a newscaster.  
ANDY: Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl. 
DARRYL: OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color. 
ANDY: Yeah, right? 
JIM: I'm sorry. This is for a news audition? 
ANDY: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability? 
ANDY: News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy. 
OSCAR: I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite. 
MEREDITH: Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride. 
OSCAR: Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or... 
ANGELA: Has she done the pageant circuit? 
ERIN: No, I watch the news. 
ANDY: She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen. 
ERIN: This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job. 
CLARK:  Whatever it takes. 
PETE:  Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard. 
DWIGHT:  This is it. Any questions? 
NELLIE: Is it gonna be long? 
DWIGHT: No. It's gonna be over before you know it. 
ERIN:  Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented. 
DARRYL: Um, where did you get that story? 
ERIN: A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events. 
ANDY: I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name. 
ERIN: For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon. 
ANDY: Pause after 'news'. 
ERIN: For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon. 
ANDY: No, pause longer. 
DARRYL: That was a good one. 
ANDY: Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy. 
ERIN: Got it. For Channel 11 news...  
ANDY: Wha, it's- 
ERIN: I'm Erin Hannon. 
ANDY: OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there. 
JIM:  I can feel you looking at me. 
PAM: OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago- 
JIM: Uh-huh. 
PAM: I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know. 
JIM:  That didn't happen. You would've told me right away. 
PAM: Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me. 
JIM: Uh...  
PAM:  Just tell me. 
JIM: God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well. 
DWIGHT: Heh! Ha!   
PETE: Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team. 
ERIN: Oh. 
PETE: The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone. 
ERIN: Oh god. 
PETE: Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera. 
ERIN: Tuh. 
PETE: Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know.  
DWIGHT: Ha!  This is for real this time. 
DARRYL: It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little  inspiration. 
NELLIE:  Oh, a movie. What is this? 
DARRYL: 127 hours. It's about this guy who- 
DWIGHT: No, no. No spoilers. Please. 
DARRYL: My bad. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DARRYL: Goodnight. 
CLARK:  Hey! Everybody. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
CLARK: Come in. 
ANDY: All right! 
CLARK: Come on in. 
ANDY: Nice. 
CLARK:  What're you doing here? 
PETE: Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied. 
ERIN:  The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns. 
ANDY:  Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. 
ERIN: Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked. 
ANDY: He sure did. 
CLARK: All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody. 
ERIN: Aw! 
ANDY: Just, you sure Clark? 
CLARK: Yep, she's done. 
ANDY: No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that. 
CLARK: No, we got it. We got it. 
ERIN: Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving. 
ANDY: I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing. 
CLARK: OK, I don't. 
ANDY: All right. 
ERIN: I'm hungry. 
ANDY: Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something? 
PETE: Yeah, whatever you say, boss. 
ANDY: OK.  I'll call you later. 
ERIN: OK. 
ANDY:  So this is a single. 
ERIN: Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy. 
DWIGHT:  Oh god. 
NELLIE: That is absolutely revolting! 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
NELLIE: He is so good, though. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
NELLIE: The way he just cuts off his arm. 
DWIGHT: If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes. 
NELLIE: Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time. 
DWIGHT: Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius. 
NELLIE: Well, it doesn't make you stupid. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid. 
NELLIE: Stupid like you. 
DWIGHT: No, like you. 
NELLIE: Like you. 
DWIGHT: You're the stupid one. 
NELLIE: You're the stupid one. 
DWIGHT: You're the stupid one. 
NELLIE: You're the stupid one. 
DWIGHT: You, you, you, you... Fake 
JIM: Morning, Dwight 
DWIGHT: Who are you? Fake 
JIM: Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian Fake 
JIM: You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race. 
DWIGHT: Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday? Fake 
JIM: Uh, Wellington systems? Sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or, were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me. 
VOICEMAIL: Please enter your password. 
VOICEMAIL: You have one new message. 
DWIGHT: How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders! Fake 
JIM: Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work. 
DWIGHT: You don't work here! You're not Jim! 
PAM: Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico s at 7:30. Fake 
JIM: Oh great, can't wait.  
PAM: Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours. 
DWIGHT: I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!  
DWIGHT: Oh my ! Oh d ! Oh, how did ?  Huhhhhh! 
ERIN: Heyyy! Study buddies! 
DARRYL: Oh, ok. 
ERIN: Getting things done. Awesome! 
DARRYL: It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it! 
DARRYL: Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here.  Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament. 
ERIN:  S il vous plait dites-Moi Ugggghhh les Bleagh! 
DWIGHT: Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat. 
ERIN: I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there! 
DWIGHT: You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild. 
DWIGHT: Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads. 
DWIGHT: I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French. 
ERIN: Yeah! Let s do it! 
DWIGHT:  Atherozar! 
ERIN:  Oh! 
DWIGHT: It means  excellent . And we have begun. 
PAM: . Is everything okay? 
NELLIE: Hmm? Oh oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine. I'm mean, I d I just don't wanna burden you with my massive stress freak outs! 
PAM: Great. 
NELLIE: It s just that I am taking my driver s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to  Demandy .... I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But in who's car? 
ANDY:  Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here. 
NELLIE:  
PAM: Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime. 
NELLIE: Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  Nellie and 
PAM:  ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! 
PAM:  I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch. 
JIM: Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try. 
NELLIE: This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com 
ANDY: Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights. 
NELLIE: Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama! 
ANDY: As in... 
NELLIE: Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children. 
ANDY:  Wow! 
ANDY: This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us. 
ANDY: My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama. 
ERIN: I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like,  What's your stance on politics?  Or,  What is the best war to do?  And, I will just be like,  Duhhhh!  
ANDY: Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.  
PETE: Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm. 
CLARK: So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders. 
CLARK: Oooohhhhhhhh!    
CLARK: It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome. 
PETE: Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point. 
CLARK: Just clap through it, man. 
DARRYL: You log in sales at ten different times. If you log  em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching. 
JIM: That was really good, Darryl. 
DARRYL: Life hacking, man. 
ANDY: There he is! 
JIM: Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me . 
ANDY:  Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady? 
DARRYL: Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross. 
ANDY: It's me!  I am related to Michelle Obama. 
DARRYL: What?! Really? 
ANDY: I mean, it's distant, but... 
DARRYL:  Huh ha! That's cool, man. 
ANDY: Right? 
ANDY: Darryl said,  Cool, man.  He called me as cool man. 
PAM: You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat. 
NELLIE: Mmmm the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I m driving, so, I might as well get good at it. 
PAM: Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!! 
NELLIE: Whhooooo! 
OSCAR: I m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person? 
PHYLLIS: You think that Andy's family owned slaves? 
STANLEY: Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy. 
DWIGHT: I throat-rip. 
ERIN: Foth aggendak! 
DWIGHT: You throat-rip. 
ERIN: Foth aggendi! 
DWIGHT: He/she/it throat rips. 
ERIN: Foth aggenda! 
DWIGHT: More of a, barbaric growl. 
ERIN:  Forth aggenda! 
DWIGHT: Louder! You re shouting it from the back of a horse! 
ERIN: Wah!! Aggenda!! 
PAM: Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh? 
NELLIE:  Yeeeeahhhh! It's almost unbelievable! 
PAM: What? 
NELLIE: Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately. 
PAM: Sure. 
NELLIE: Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up! 
PAM: So he's not related to Michelle Obama? 
NELLIE: Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer. 
PAM:  
PAM: Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun. 
NELLIE:  Pam! . 
PAM:  
OSCAR: Well, if there s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I  
ANDY: What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it.  I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! . 
OSCAR: Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today. 
ANDY: Why? Is it employee s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays. 
OSCAR: Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were slave owners. 
ANDY: Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?  
DARRYL: Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament. 
ANDY: Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye.  Where were we? Uhhhh, yes. Okay. Your productivity thing. 
DARRYL: Yes, yes, yes. 
ANDY: Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum! 
DARRYL: I included some time saving ideas... 
ANDY: Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now. 
DARRYL: Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird. 
ANDY:  Right on, brotha. Wurddd. 
ERIN: Addor! 
DWIGHT: Daraas! 
ERIN: Qazer! 
DWIGHT: Daraas!  Does anyone here have fermented mare s milk? 
PETE: Hey Erin! 
ERIN: Azem choma! Chomakka-attun! 
PETE: Oh okay. Sorry. 
NELLIE: Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work. 
PAM: Yeah turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again those are the wipers. So the its just. There you go! Yeah.  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids red light that it's nice to have that creative outlet red light! Red light! Red! Red! 
NELLIE: That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work. 
PAM: Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby. 
NELLIE: That s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo! 
PAM: Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed. 
ANDY: . Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here? 
ERIN: Vos! 
ANDY: So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today. 
ERIN: Because of your slaves. 
ANDY: Not my slaves, my ancestors . Maybe. Probably not. 
ERIN: Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for  slave master ,  attafrauk! , is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed? 
ANDY: That you re learning a made-up language from HBO s Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out! 
ERIN: Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language. 
DWIGHT: People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it. 
ANDY: Hi guys. 
PHYLLIS: Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water? 
ANDY: Yeah. You don't have to ask me.  
ANDY: Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be . Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was  Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes  by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith African American Mambazo. 
PAM: Good. Very good. Oh no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy.  New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.  And then in parentheses, he wrote out  as soon as possible.  
NELLIE: Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back,  looking for dirt.  
PAM: Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding. 
NELLIE: Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding. 
PAM: Oh gee I m  
NELLIE: No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg!  I love it. 
PAM: Brilliant! 
NELLIE: What should we say about Jim? 
PAM: Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up. 
NELLIE: My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma.  I just made a joke there. 
PAM: I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there s something Jim isn't telling me. 
NELLIE: Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair! 
PAM: Jim? No. 
NELLIE: . How can you be sure? 
PAM: Because he just loves me too much. 
NELLIE: You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam? 
ANDY: I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol  family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States. 
ANGELA: Ew. 
ANDY: Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt. 
KEVIN: And John Wayne? 
ANDY: No. Not that I see here. 
KEVIN: Wayne Johnson? The Rock? 
ANDY: You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon! 
JIM: Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True  Oh no. 
ANDY: Dwight's grandfather was a . 
DWIGHT: Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So  
ANDY: I was gonna say he was a tax evader. 
DWIGHT: Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah! 
ANDY: And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden. 
MEREDITH: Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!  
ANGELA: Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me! 
PHYLLIS: Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families? 
KEVIN: Yeah, that you're being really mean, Andy. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, Andy. 
ANDY: No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it s not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it. 
OSCAR: The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did. 
ANDY: Might've done. And how  do you figure? 
OSCAR: Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves. 
ANDY: You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.  Okay, Kevin did that. I do not wish I was in Dixie.  Hey mom, how are ya? Did any Bernards ever own a plantation in the south?  She said no! Take that!  Follow up question. Did any Bernards, ever, make money, in an unsavory way?  I just asked you! Why didn't you just say that?  Oh, stop! Stop! Stop talking! Stop taking! That's no! I don't wanna know that. Ok. You're interrupting a meeting I have to go. Love you. Bye.  Well, turns out the Bernard's of yore did not own slaves. 
OSCAR: Really? 
ANDY: We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.  
ANDY: Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had. 
DARRYL: You re gonna po  mouth 
ANDY: Exactly. Help me po  mouth, Darryl. 
DARRYL: Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions  
ANDY: What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy? 
DARRYL: That could work. 
ANDY: You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here. 
DARRYL: I m going for a walk. 
ANDY:  Okay. 
PAM: Good. Good. And  
JIM: You doing alright, man? 
DARRYL: I'm done. I gotta get out of here. 
JIM: Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager. 
DARRYL: It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets. 
JIM: Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right? 
DARRYL: Hmm. Yeah right 
JIM: No, I'm serious. There's always something better. 
DARRYL: Like what? 
JIM: Like hypothetically  if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have. 
DARRYL: What kind of job? 
JIM: Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into? 
DARRYL: Hell yeah! 
JIM: Right? 
DARRYL: That sounds awesome! 
JIM: Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to... 
DARRYL: I love Philly! 
JIM: Right? 
DARRYL: It's not even a thought  
JIM: Not even a thought! It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright! 
DARRYL: What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening? 
JIM: Oh, it s happening! Let s just keep it between you and me for right now. 
DARRYL: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man! And Pam's into it? 
JIM: We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's I think she understands... what this is. 
DARRYL: Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real. 
JIM: What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real! 
DARRYL: It's not real... until your wife is on board. 
PAM: So what did you want to show me? 
NELLIE: That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it? 
PAM: Yeah. It's really ugly 
NELLIE: Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking a mural. 
PAM: You mean me? 
NELLIE: Yes! You! You are soo talented! It s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall. 
PAM: Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I Nellie, this is brilliant!  Hey! 
JIM: Hey! Can I talk you? For a second? 
NELLIE: Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you! 
PAM: What?! No! I-I got this.  Okay? 
NELLIE:  This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich. 
NELLIE: And Filipino. But we ll break that to her later. 
NELLIE:  You know what this is all about. 
DARRYL: Yeah. You too, huh? 
NELLIE: Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake! 
DARRYL: Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  Yeah. 
NELLIE: Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this. 
JIM: I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world. 
PAM: I still can't believe he didn't tell me. 
PAM: I was helping Nellie drive  
STANLEY: Do not care. 
PETE: Fonas chek! 
ERIN: Dothraas! chek!  
ANDY: I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith. 
ERIN:  Hmmm! 
ANDY: Alright everybody, great season of softball, I'm super proud of you guys and I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together.  
GROUP: Dunder Mifflin! 
ANDY: Andy Bernard 
PRESENTS: Summer Softball Epic Fails!  Fail.  Fail. 
KEVIN: That's me.  
ANDY: Fail. 
OSCAR: Is this like a blooper reel? 
ANDY: A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail!  Who's this guy? Look at him dance. Fail! 
DWIGHT: Fail! 
JIM: I deserved that. 
ANDY:  Do do do do do do do. 
DARRYL: That was a triple. 
ANDY: Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video! 
DARRYL: My pleasure.  Video 
ANDY: Hey, I'm Pete, puberty is such a drag, man. And I'm Clark! I like to eat toilet paper.  We fail!  
ANDY: I'd like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry in the warehouse who passed away this year.  Well, that's all folks.  Ski ya later everybody. Thanks for a great season.  
OSCAR: What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises. 
ANDY: Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK? 
JIM: Uh, what happened to that video I sent you? 
ANDY: Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right.. 
JIM: I think I got it right here.  
ANDY: That was not a fail. 
GROUP: Fail! Fail! Fail!... 
ANDY: That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm.  You're all failing right now.  Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail!  
DWIGHT:  Oh, god. 
PHYLLIS: What's going on? 
DWIGHT: Nothing! Nothing is going on. Keep moving please. 
STANLEY: What's he measuring? 
DWIGHT: OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please. 
TOBY: It's an EMF hotspot. 
PHYLLIS:  Oh my god! 
OSCAR: It stands for electromagnetic field. Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area  Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight. 
ANDY: Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall? 
TOBY: You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives? 
ANDY: I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour? 
STANLEY: Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven. 
DWIGHT: OK, listen. Everything here is up to code. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, the wires need insulation.  It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat. 
PAM:  Thank you. 
JIM: You got it. 
JIM: Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham!  Gotta go through me first. 
NELLIE: Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now. 
ANDY: Fine. I will give you one minute. 
NELLIE: Oh, please don't use the hourglass. 
ANDY: You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase. 
NELLIE: I'm trying to adopt a baby. 
ANDY: A baby what? A human?! 
NELLIE: And the...agency require a character reference from my employer. 
ANDY: Oh. 
NELLIE: You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So. 
ANDY: Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so. 
NELLIE: It's not..it's- 
ANDY: And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here. 
NELLIE: Well then if I could just convince... 
ANDY: And those sand grains are tumbling.. 
NELLIE: You. 
ANDY: With fury... 
NELLIE: It's not..it's not 
ANDY: Down the sides.. 
NELLIE: Entrapment if I'm.. 
ANDY: Of the hourglass.. 
NELLIE: ..writing.. 
ANDY: Time's up! 
NELLIE: Fine. 
ANDY: Sure. I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that. 
DWIGHT:   Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!  That means you can't make me do squat. 
MEREDITH: You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts. 
DWIGHT: You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls. We'd have to shut this place down for a week. 
PAM: Week off. That'd be great. 
DARRYL:  Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so. 
CLARK: I don't want to teach you Power Point. 
DARRYL: Come on! Just show me the Power Point. 
CLARK: Just do the tutorial. 
DARRYL: You're the tutorial. 
CLARK: No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial. 
DARRYL: You could be. 
CLARK: Mm-mm. 
DARRYL:  What are you doing? 
JIM: Getting my wife a week off from work. 
DARRYL: You popped one kernel. 
JIM: Awesome, right?  
CLARK: So Creed is that dude's step dad? 
DARRYL: Correct. 
JIM: Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause.  
DWIGHT: What? Come on. 
CREED: I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair... 
MEREDITH: I'm not gonna grow a third arm! 
DWIGHT: I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way. 
JIM:   Side effects of EMF 
INCLUDE: headaches...  
DWIGHT: Had 'em all my life. Jim: ..breast pain...  
DWIGHT: No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim. 
JIM: Oof.  Infertility.  
DWIGHT:  Yeah right.  
JIM: Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me? 
DWIGHT: Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot.  What the? 
JIM: What? 
DWIGHT: Some of these kernels have crowned. 
JIM: That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag... Oh my god. 
DWIGHT: Andy!  
JIM: I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids. 
PAM: Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way? 
JIM: You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also?  Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen. 
PAM: A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb. 
JIM: Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied. 
PAM: Yeah, OK then. 
ANDY: Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement. 
DWIGHT: So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week. 
MEREDITH: Nice job. 
DWIGHT: In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour. 
JIM: What? 
PAM: What's this? 
ANDY: Whoa! 
JIM: What? 
DWIGHT:  Bring it in! 
DWIGHT: Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus.  If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away.  In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done. 
STANLEY:  There are a hundred packs.. 
OSCAR:  No six after the eight, no.... 
STANLEY: Shh! 
OSCAR: Shh! 
STANLEY: Ninety nine cases..yeah. 
OSCAR: Six.  
ANGELA: Ooh! 
PETE: Oh sorry! Sorry. 
ANGELA: Oh my god! 
ERIN:  Sorry. 
MEREDITH: Lose weight. 
ERIN: I'm trying. Sorry. 
ERIN:  Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard. 
NELLIE: Oh of course, you were adopted. 
ERIN:  I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe?  Oh well. 
NELLIE: Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..? 
ERIN: Absolutely. I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help. 
NELLIE: Oh thank you so much! 
ERIN:  Just don't tell Andy, because.. 
NELLIE: He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness.  
CLARK: Stretch. Alright. 
STANLEY: How many times do you need to take a stroll? 
CLARK: I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue. 
STANLEY: Boy, I will hammer spank your rear. 
JIM: Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face. 
CLARK: It's a medical thing. 
JIM: Just...you good? 
CLARK: I'm good. I.. 
JIM:  I'm so sorry for all of this. 
PAM: It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest. 
ANGELA: I, I need to get to the paper please.  
PAM: Oh my god! Ah! 
JIM: I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please! 
PAM: You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine.  
JIM: Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that.  Really? Smirking? 
DWIGHT: What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage. 
JIM: Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever? 
DWIGHT: It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas. 
JIM: Andy! 
ANDY: Yo. Dudeces. 
JIM: You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania? 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I know I'd be more productive. 
KEVIN: As would I. 
STANLEY: No question. 
DWIGHT: No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site. 
JIM: What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy? Phyllis, Kevin & 
STANLEY: Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! 
ANDY: Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving. 
ERIN: Yes!  
JIM: Next 
STOP: Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also. 
PAM: Oh! Yes!  
JIM:  So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh? 
DWIGHT: Get your foot behind the yellow line. 
JIM: You got it. 
ERIN: Yeah Jim!  
DARRYL:  Stop. 
CLARK: Come back. 
DARRYL: Too late. 
CLARK: Mmm. 
GROUP: Shabooyah, role call. Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call. 
PAM: My name is Pam. 
GROUP: Yeah! 
PAM: I like to paint. 
GROUP: Yeah! 
PAM: You think you're better? 
GROUP: Yeah! 
PAM: Oh no you ain't! 
GROUP: Role Call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call! 
KEVIN: My name is Kevin. 
GROUP: Yeah! 
KEVIN: That is my name. 
GROUP: Yeah! 
KEVIN: They call me Kevin. 
GROUP: Yeah! 
KEVIN: Cause that's my name. 
GROUP: Role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! 
CREED:  Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god. 
ANDY: Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve!  Ah OK, now a serious one. 
PAM: Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately? 
JIM: If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah. 
PAM: No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him. 
JIM: He's just mad that we're all having fun. 
PAM: Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge? 
JIM: He's fine. He's indestructible. 
ERIN: Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages. 
NELLIE:  Well, I have considered kidnapping one. 
ERIN: Never say that. 
ERIN: I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt. 
NELLIE: I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up. 
STANLEY: Next stop pies!  
GROUP: Next stop pies! 
KEVIN: Next stop pies! 
JIM: Let's go driver!  Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so... 
KEVIN: At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare. 
ANGELA: So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head? 
KEVIN: Wh... 
OSCAR: Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies? 
KEVIN: 314 pies. 
OSCAR: What if it were salads? 
KEVIN: Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas. 
JIM: OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop. 
DWIGHT: That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up. 
JIM: Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on! 
PAM: Hey honey, I don't think we should push him. 
JIM: Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?! 
GROUP: No! 
DWIGHT: Stop ordering me around, Jim! 
JIM: What do we want?! 
GROUP: Pies! 
JIM: When do we want it?! 
GROUP: Pies! 
DWIGHT: OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go.  Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie. 
JIM: That's impossible.  Dwight! 
MEREDITH: Oh my! 
JIM: What are you doing? 
MEREDITH: Dwight, what the hell? 
OSCAR: Dwight! 
CLARK: What? 
KEVIN: Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back. 
PHYLLIS:  Just drive away. Just.. 
PAM: Phyllis! That's not safe. 
KEVIN: Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left. At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it. 
PAM:  Go up and check on him. He's upset. 
JIM: You know he's doing all this on purpose. 
PAM: Please? Just make sure he's OK?  
STANLEY: Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream! 
ANDY: Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point!  
MEREDITH: What? 
JIM: Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing- 
DWIGHT: I'm barren, Jim. 
JIM: What? 
DWIGHT: My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building. 
JIM: Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank. 
DWIGHT: You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank? 
JIM: No. 
DWIGHT: That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done.  
JIM: I'll take it. 
NELLIE: Andy? 
ANDY: Who is it? 
NELLIE: Um, is this a good time? 
ANDY: Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis.  Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok,  blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable. 
NELLIE: Oh, why, is there something? 
ANDY: It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater. 
NELLIE: Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the- 
ANDY: Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time. Good luck with your impossible dream. 
NELLIE: Alright then. 
JIM: Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant. 
DWIGHT: Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive? 
JIM: That doesn't matter. 
DWIGHT: What position did you use to conceive? 
JIM: Ok...that's not... 
DWIGHT: Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim. 
ANDY:  British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right? 
PETE: I don't think that's Nelly. 
ANDY: What? 
NELLIE: Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright.  It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you. 
JIM: Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children? 
DWIGHT: You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it. 
JIM: Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin.. 
DWIGHT: Bildenkinder. 
JIM: OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me. 
PAM: Oh!  Hey! How'd it go? 
JIM: It's pretty good actually. 
PAM: Yeah? 
JIM: We bonded. We got to-  
OSCAR: Whoa! Whoa! Dwight!  
DWIGHT: When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way! 
PAM: You feel OK now? 
DWIGHT: Oh, better than OK.  You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie. 
PAM: Well, actually, rhubarb is- 
JIM: Don't.. 
PAM: the one pie that I don't. 
JIM: Don't.. 
DWIGHT: Everybody! Hang on!  
ANGELA: Oh!  
JIM:  Pie! Pie! Pie! 
GROUP: Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie!  
NELLIE: Oh. 
ANDY: I changed my mind.  
NELLIE: Oh, you signed it? 
ANDY: Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it.  Well, yeah, whatever. So.  
NELLIE:   She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.  
KEVIN: I insult you, Oscar. 
OSCAR: What? 
KEVIN: I insult you! To your face! 
OSCAR: I don't know what you're talking about. 
KEVIN: Then why don't you do something about it? 
OSCAR:  Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie? 
KEVIN: You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face!  Yes! 
PAM: Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed. 
JIM: We did it. 
PAM: You did it. 
ANDY: My name is Andy! 
GROUP:  Yeah. 
ANDY: I don't do drugs! 
GROUP: Yeah. 
ANDY: Now check the style! 
GROUP: Yeah. 
ANDY: Of Flatt & Scruggs! 
GROUP: Yeah.  
PAM: Role call. 
PHYLLIS: Role call. 
OSCAR: Role call. 
CREED: What? 
DWIGHT: This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween. 
ERIN:  
DWIGHT:  It may have been the costliest decision I ve ever made. 
DWIGHT: My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ... 
JIM: It won t budge. 
DWIGHT: I can t get it out. Try again! 
DWIGHT: I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin... 
DWIGHT:  Jim, no. No. No! No! 
DWIGHT: But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me. 
DWIGHT: At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right? 
ERIN: Hey guys. 
PAM: Hey. 
ERIN: Pam, what are you? 
PAM: I am Dr. Cinderella. 
JIM: Cece s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models. 
PAM: I m an oncologist and you are a dog. 
ERIN: No, I m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen. 
JIM: It s Okay. 
ERIN: Uh, Jim, you re not dressed up at all. 
JIM: Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys.  Can I have your sunglasses? 
ERIN: Jim, come on. I thought we were past this. 
PAM: So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me? 
JIM: There s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume. 
PAM: Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me. 
JIM: Gettin  a lot of mileage out of this, aren t ya? 
PAM: Yeah, well, get used to it, bud. 
ANDY: A jitterbug.  You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions? 
ANGELA: The senator will be joining us later. 
ANDY: Not a question. 
ANGELA: No, it wasn t. 
ANDY: Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere. 
HCT:  
ANDY: Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble! 
HCT:  
ANDY: Aaah!  So good! 
DWIGHT: What lab did these little clones escape from? 
ANDY: My Cornell a capella group. 
PAM: You were in an a capella group? 
DARRYL: You went to Cornell? 
ANDY: Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party. 
STANLEY: Ugh. I don t want to sit through a whole concert of that. 
CLARK: I do. I love the boss s interests. 
ANDY: Atta boy Clark! 
MEREDITH: Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition? 
ANDY: No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away. 
ANDY: You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I m so not prepared. 
JIM: Are you sure you re okay with me putting in this much money. 
PAM: Yeah. I mean, listen if we re gonna do this thing, we should do it right. 
JIM: You re the best. 
PAM: I kind of am. It s crazy. 
JIM: Okay. I ll see you in a little bit. 
PAM: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Jim. Look I m eating you. 
JIM: Shut up. 
DWIGHT: Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I m eating Jims. 
ERIN:  
DWIGHT:  Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink. 
ERIN:  Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 
DWIGHT: Oh no, I m spilling Jim all over the carpet.  
ERIN: Stop it stop it stop it stop it! 
DWIGHT:  Hello little pill. What do you do? 
DWIGHT: Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. 
TRANSLATION: There s a madman in our midst. 
PAM: Okay I give up. What are you? 
NELLIE: I m sexy Toby. 
PAM:  Gross. I love it. 
DWIGHT: Dumatril! 
NELLIE: Something wrong Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Dumatril. 
NELLIE: Yes? 
DWIGHT: This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It s not for any disorder of the body.  It s for a disorder of the mind. 
NELLIE: The mind is part of the body. 
DWIGHT: Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane...  They are now off their meds. 
NELLIE: Dwight, our co-workers  health issues are really none of our business so- 
DWIGHT: Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What s going on Nellie? Talk to me. 
NELLIE: Hm? 
NELLIE: It s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I m not ashamed of that, But I m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong. 
NELLIE: Yeah, you re right. This man needs to be apprehended. 
DWIGHT: I ll get my apprehension kit. 
ANDY: Ruh duh duh da dudes! What s up? 
HCT:  
ANDY: I know that it s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname "Boner Champ," that is when I became me. 
ANDY: You didn t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now s your chance! I m here. You got Qs; I got As. HCT Member 
#1: Did you say you ve got AIDS? 
ANDY: No, I don t have AIDS. That s not what I said. Next question.  
ANDY: You don t have any-- Any questions about the old days?  You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ? HCT Member 
#2: I thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ. 
ANDY: I m sorry, what? HCT Member 
#2: I just thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ. 
ANDY: Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ. 
PETE: I didn t realize that everybody here dresses up every year. 
CREED: Me neither. 
CREED: It s Halloween. That is really, really good timing. 
ANDY: I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you re Boner Champ. Broccoli 
ROB:  I m so sorry! I don t know how that could have happened. 
ANDY: Did you maybe tell them that or...? Broccoli 
ROB: I just-- I just started yappin  about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky. 
ANDY: Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it s really stupid, but it s also really, really, really important. Broccoli 
ROB: Will do. I love you, Andy. 
ANDY: Love you too. Businessman 
#1: So the workspace looks awesome. 
JIM: Wow. Businessman 
#2: And the graphic designer is going to be sending in some of the logo treatments. I can t wait to see them. Businessman

JIM: Oh, uh, is it too late to get in? Businessman 
#3: Oh Jim, I explained everything. So you re all set. 
JIM: Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor. Businessman 
#2: Wow, well what level of investment were you thinking about? 
JIM: We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just -  - all in. Businessman 
#3: Welcome aboard! 
JIM: All right.  Awesome. Cool. 
DWIGHT: Hi Daryl. I m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead. 
NELLIE: You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning. 
DWIGHT: That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy? 
DARRYL: I can t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks. 
DWIGHT: So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy? 
DARRYL: Get under your chin first. Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Is that where the nanobots like to come in? 
DARRYL: Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah. 
DWIGHT: Is that how they like to get in? 
DARRYL: Yeah, that s crazy. 
DWIGHT:  I don t know. I just don t know. 
ANDY: Yo! Bad boys of a capella. 
HCT:  Hey. 
ANDY: Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories? HCT Member 
#3: Yeah, I got a call from Broccoli Rob. I guess you really are the Boner Champ. 
ANDY: Did he tell you how I got the name? HCT Member 
#3: No. 
ANDY: Spring sing  95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way. 
ANGELA: And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator? 
OSCAR: Senator Lipton, nice to see you. Senator 
LIPTON: Nice to see you Oscar. 
ANGELA: Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem! Senator 
LIPTON: So Oscar, you re a dinosaur. 
OSCAR: Actually I m the electoral college. Senator 
LIPTON: Ouch! Right on target. 
ANGELA: You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis! Senator 
LIPTON: God, it s just so good to see you. 
OSCAR: I, uh, huh, just  Senator 
LIPTON: All having this wonderful Halloween gathering. Excuse me, is that punch? 
ANDY: They didn t know about the snowman story, and when I told  em, they were not impressed. 
ERIN: What is with these turkeys? 
ANDY: Right? 
ERIN: Hey! You better do  Faith.  You get me? HCT Member 
#3: We don t know it. 
ERIN: So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin  song. HCT Member 
#3: Look, I know it was big with the old guys, but-- 
ERIN: Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please.  This isn t stupid. 
PETE: What? 
TOBY: Hey. 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
NELLIE: Hey Toby. 
TOBY: Are... are you me? 
NELLIE: Yes. 
TOBY: Oh my goodness, look. Look at this. 
NELLIE: Yeah. I... 
TOBY:  
NELLIE: Yes. I thought I d you know, be you. 
TOBY: Look at.. Look at me.  
NELLIE:  It s funny right?  
DWIGHT: All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill. 
NELLIE: Okay, look Dwight, let s just call this thing off. I mean, it s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety. 
DWIGHT: You think I don t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don t need some stupid pill to get me through all this. 
MEREDITH: Cool. Free upper. 
DWIGHT: Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha! 
MEREDITH: Don t dog catch me! 
DWIGHT: Gotcha! Yeah! Let s see ya get out of this web, huh? 
MEREDITH: Let me out! 
NELLIE: The pill is mine. 
DWIGHT: What? 
NELLIE: Get her out. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
MEREDITH: Stop baggin  my head! 
NELLIE: Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too. 
PAM: Hey, how d it go? 
JIM: Oh man, it was great. They were great. 
PAM: Did you end up investing? 
JIM: I did, yeah. 
PAM: How much? 
JIM: Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten... 
PAM: About ten? 
JIM: Ten. It was the full ten. 
PAM: Wow. 
JIM: Yeah. 
PAM: Wow. 
JIM: Yeah. Yeah. It s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to... 
PAM: No yeah. Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. 
PAM: So did everybody ... 
JIM: What is it? 
PAM: Did everybody end up investing ten thousand? 
JIM: Um, oh man, I don t actually know. 
PAM: What? 
JIM: They weren t really talking that much about money. They just said, We re good with investing and then I...and I... 
ANDY: Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble! 
HCT:  
PAM: They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars? 
JIM: No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam. 
PAM: So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player? 
JIM: You weren t there. 
HCT:  
JIM: It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later. 
HCT:  
PAM: Talk about it now. 
JIM: Pam. 
PAM: Jim, that was most of our savings. 
HCT:  
CLARK: Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where s the band?  Cause there s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths. 
CREED: Yeah. That's what she said. 
CLARK: What, am I overdoing it? No. No. 
HCT:  
PAM: We said some. We said  some.  
JIM: We ll talk about it later. 
HCT:  
PAM: We said part not all. 
HCT:  
CLARK: Yes! All right! 
ANDY: Oh Man!  
CLARK: That s how you do that! Whoo! 
HCT: Thank you. 
STANLEY: Show some pride. This is crap. 
DWIGHT: I agree. Yes, crap. Continue. HCT Member 
#3: Now folks, by special request, we re going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room. 
DARRYL: Who? HCT Member 
#3: It s Mr. Andy Bernard! 
ALL:  
HCT:  
ANDY: No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man... HCT Member 
#3: He reminded us today of how much he means to us. And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, here s an old Treble classic. 
HCT:  Broccoli 
ROB:   
ANDY: Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here? HCT Member 
#3: She said you wanted to hear  Faith . That s Broccoli Rob s signature song. 
ANDY: That s my signature song. HCT Member 
#3: I really didn t know that man. I just thought you wanted to hear it. 
ANDY: Russell, I m dressed like George Michael. HCT Member 
#3: I thought you were Adam Lambert. 
ANDY: Wha...? 
ERIN: The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it s kind of pathetic. But when you re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love. 
ERIN: Are you okay? Broccoli 
ROB:  He s still mad. 
ANDY: Shut up, Broccoli. Broccoli 
ROB: Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 cc s of George Michael stat. So just... Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number. 
ANDY: You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man s signature solo is his for life, okay? That s group policy and you know it. Broccoli 
ROB: Look, it s not my fault that I still live near campus, and it s my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week. 
ANDY: Just don t do the song anymore. Broccoli 
ROB: I tell you what, we ll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and I ll do the same, and I m so confident that I ll win, I won t even warm up. 
ANDY: Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes. Broccoli 
ROB: My pipes are primo, Champ. Why don t you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes? 
ANDY: I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch! Broccoli 
ROB: He said, and I quote,  Hey Rob, nice pipes . That happened! 
ANDY: OK, fine, yeah. that s one guy s opinion! Broccoli 
ROB: That's real. 'That ll never change! 
ERIN: Okay! 
ANDY: Doesn t mean you re the best singer ever. Dick. 
JIM: I thought that concert was pretty great. 
KEVIN: Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome. 
ANGELA: They lost me when they sang  Monster Mash . That song obviously glorifies the occult. 
JIM: Angela, it s Halloween. You have to sing  Monster Mash . 
PAM: Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to? 
JIM: Uh... 
PAM: No I m just, I m saying, what would happen if they didn t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot? 
JIM: Okay. We ll, just forget it. 
PAM: No! No, I m interested. I mean I think everybody s interested in why they have to sing it. 
JIM: Because it is Halloween. So if you re going to sing a concert, it s a good idea to throw that one in. 
PAM: Yeah, yeah, no, no. It s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can t do if you just keep singing  Monster Mash.  
KEVIN: It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates  Monster Mash.  I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid! 
ANDY: This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell? 
ERIN:  Yeah. 
ANDY: I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time? 
ERIN: Oh well, Andy, we re not moving to Cornell. 
ANDY: Duh. I know. That would be insane. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ANDY: It could totally work though. I don t know why we wouldn t. Oh my god are we doing this? 
ERIN: Oy. Andy, what s going on? 
ANDY: If I am not Boner Champ, I don t know who I am. 
ERIN: Well, um, you know maybe you re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just-- 
ANDY: Make a donation. 
ERIN: Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor. 
ANDY: Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom. 
ERIN: Oh. Dwight: I want some of those pills. 
NELLIE: Oh, well good for you. I mean, you ll need a prescription. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They re not for me. They re for my cousin Mose. He s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose. 
NELLIE: Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he s a good man and that I hope he feels better. 
DWIGHT: Which one? Mose or the real Mose? 
NELLIE: The real Mose. 
DWIGHT: He says Thank you. 
ANDY:  Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there.  What?  
ERIN: What s wrong? 
ANDY: My parents are broke. 
OSCAR:  Can you guys come with me for a minute? 
OSCAR: I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair. I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. ...Why? 
ANDY: Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay? 
WHITE: Or we can hope for a holiday rally? 
ANDY: White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster. 
PAM: Andy's family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman. 
JIM: And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar. 
PAM: The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so.. 
JIM: Competent. 
PAM: Right? 
ANDY: Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so,  him. 
OSCAR: Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok? 
KEVIN: That's beautiful. No, I totally get that. 
OSCAR: Can you do this, Kevin? 
KEVIN: I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that. 
OSCAR: I don't know what that means. Hey, hey- 
PAM:  Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you.  Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio? 
CREED: Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura Show. 
PAM: Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues?  
DWIGHT: I do! I do. I do. I do. I do. 
DWIGHT: The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous?   Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.  It's that easy. 
MEREDITH: Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze. 
ANDY: Yeah. He's in rehab actually. 
MEREDITH: Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour. 
ANDY: No, it's in New Mexico. 
MEREDITH: Oh...So..- how are you holding up? 
ANDY: We're done Meredith. 
DWIGHT:  blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle... 
JIM: Dwight! 
DWIGHT: ...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason. 
JIM: No, you chose yourself. 
DWIGHT:  Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit.... 
ANDY: Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal. Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom. 
DARRYL: Sounds great. 
OSCAR: Perfect. 
ANDY: Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas.  
KEVIN: What happened? 
ANGELA: Jammed. This day couldn't get worse.  
KEVIN: Yeah, I think this day could get worse. 
ANGELA: What does that mean? 
OSCAR: Kevin! 
KEVIN:  I don't know what you're talking about.  
ERIN: She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month. 
ANDY: Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut? 
DARRYL: If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months. 
ANDY: Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born. 
ERIN: Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories? 
DARRYL: I worked at a Jiffy Lube. 
ERIN: See? I bet you wouldn t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl? 
DARRYL: I would if I owned it and I went broke. 
ANDY: Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat. 
ANDY: Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it. What are you gonna do? Cry about it?  Excuse me. 
PAM:  Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called. The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so... 
NELLIE: Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple. 
PAM: He's gonna be disappointed. 
JIM: Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen. 
PETE: Fax? 
ERIN: Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy.  He's seriously juvenile. 
PETE: Cool. He's like 40 though, right? 
ERIN: Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops. 
PETE: Awesome. Have fun. 
DWIGHT: Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds-  This is Dwight Shrute. 
PAM:  Please hold for Ms. Black. 
NELLIE:  And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute. 
DWIGHT: Iris, thank you so much for having me. 
ERIN:  Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth.  
ANDY: Uh, did you need something? 
ERIN: Oh, I just need your signature on this. 
ANDY: Ok.  thanks. 
ANGELA: Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more? 
KEVIN: I... did not. 
ANGELA: I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore. 
KEVIN:  Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh!  I have to go to the bathroom! 
ANGELA: That doesn't surprise me. 
OSCAR: That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom. 
JIM:  See these forms... 
KEVIN: I have to go to the bathroom!  
KEVIN:  I have to go to the bathroom! 
KEVIN:  
ERIN: Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend? 
ANDY: Look, it's not that I don't want- 
ERIN: Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect. 
ANDY: All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said  You can't be a skipper until you're a man.  You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance. 
ERIN: Well, when does the boat leave, exactly? 
ANDY: Tonight. 
ERIN: Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail. 
ANDY: Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now. 
ERIN: Ok, well then let's leave like right now. 
ANDY: Yeah, ok. 
ERIN: Yeah! OK! Let's go. 
ANDY: Seriously? 
ERIN: Of course, seriously. Get your coat on. 
ANDY: Alright. 
ERIN: Alright. 
ANDY: Let's do it. 
ERIN: Let's do it! 
DWIGHT:  Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on. 
NELLIE:  So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command? 
DWIGHT: Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris. 
NELLIE: Uh, excuse me.  I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons? 
DWIGHT: Yes..? 
NELLIE:  I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together. 
DWIGHT:  Now then, we were saying. When my workers-gather- 
NELLIE: Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute.  Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine. 
DWIGHT: That's impossible. 
NELLIE: Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper? 
ANGELA: The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out. 
OSCAR: That's a tough one. 
ANGELA: That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can. 
KEVIN: Please, stop. 
ANGELA: What? 
KEVIN: Please, stop. 
ANGELA: Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in.  
KEVIN:  I can't, it's too much!  
OSCAR: I'm in big trouble. 
KEVIN: Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble. 
DWIGHT:  OK, how is my voice now? 
NELLIE: I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic? 
DWIGHT:  This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me. 
OSCAR: It's clearly not an accounting mistake. 
TOBY: Yeah. 
OSCAR: So... 
TOBY: Kevin. His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation. 
OSCAR: Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do. 
DWIGHT: This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say!  I dare you to produce one credible source about this. 
NELLIE: Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick  
PAM:  Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure. 
NELLIE: Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic? 
PAM: No the paper's not toxic. 
DWIGHT: Thank you Sandra! 
PAM: Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic! 
DWIGHT: Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled!  
JIM: What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?! 
DWIGHT: Get out of here moron!  
NELLIE: Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to? 
DWIGHT: uhhhh....no one. 
NELLIE: Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron? 
DWIGHT: No, everything's fine. 
NELLIE: Are you insulting my guests? 
DWIGHT:  
KEVIN:  Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion? 
OSCAR: I hope that's it, Kevin. 
KEVIN: Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that. 
TOBY: Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about- 
KEVIN: Hi. 
OSCAR: Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just.. 
KEVIN: Oscar, we're in the middle of talking. 
OSCAR: Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me.  
KEVIN: Oh that is nice. Classy move.  
DWIGHT:  That's what I'm saying! No of course not! 
KEVIN: What are you doing? 
OSCAR: Those figures I gave you? They're false. 
TOBY: How? 
OSCAR: I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively. 
TOBY: So you set him up. 
OSCAR: Yes, he's innocent. 
TOBY: I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible. 
OSCAR: What are you talking about? I just did this now. 
TOBY: A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler.. 
OSCAR: Sure. 
TOBY: I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict. 
OSCAR: That's gotta be tough. 
TOBY: Tough? I put an innocent man on death row. 
NELLIE: The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time? 
DWIGHT: My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace! 
ERIN: That's yours? 
ANDY: That's the family boat! 
ERIN: Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous! 
ANDY: Right? 
ERIN: I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America. Boat 
GUY: Move. 
ANDY: Sorry? Boat 
GUY: Trying to rig a boat here. I don't know how to do that when you're standing in the way. 
ANDY: Sure, I um..I didn't know. Boat 
GUY: I'm not a ghost, so I can't walk through people. 
ANDY: Ok. 
ERIN: Gee, he was salty. 
ANDY: Geez, a little bit.  How you doing old buddy? Missed you. 
ERIN: What does that one do? 
ANDY: It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing. 
ERIN: I wish I had seen you do it. 
ANDY: Really? 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ANDY:  Up she goes! Boat 
GUY: Don't do that. Don't do that. 
ANDY: Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me. Boat 
GUY: Nope. Can't do that. 
ANDY: You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor.  Boat 
GUY: We've already started boarding. And no one is insured to rig her up right now except us. 
ANDY: You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just-  wow. Boat 
GUY: I can smack you all day if you keep touching what you're not supposed to touch. 
ANDY: Ok, fine. Boat 
GUY: OK. 
ANDY: Yeah, fine. Boat 
GUY: Good stuff. 
ANDY: Good stuff. Nice stuff.   Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah. 
ERIN: Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat. 
ANDY: I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it. 
ERIN: Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man. 
ANDY: Fine. But I could have. 
ERIN: As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain. 
ANDY: I am the captain. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ANDY: Right? 
ERIN: Yeah. 
ANDY: I'm the captain.  Hey, charm school. Boat 
GUY: What? 
ANDY: I'm taking it over from here. 
ERIN: Nice! Boat 
GUY: I hate to uh, ruin this moment...or breakdown, but you already signed the papers. So, if you want your boat back, you can pick it up there in the Bahamas in 10 days. 
ANDY: Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there. Boat 
GUY: OK, no. I already said, you're not getting back your deposit. 
ANDY: Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater? 
NELLIE: For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich. Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson . 
JIM:  Good afternoon!  
DWIGHT: Please sir! Spare him. Please. 
JIM: Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record! 
DWIGHT: Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in. 
NELLIE: Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace. 
ERIN: Do you even know what you're doing? 
ANDY: Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  Walt? Walt 
JR.: Oh god, thank goodness you're here. I was having a little trouble with this door. Yesterday. I um, I think it was yesterday. 
ANDY: I thought you were in rehab. Walt 
JR.: Yeah, uh, I just, I figured I'd get that first relapse out of the way. God, what's happened to our family? Everything is so messed up! How did you even know I was in here? 
ANDY: I didn't. I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat. But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda. 
ERIN: Bahamas, Andy. 
ANDY: Same thing.  Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on. David 
WALLACE:  Hello? 
DWIGHT: David, is that you? David 
WALLACE: Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok? David 
WALLACE: Yeah? Are you ok? 
DWIGHT: Oh, I'm OK. I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David. David 
WALLACE: Well, thanks Dwight. 
DWIGHT: You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok? David 
WALLACE: Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Walk out of the house... David 
WALLACE: What? 
DWIGHT: ...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison. David 
WALLACE: Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go. 
DWIGHT:  Wait a minute, you guys? You heard? 
ALL: Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! 
DWIGHT:  Shrute! Shrute! 
DWIGHT: Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected. 
KEVIN: Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information. 
OSCAR: Well, I am sorry Kevin. 
ANGELA: Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion? 
KEVIN: You know what Angela? I- Oh my god.  
ANGELA: Honey! What are you doing here? Senator 
LIPTOP: I just had a little intuition that someone I loved needed a little bit of attention today. Oscar, you're looking very healthy. Getting lots of vigorous exercise?  
OSCAR: No. 
ANGELA: Oscar? What is going on? What was that? Senator 
LIPTOP: What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't mean any offense. I was just trying to be friendly. 
OSCAR: You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who- 
KEVIN: Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support.  Senator 
LIPTOP: Well, thanks everybody. 
KEVIN: It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A! 
OSCAR: U..s..a. U- 
OSCAR: I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control. 
KEVIN: I totally forgot about the affair for a minute.  Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know.  Her life is a complete sham! 
ANDY: Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you. Do you realize that? You're the best ever! 
ERIN:  Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend. 
ANDY:  Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy! 
ERIN: Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic. 
ANDY:  I'll see you in three weeks! 
ERIN: OK! Walt 
JR.: Hey bro! It was here all along.  
ANDY: No way! Walt 
JR.: Way! 
ANDY: Erin I gotta go! Them's my chords! 
PETE: Hey. She's back. 
ERIN: Thanks for covering the phones. 
PETE: Yeah, no problem. How was it? 
ERIN: Fine. 
PETE: Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper. 
ERIN: Does he have a flipper? 
PETE: Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk. 
ERIN: He sounds like an idiot. 
PETE: Yeah, he is. 
ERIN: Ok. 
PETE: Ok. 
ERIN: Thanks. 
PETE: Yeah. 
ANDY:  Ah, what else? I ve seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times. Breaks my heart every time, you know? 
EVERYONE: Whoa! 
PAM: Andy. 
ANDY: That Swayze sure can dance dirty. 
PHYLLIS: Don t you have any sunblock? 
ANDY: No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes. They re like two flaming meatballs in my skull. 
ERIN: Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry. 
ANDY:  Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That s what I call the sun now. 
DARRYL: Andy, it s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head. 
ANDY: What else can I show you? Oh, damn it! 
ERIN: Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water? 
ANDY: Yeah, it was. That s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out. Ow! 
EVERYONE: Oh! 
ANDY: Ah! That s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know?  
DARRYL: He s been sailing for two days. 
ANDY:  I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains. 
ERIN:  Yeah. 
ANDY: No. No! Nooo!  
ERIN: Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh. 
DWIGHT:  Dwight Schrute.  Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town? 
DAVID:  Well, I have some very exciting news. 
DWIGHT: And you didn t call Jim - that seems significant. 
JIM: Hi, David. 
DAVID: Jim, good! You should hear this too. 
DWIGHT: No, he shouldn t. 
JIM:  Go ahead David, I m listening. 
DWIGHT: Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don t know where I d put you. 
DAVID: Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They ve apparently just dropped the supplier they ve been with for the last ten years. . 
DWIGHT: The White Pages. 
DWIGHT: The White 
PAGES: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing  the White Whale . Look at all that sweet blubber. 
DAVID: Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you. 
DWIGHT: I m gonna need to put you on hold for a second.  Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where s Stanley? 
ERIN: He s in the bathroom. 
DWIGHT: Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it? 
ERIN: Of course. 
DWIGHT: Yeah! Okay.  Hey David, I m back. 
ERIN:  Eat it Stanley! 
DWIGHT: So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account? 
DAVID: No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It s someone new but she didn t catch her name. 
DWIGHT: Her name? 
PHYLLIS: No, hey, Dwight shouldn t... 
DWIGHT: Shhh!  Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me! 
DAVID: Good luck! 
DWIGHT: Good luck to you.  
PHYLLIS: Dwight, you can t go. You have a problem with women. You can t sell to them. 
DWIGHT: That is a damnable lie. I love women. 
PHYLLIS: Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her  gy-na  for your entire meeting. 
NELLIE: Ew. That s not good. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, she said she corrected him five times. 
DWIGHT:  Gy-na  said that? 
PHYLLIS: Guys, we can t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back. 
MEREDITH: Hey remember that week in the 90 s when we got bagels? 
CREED: I miss Clinton. 
PAM: Can you go instead? 
JIM: I can t. I have the thing. 
JIM: I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong. 
PETE: Okay, call down. It s just me, not Tom Selleck. Guys in 
BREAKROOM:  
KEVIN: Nice! 
PETE: Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November. 
CLARK: So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time. 
DARRYL: Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh? 
TOBY: I have very fertile hair glands. 
TOBY: I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex. 
CLARK: God! 
TOBY: We even go to lunch, pick up babes. 
TOBY:  Smile if you love men s prostates. 
ANGELA: Hi. 
OSCAR: Hi. 
ANGELA: Spring cleaning? 
OSCAR: More like fall cleaning.  
ANGELA:  I think the senator is having an affair. 
OSCAR:  This doesn t... I m sorry. Wha... what? 
ANGELA: I think the senator is having an affair. 
OSCAR: I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela s husband spoon me back to bed. 
ANGELA: When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile. 
OSCAR: Oh, I m sure ...that s nothing. 
ANGELA: And he s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it s Hot Yoga with Blake. 
OSCAR: Angela, Blake s also a guy s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake? 
ANGELA: I don t know. 
OSCAR: I just never heard about the senator and yoga... 
ANGELA: Right. 
OSCAR: From you. I m sure it s probably nothing. But what s with the yoga already? 
ANGELA: Right? 
OSCAR: And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out. 
ANGELA: What? 
OSCAR: Angela, I ll go with you. 
PHYLLIS: So, uh, show us how you d normally sell to a female client. 
DWIGHT: Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog. 
PAM: You ve got this Schrute. 
PHYLLIS: Okay, you just walked into her office and begin. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
ERIN: Hello. 
DWIGHT: May I please speak to your boss? 
PHYLLIS: No, she is the boss. 
ERIN: I am? Hmm..  Hi, I m Mr. Hannon. How can I help you? 
DWIGHT: Okay, this isn t working for me,  cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss. 
ERIN: He s absolutely right. I m really struggling. 
PAM: Oh, I ll be the buyer. 
DWIGHT:  
PAM: Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat. 
DWIGHT: I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes 
PHYLLIS: No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs. 
DWIGHT: I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I m finished, it s over. 
PAM: Okay, let s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts? 
DWIGHT: I thought it went great. 
NELLIE: I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me? Business 
PARTNER:  Okay lets get started. 
JIM: Yeah, I m here. Are we all on? Business 
PARTNER: Uh,, well you re the only one  on  - we re all here. 
JIM:  Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months... 
KEVIN: That s the winter season., three months. 
JIM: I uh, I have some ideas, actually... Business 
PARTNER: Are you at your office right now? 
JIM:  Uh yeah. Trust me, I d rather be with you guys. Business 
PARTNER:  Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert. 
JIM: Oh,  Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh... Business 
PARTNER: Whoa.  I think there s been a bit of a mistake. We re trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman. 
JIM:  Um, you know what? I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell. Business 
PARTNER: Uh, yeah... 
JIM: I m gonna try a different spot. Okay? Business 
PARTNER: Okay, yeah. 
JIM: Okay, I ll call you right back. 
KEVIN: What s happening in three months? 
PAM: Okay, when you re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now? 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
PAM: Okay, well you have to show us. 
DWIGHT: That s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don t vibrate at all. 
PAM: Huh.  Uh huh. 
DWIGHT: What are you doing? 
PAM: A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it? 
DWIGHT: Kind of. 
PAM: Nellie, why don t you tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you re listening. 
NELLIE: Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking color schemes and the major themes we want to hit. Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper. But not in a child labor-y way. 
ERIN: It s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person. 
DWIGHT: I am a person. 
ERIN: Yes. 
NELLIE: And then we thought we d   I can t. I just can t carry on with that face. Look at it. I m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh. 
DWIGHT: That s a bit extreme. 
NELLIE: No, I m sorry but that is true. 
MEREDITH: He s screwed. They re meeting in less than an hour. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It s all garbage okay? You re the woman, I m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I m a woman.  I m a woman. Good? 
PHYLLIS: Ms. Thomas, so good to see you. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, are those your kids? They re so cute! They could be models. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. I m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina. 
MEREDITH: Booo! Weird. 
NELLIE: No. 
PHYLLIS: Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It s hopeless. 
PAM: Ten years ago, I didn t care if Dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I m like, that poor gimp is somebody s child. 
PAM: You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women. 
DWIGHT: Look, I have no problem with women. It s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don t lie about your shoulders! 
PAM: Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience? 
DWIGHT: I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently. 
PAM: Okay, so, when you re selling to this woman, just imagine that she s that nice, reasonable barber. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I can do that. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps. 
DWIGHT: He used to fight dogs. 
PAM: Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs? 
DWIGHT: Little of this, little of that. 
ANGELA: Which one is the instructor? There all fatties. 
OSCAR: Angela!  Angela. There. 
ANGELA: Where? 
OSCAR:  On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her. 
ANGELA: Oh my God! She s so stunningly tiny! She s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they re doing. 
OSCAR: She s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog. 
ANGELA:  I ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let s go. 
OSCAR: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... 
ANGELA: Ow. 
OSCAR: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look. 
PETE:  
TOBY: This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun. 
JIM: What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in -- Business 
PARTNER:  It was in what? Jim, we re having a lot of trouble hearing you. 
JIM: The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was... was in the... 
HANK: Hey! Are those skateboarders back? Business 
PARTNER:  Jim? Jim, are you there? 
HANK: Where are they? 
JIM: It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ... 
MEREDITH: Who was messing with my van? 
JIM: Nobody! Business 
PARTNER:  Jordan wore them for nobody? We re not following you, Halpert. 
JIM: No, no, no. 
HANK: This ends now! 
SECRETARY: Have a seat. Um, she will be right in. 
PAM: Oh, great. Oh, I m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don t have it. 
SECRETARY: Uh... um she ll be right in. 
PAM: Okay, great. 
DWIGHT:  Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it. 
PAM: Oh my God. It s Jan. 
DWIGHT: Oh, dear God in heaven. 
PAM: Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.  
JAN: You son of a bitch. You re firing me? Where the hell do you get off? 
PAM: Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that? 
PAM: Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It s so great to see you. 
JAN: Where s Wallace? 
PAM: What? 
JAN: I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct? 
DWIGHT: Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off.  
PAM: Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead. 
JAN: Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont. 
MOLLY: Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant. And I guess it did get a little confusing  cause you said not to tell anyone your name. And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them... 
JAN: Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan. 
MOLLY: I m so sorry Jan. 
JAN: I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing? 
DWIGHT: Listening. 
JAN: Stop. 
DWIGHT: Sorry. 
JAN: Stop that. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
PAM: So this was all just a trick. You don t really have any business to give? 
JAN: No, I do. 
PAM: But not to us. 
JAN: Insightful, Pam. 
PAM: You did good, Dwight. It s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan s not normal. Let s just go. She s not going to sell to us. 
DWIGHT: Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I ll be right back. 
PAM: What? 
JAN: Pam? 
PAM: Yeah. 
JAN: I m a very busy woman, so... 
PAM: Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid? 
JAN: Fine. I will show you one... slide show. 
PETE: Erin, did this call... 
ERIN: Uh! 
PETE: What? 
ERIN: Sorry, I uh, just saw your face. 
PETE: Oh, I m sorry. It s for the thing. 
ERIN: I know. That s great. It just - it makes it look like there s an eyebrow in the middle of your face. 
PETE: Wow. 
ERIN: A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn t bad. 
PETE: Uh-huh. 
ERIN: But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It s such a great cause. 
PETE: Yeah. 
ERIN:  
JAN:  Mommy, you re a princess. Mommy, you re a superstar. Mommy you re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es? 
PAM: Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever. 
JAN: Aw. 
PAM: And it is so cute how she signs her name. 
JAN:  Well, that -- that was -- that was me too. 
PAM: Oh, okay. It s just that s how Cece does it with the backwards  E s. 
JAN: Cece can t spell her name. 
PAM: Oh, actually she can. 
JAN: Well, it s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean,  Cece  is two letters and  Astrid  is... I mean, there s even some adults who -- who -- who can t spell it. 
PAM: Of course. 
JAN: Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam. 
PAM: Um...  A ...  X ? I don t -- you got me. 
JAN: Don t patronize me. 
PAM:  I m so sorry. I hate this. You re better. 
ANGELA:  Okay, we should go now. Let s go. 
OSCAR:  Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch.  
ANGELA: Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can t get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on fire -- 
OSCAR:  Please. It s Robert who s enjoying it. 
ANGELA: What? 
OSCAR: This could be the affair that you re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are.  But uh, he s probably not gay. He s straight. He s straight, so... 
PAM: Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water? 
JAN: No. 
DWIGHT: Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes. 
PAM: Oh, my God. 
CLARK: Where s the Quizno s? 
DWIGHT: You re the Quizno s.  Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name? 
JAN: I -- I -- 
DWIGHT: Hmm? 
JAN: I don t recall. And yes, Molly is crap. 
PAM: Okay, you do not have to do this. 
CLARK: Do what? Get into sales? That s what I want. 
DWIGHT: He s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young. 
JAN: Will you uh,  you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business. 
DWIGHT: Very good. 
JAN:  Do you have a valid passport? 
JIM: Jim Halpert. 
COLIN:  Hey, it s Colin. 
JIM: Hey man. I am so sorry about that. 
COLIN: I know. Don t worry about it. 
JIM:  
COLIN: It s just... it s not totally working. 
JIM: Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don t worry. I ll figure it out. 
COLIN: Yeah, well, it s not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don t know how we re gonna do this. 
JIM: Uh, what does -- what does that mean? 
ANGELA: Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay? 
OSCAR: I don t know, Angela. I m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go. 
ANGELA: Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing? 
OSCAR: He s making a phone call. 
ANGELA:  Oh. Oh. 
OSCAR:  
PAM: Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit. 
MOLLY: Thanks. Okay. 
DWIGHT: Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings. 
PAM: Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number. 
DWIGHT: Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL. 
PAM: That s a license number? 
DWIGHT: That s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know. 
PAM: Oh. Why me? 
DWIGHT: Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It s like air to you people. Ugh, God.  
OSCAR: Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it s business as usual. 
OSCAR: Good morning.  
ANGELA: Oscar...  can I ask you a question? 
OSCAR:  Of course, ask me a que-- questions. 
ANGELA: Is it cool in here to you? 
OSCAR:  Yes, a little bit.  Yes. 
ANGELA: I think the thermostat is acting up again. 
OSCAR: It s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I ll just go downstairs. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
OSCAR: No, thank you, Angela. 
OSCAR: She doesn t know. I shouldn t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love. 
DWIGHT: Well, well, well, it s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring. 
PAM: These are my painting clothes.I think I m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.  
MEREDITH: Sure you don t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one. 
JIM: You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started? 
PAM: Are you avoiding your phone call? 
JIM: What? Yeah, right. As if. 
JIM: Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there. 
PAM: Last week Jim wasn t there, and they named the company Athlead. 
JIM: I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace. 
PAM: Tell them your opening line. 
JIM:  Hey David, how would you like a guy who s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia? 
PAM: I think it s good. He likes fishing. 
JIM: This is gonna be awful. 
PETE: One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to  chillax,  and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. Fight the power. 
ANGELA: Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you. 
ANGELA:  Ugh! 
DWIGHT: Come on in, the water s fine. 
ANGELA: Dwight, it s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on. 
DWIGHT: I know. That s not why I m naked. I always work out without my clothes.  
ANGELA: Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh. 
DWIGHT: Oh, I m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I m not in your panties, I don t go vigilantes. Why don t you ask your husband? 
ANGELA: My marriage is in danger. I don t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me. 
DWIGHT:  All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping? 
ANGELA: Something like that. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force. 
ANGELA: Can you arrange a meeting? 
DWIGHT: I can try. I m gonna use SMS text. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Text went through. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
DWIGHT: All we can do is sit and wait. 
ANGELA: Okay. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, look at that. Yeah, he s free anytime. Not a problem. 
JIM: I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly. 
DAVID:  Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there s a crisis -- the more I think about it -- 
JIM: Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I m gone. 
DAVID: They did? 
JIM: Yep. 
DAVID: Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work. 
JIM: Oh, great. 
STANLEY: Why should we help you? 
JIM: Because we re friends. 
STANLEY: When is my birthday? 
JIM: Unfair. When s my birthday? 
STANLEY: I don t know, because we re not friends. 
JIM: How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case? 
STANLEY: Now we re talkin . 
JIM: All right. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. 
KEVIN: Make it go taller. 
PETE: That s the idea. 
KEVIN: No, not taller this way, taller this way.  
PETE: Well, I ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher. 
KEVIN: You re not getting this, Peter. Make it go wider... up! 
PETE: Will do. 
DARRYL:  What are y all doing? 
KEVIN: Me and Pete are building a tower. 
DARRYL: Cool. It should be taller though, right? 
KEVIN: Obviously. He s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he s not the sharpest guy in the drawer. 
PETE: Kevin, I can hear you. 
KEVIN: Huh? 
ANGELA: Ow! Dwight! Ow! 
DWIGHT: Get in the van. 
ANGELA: God! 
TREVOR: Is it safe to talk? 
DWIGHT: Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don t see them so I think we re good. 
ANGELA: So what are your credentials? 
TREVOR: I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I m damn good at it. 
ANGELA: Do you have a gun? 
DWIGHT:  Does he own a gun? Show her. 
TREVOR: You tell me. 
ANGELA: What is this? 
TREVOR: It s the receipt for my gun. 
ANGELA: You don t carry it with you? 
TREVOR: Read the receipt. That s a $300 gun. Someone could steal it. 
DWIGHT: Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor s had stolen from him? 
TREVOR: Now I keep it in a safe. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hmm. Good safe? 
TREVOR: Oh, you tell me.  
DWIGHT: Wow! 
PAM:  I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I m gonna limit myself to one shrub. 
HIDE: You paint wall now? 
PAM: Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that... 
HIDE: You paint now. 
PAM: It s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing. 
HIDE: I wait. 
MEREDITH: Sweet. 
ERIN: Yay! 
DARRYL: That s what I m talkin  about. 
PETE: This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote  sausage factory.  
MEREDITH: Oh OOOH! 
EVERYONE:  
MEREDITH: Boom! 
DARRYL: Bang. 
KEVIN: Yep, yep, yep. 
PETE: All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed. 
CREED: Let s find out what I did. 
PETE: All right. 
DWIGHT: You get half now and half upon completion of said job. 
TREVOR: And that s all off the books? 
ANGELA: Obviously. 
TREVOR: Nice. No taxes. 
ANGELA: Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here. 
TREVOR: So what s the job? 
ANGELA: Murder. 
TREVOR: Okay, that s the big one. That s the big  M.  
DWIGHT: You can t have someone murdered. 
ANGELA: What if they deserved it? 
DWIGHT: What did they do to you, Angela? 
ANGELA: They re sleeping with my husband. 
DWIGHT: Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you. 
TREVOR: This seems a little crazy. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Crazy. Thank you. 
TREVOR: But I think I m up for it. 
DWIGHT: No! No! 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch-- 
TREVOR: That s very effective. I ve been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It s devastating. 
ANGELA: No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer. 
TREVOR: What about a knee-capping? 
DWIGHT: No! You re not helping, Trevor! 
ANGELA: Yes, a knee-capping could work. 
DWIGHT: No. Angela! What are you saying? 
ANGELA: You said you would be there for me. 
DWIGHT: I m trying, but what you re asking is-- 
ANGELA: It s the only thing that will make this right. 
DWIGHT: Okay. But it s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can t scrub worth a damn. 
TREVOR: All right, then it s settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4:00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there s no turning back. 
JIM: You know, truth be told, I think all you ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I m gone. 
STANLEY: We ve got all afternoon to talk about that. 
WAITER: Morning, folks. 
STANLEY: I ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster. 
WAITER: Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob-- 
STANLEY: Not enough lobster. Side order. 
PHYLLIS: How much wine do you have? 
OSCAR: I brought you a cookie. 
ANGELA: Oh, thanks, Oscar. You re such an angel. 
OSCAR:  I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we re good. Yeah.  We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye. 
PETE: There we go. 
EVERYONE:  
PETE: Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex. 
NELLIE: Oooohh... you salty dog. 
DARRYL: Well, yeah, what can I say, a player s gotta play. 
PETE: There you go. 
DARRYL: Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I m gonna let them think the other thing. 
KEVIN: Okay, I got this one. 
NELLIE: Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful 
KEVIN: No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath. 
EVERYONE:  Oh no! Kevin! 
NELLIE: What did I just say? What did I just say? 
PETE: Hey, hey, hey, it s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That s what this tower s all about -- mistakes. Okay, if you re afraid of screwing up, the tower s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in? 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
PETE: There we go. All right, let s do it. 
JIM: You know, at the end of the day, it s really only two days. I mean, I ll be back in the office. If you need me for an emergency, call me. I ll be there... 
PHYLLIS: You know what? I don t know where the years went.  Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don t even recognize them. 
JIM: Tell me about it. 
PHYLLIS: Whose hands are these?  Theyre not my hands. I don t know. 
JIM: All right. You know what? Maybe we ll just... We ll go slow. 
PHYLLIS: No. Jim...  
PETE: All right. Check it out. 
EVERYONE:  
PETE: Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh! 
KEVIN: Nice. Pretty soon, we re gonna be at the ceiling. 
ERIN: Whoo! 
PETE: Can you hand me a card? 
ERIN: Um,. it s empty. 
PETE: What? 
NELLIE: Oh, come on. We could use a blank card. 
EVERYONE: No!! 
MEREDITH: That s cheating. 
PAM: I could get us a complaint. 
MEREDITH: You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn t fart on a butterfly. 
PAM: No, I wouldn t. I can t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I d like to try. 
NELLIE: Hmm. Yeah. All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam... 
EVERYONE:   Pam!  
ANGELA: What? Why did you call me out here? 
DWIGHT: The target-- it s Oscar, isn t it? He and the senator are gaying each other. 
ANGELA: I don t know what you re talking about. 
DWIGHT: Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils. 
ANGELA: Fine! It s Oscar. So what? 
DWIGHT: Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend? 
ANGELA: Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband. 
DWIGHT: I can t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me. 
ANGELA: Well, you might be right. But it s too late now. 
DWIGHT: What do you mean? 
ANGELA: He s here. 
DWIGHT: No! No, no!  
DWIGHT: Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me. 
OSCAR: What? 
DWIGHT: Come -- come with me. 
OSCAR: What are you doing? 
DWIGHT: There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They re extraordinary. 
MEREDITH: Yahtzee. 
TREVOR: Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez. 
KEVIN: I am Oscar Martinez. 
ANGELA: No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside. 
KEVIN: Wha-- wh-- 
ANGELA: You know, there s doughnuts in the break room. 
KEVIN: Nice! Yeah. 
JIM: Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over. 
STANLEY: Don t be pushy Jim. It s tacky. 
JIM: All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that s-- that s decorative. 
PHYLLIS: No, there s wine in here. 
JIM: Still decorative. 
STANLEY: Is it white wine? 
JIM: No. 
PHYLLIS:  Can you help me? 
JIM: Don t-- don t-- don t pole people with knives. 
PHYLLIS:  ha ha! 
JIM: Phyllis! Wow. 
STANLEY: Ooh, bring it over. 
PHYLLIS: Got it. 
DWIGHT: There s no time to explain.  Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps. 
OSCAR: Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you? 
DWIGHT: What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who s the father of her child? 
OSCAR: I don t know what you re talking about. 
DWIGHT: Oh, don t lie. I m trying to save those precious knees you re always bragging about. Now, let s get out of here. He could be right behind us. 
DWIGHT: Aah! Actually, he s right in front of us. 
TREVOR: Let s get it on. I m gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I m gonna do this. 
DWIGHT: No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He s my tribe. 
TREVOR: I m sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I m gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No! 
OSCAR: I got it. 
DWIGHT: Disarm! 
TREVOR: You don t--  
DWIGHT: Don t move. And disarm now!  
TREVOR: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
DWIGHT: No! No, Oscar. He s a friend. He s a friend. 
ERIN: Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They re family-owned, but don t let that take away from your edge! 
NELLIE: Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you. 
CREED: Remember, you re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this. 
PAM:  Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell,  Hey, kool-aid.  Yeah, your mama s fat. This is Pam Halpert. 
PETE: Did she buy it? 
PAM: Basically I couldn t tell, but I think... 
NELLIE: Were they angry? 
PAM: I-- I thought they were confused at least... 
NELLIE: Okay.  
ERIN: Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file.  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client! 
EVERYONE:  
KEVIN: Nice. Nice. 
CREED: You did good. You did good. 
PETE: See ya later, Heymont. 
DWIGHT: No. 
TREVOR: If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend. 
OSCAR: What the hell, Dwight? 
DWIGHT: See ya later, Trevor. 
OSCAR: you are incorrigible! 
DWIGHT: I just saved your life. You re welcome! 
OSCAR: You hired someone to hit me with a pipe! 
ANGELA: You deserved every bit of it! You made my husband gay. 
OSCAR: What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him! 
ANGELA: No. No. 
OSCAR: Angela, until you face that, you re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me. 
ANGELA: Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you. 
OSCAR: Angela, it s a lead freaking pipe. 
ANGELA: God!  
OSCAR: Aah! 
ANGELA: You were supposed to be my friend. 
OSCAR: I m so sorry. Angela-- 
DWIGHT: Oscar. 
PETE: Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert... 
EVERYONE:  
PETE: For insulting a client s recently deceased mother. 
NELLIE: Yes! 
PAM: I did not know that. 
PETE: Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life. 
PAM: I m so sorry. 
MEREDITH: Wow. 
PETE: yeah. That s-- that is terrible. 
EVERYONE:  
KEVIN: You did it. 
ERIN: Yeah! 
ANGELA: I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day. 
DWIGHT: You re not stupid. Jazz is stupid. 
ANGELA:  Jazz is stupid! I mean, just play the right notes! 
DWIGHT: I know. You re gonna be okay, Monkey. 
ANGELA: I don t like your friend Trevor. 
DWIGHT: I don t like him either. And yet I really like him. 
JIM: Well, we re here. Perfect.  
PHYLLIS: We re gonna cover for you, ya know. 
STANLEY:  
JIM: Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or-- 
STANLEY:  I did enjoy grinding your beans, son. 
PHYLLIS:  Yeah, we really did peel your grapes. 
JIM: This is hilarious, but we re gonna stop with all-- 
STANLEY: Shuckin  your peas. 
JIM: Shuckin  the peas. You should go back to the first part, though. You are gonna cover for me? 
STANLEY: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys. 
JIM: Oh, my God, thank you.  Thank you. 
PAM: If you re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea that you can t please everybody all the time. 
HIDE: You paint very bad-- 
PAM: Shut up, Hide! I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I m okay with that. 
DWIGHT: Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted? 
TOBY: That is-- that is a loaded question. 
ANGELA: My pastor said it can come from breast feeding. 
TOBY: He said that? 
ANGELA: Well, he didn t fight me hard on it. 
TOBY: I-- I don t know if there s truth to-- to, uh, to that. 
ANGELA: What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet? 
TOBY: Oh... uh... 
ANGELA: Is it called red-vining? 
DWIGHT: Is it called red-vining? 
TOBY: I don t... 
DWIGHT: We heard it was called red-vining. 
ANGELA: People red vine. 
DWIGHT: Where are gay mens  vaginas? 
TOBY: They don t have vaginas. 
DWIGHT: What? 
TOBY: No. They re just regular men. 
DWIGHT: When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person s penis? 
TOBY: Uh... wow.... 
JIM:  I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes. 
PAM: I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt. 
JIM: Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness? 
JIM: I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking. 
DWIGHT: Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever. 
JIM: So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word "Philadelphia"? 
DWIGHT: Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning "Love," and adelph, meaning "Adolf." "the city that loves Adolf." Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.  
ERIN: Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone! 
ANGELA: No. 
NELLIE: Is It? 
ERIN: I mean, it says "X-Mas party," but I think we all know what that's code for. 
KEVIN: So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us? 
ANGELA: Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee. 
KEVIN: Well, you are the one in charge of it. 
ANGELA: Don't blame me for something we all forgot. 
OSCAR: Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot. 
OSCAR: I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points. 
PHYLLIS: I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works. 
MEREDITH:  We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party! 
NELLIE: Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes? 
KEVIN: Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people? 
DWIGHT: What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel. 
JIM: Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement? 
KEVIN: No. 
ANGELA: No! 
JIM: Done, right? 
ANGELA: No. 
STANLEY: No. I want Tropical Christmas. 
MEREDITH: Topless Christmas. 
CREED: Tapas swiss miss. 
CREED: Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand? 
DWIGHT: Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular. 
PHYLLIS: We already said no. 
ANGELA: No, no, no. 
NELLIE: Too weird. 
DWIGHT:  This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style. 
JIM: I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy? 
ANGELA:  Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now. 
PAM: I'm on it. 
JIM: Right. 
PETE: I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses. 
ERIN: Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain. 
PETE: Die hard reference. 
ERIN: I haven't seen it. 
PETE: You haven't seen die hard? 
ERIN: Mm-Mmm. 
PETE: Why haven't you seen die hard? 
ERIN: I don't know, I just haven't. 
KEVIN: Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it. 
ERIN: No. 
KEVIN: "now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho." 
PETE: "Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs." 
ERIN: None of this makes any sense to me! 
KEVIN: Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, "Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--" 
PETE: Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans. 
KEVIN: Yes, you are right. Forgive me. 
PETE: Oh, that's okay, bud. 
KEVIN: Nope.  
PETE: Common mistake. 
KEVIN: No, it's not. 
ERIN:  Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie? 
PETE: My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it. 
ERIN: Okay, let's hear it. 
PETE: Hear what? 
ERIN: Die hard. Every line. Go. 
PETE: "You don't like flying, do you?" 
ERIN: Don't change the subject. 
PETE: No, that's the-- 
ERIN: Movie is starting. 
JIM:  We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work. 
STANLEY: I love Philly. Dirty town. 
DARRYL:  Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man. 
JIM: Whoo! 
DARRYL: So you sure you remembered everything for your trip? 
JIM: Yeah, I think so. 
DARRYL: Think that through for a sec. 
DARRYL: Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right? 
DARRYL: What else could you possibly be forgetting? 
JIM: Uh-- 
DARRYL: Things? People?  
TOBY: You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison  for something he may not have done. 
NELLIE: I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who? 
TOBY: The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago? 
NELLIE:  Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.  
TOBY: I--I could--I could talk about it. 
STANLEY:  See you next Christmas. 
TOBY: I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back. 
PAM: We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us. 
PHYLLIS: Let's do it! 
PAM: Yes! Phyllis! 
ANGELA: No. I don't want my name attached to this party. 
PAM: What does that even mean? Where would your name appear? 
ANGELA: Please just take my name off of everything. 
OSCAR: Just take her name off of everything.  
PAM:  The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas. 
DWIGHT: Yes! Yeah!  Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle!  Yeah! Whoo-Hoo! 
PAM: Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously. 
DWIGHT: Uh-huh. 
PAM: And that is... 
DWIGHT: Uh, Oh. 
PAM: That there are no rules. 
DWIGHT: You have never been cooler. 
JIM: Best Christmas ever. 
PAM: You're welcome. 
JIM: Thank you. 
DWIGHT:  And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun. 
MEREDITH: Ugh. What is this stuff, lava? 
DWIGHT: That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy. 
PAM: What is it?  Don't touch it. 
DWIGHT:  Somebody's found the hog maw. 
PAM: Oh! 
DWIGHT: What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it. 
STANLEY: Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat. 
DWIGHT: It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib. 
JIM: Can't wait. 
MEREDITH: Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine? 
DWIGHT: This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces. 
OSCAR: How would anyone even know-- 
DWIGHT: Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook? 
JIM: I don't know. Is it what you expected? 
PAM: I feel like --Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem. 
JIM: So happy right now.  
DWIGHT:  Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange.  Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump. 
KEVIN: I wish my car had a bathroom. 
PETE: "Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--" 
ERIN:  Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete. 
PETE: That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes. 
ERIN: I don't know. This looks pretty legit.  Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land. 
ERIN:  "What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates."  
PETE: Hey. Everything okay? 
ERIN: So what comes next? 
PETE: Right, um, okay. So he says, uh,  "After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--" 
ERIN: We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense. 
PETE: Or we can just sit and talk, though. 
ERIN: No. No more talking. It's movie time. 
PETE: I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car. 
ERIN: Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan. 
PETE: Okay. 
TOBY:  Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight. 
KEVIN:  I love this hog mama. 
PHYLLIS: Dwight said it's "Hog maw." 
KEVIN:  What is maw?!  
PHYLLIS: It's the lining of the stomach of-- 
DWIGHT:  Ohh... Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I! 
JIM: Yes, he is finally nigh. 
DWIGHT: I am nigh! 
DWIGHT: Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel. 
DWIGHT: Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo!  Ohh...Too much strudel. 
JIM: So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse. 
DWIGHT: No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel. 
JIM: Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority. 
PAM: And the fear. 
DWIGHT: Yes, exactly! 
PHYLLIS: Come on, Dwight, you're making this up. 
DWIGHT: No. 
OSCAR:  This is a real thing. "Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany." 
ANGELA: Huh. 
PAM: Wow. 
DWIGHT: Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia? 
OSCAR:  "His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface." 
STANLEY: Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No. 
DWIGHT: Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys.    
PETE: Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy? 
ERIN: Mm.   
DARRYL:  Jim, that guy.  You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy?  It's awful. 
DWIGHT: Take a bowl and pass it down. 
PHYLLIS: Thank you, Dwight. These are nice. 
DWIGHT: No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable. 
JIM: Oh, it's like naughty or nice. 
DWIGHT: No, impish or admirable. 
JIM: Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list? 
DWIGHT: I decided earlier. 
JIM: Oh, nice. Did you check that list? 
DWIGHT: Of course I checked it. 
JIM: But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake. 
DWIGHT: I checked it more than once. 
JIM: Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's-- 
DWIGHT: Impish or admirable. 
JIM: Damn. 
DWIGHT: Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable.  There you are. 
PHYLLIS:  Oh. What are these? 
DWIGHT: It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars. 
PHYLLIS: I'd rather have the bowl. 
DWIGHT: You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year ...as impish!   
OSCAR: Ow! You hit people with that thing? 
DWIGHT: No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder  
JIM: Ooh. 
PAM:  Mouse trap.  
DWIGHT: In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.  
JIM: Oh, you know what? I gotta go. 
DWIGHT: Stop giggling. 
PAM: Oh, really? Already? 
JIM: Yeah, it's all right. 
DWIGHT: It's a punishment.  Hey, where are you going? 
JIM: I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay. 
DWIGHT: But you work tomorrow. 
JIM: Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep. 
DWIGHT: But we were gonna break the pig rib. 
JIM: Ooh. 
DWIGHT: Remember? 
JIM: That's right. 
DWIGHT: No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you! 
JIM: Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody. 
DWIGHT: Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present? 
JIM: You know what? Yeah. Have at it. 
DWIGHT: Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here!  I judge your year as impish.  
JIM: Ooh! Are you nuts? 
DWIGHT:  I judge you impish! 
JIM: Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard. 
DWIGHT: They're not abandoning the party.  
JIM: Just--Just--Hey!  
JIM:  That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh! 
DWIGHT:  Impish!  
JIM: Aah! Ow! 
MEREDITH: Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too.   
JIM:  Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God.  One second. Oh... 
PAM: Well...this is it. 
JIM: I'm probably never gonna see you again. 
PAM: Shut up. I'm trying to be serious. 
JIM: Okay, sorry, sorry. 
PAM: I can't believe this is actually happening. 
JIM: Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck. 
PAM: Okay.  Good luck. You're gonna be great. 
JIM: I'll call you when I get in. 
PAM: Okay. 
JIM: All right. 
PAM: Love you. 
JIM: Love you.  
PAM: What's going on? 
DWIGHT: Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you.  And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight!   
PHYLLIS: We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.  
ANGELA: Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it! 
NELLIE: Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there. 
TOBY: Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting. 
DARRYL: Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.  
DARRYL:  Boo! 
PAM: For what it's worth, I liked your party better. 
DWIGHT: Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak. 
PAM: I don't think anyone thought that. 
DWIGHT: Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party. 
PAM: Well, that didn't have anything to do with you. 
DWIGHT: I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten. 
PAM: Zero. 
DWIGHT: Damn It! 
DARRYL: I'm gonna tell Jim to go  himself. 
ERIN: Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me? 
PETE: Yeah. Definitely.  Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here.  Hey, hey. Come on, huh? 
ERIN:  I'm still Andy's girlfriend. 
PETE: Oh, yeah, of course. I know. 
ERIN: But you can leave your arm.   
PAM: Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog? 
DWIGHT: No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt. 
JIM:  Yep, I did say that. 
PAM: Jim! 
JIM: What's going on? Where's the belsnickel? 
PAM: Oh--Oh my god!  
JIM: What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building. 
DWIGHT:  Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash!  
PAM: What happened? Did you miss your bus? 
JIM: No. I just missed my wife. 
DWIGHT:  I found it! 
JIM: And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.  
DWIGHT: Oh!  Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.  
DARRYL:  Back for more, huh?  
JIM: Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog.  Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy? 
DARRYL: You! 
JIM: Oh, hey, man.  Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview. 
DARRYL:  That's great. 
JIM: Right? 
DARRYL: Thanks, man. 
JIM: Hey, of course. 
DARRYL: I shall come by at your convenience. 
JIM: Thank you, sir.  
DARRYL:  Whoo! 
JIM: Go get 'em. 
DARRYL:  Oh! Whoa!  
DWIGHT: Very impish.  
TOBY: Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and-- 
NELLIE: Shh.  
TOBY: What? I was just explaining-- 
NELLIE: Shh. 
TOBY: Why wouldn't it-- 
NELLIE:  Shh. 
TOBY: But why? 
NELLIE: No...more...talking. 
TOBY: Are you gonna kiss me? 
NELLIE: Yes.   
KEVIN: To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops. 
JIM: I think they're going to the conference finals. 
KEVIN: No. 
JIM: Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-...  
JIM: I bit my lip at lunch today. 
DARRYL: Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough. 
KEVIN: Oh, the Nets are super tough.  
JIM: Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it. 
KEVIN: The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible. 
JIM: Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the...  
JIM: Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen... You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home! 
ERIN: Good morning, Meredith. 
PAM: What? 
ERIN: Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes. 
PAM: Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family. 
JIM: I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos. 
JIM:  You sound tired. Everything ok? 
PAM: Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting? 
JIM: Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right? 
WORKER: Jim, limo's here. 
JIM: Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting. 
PAM: Oh, call me later! 
JIM: Ok 
PAM: Good luck! 
JIM: Thanks! 
PAM: Love you. 
JIM: Love you too. Bye. 
VAL: How you doing? 
DARRYL: Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so... 
VAL: It's how it has to be. 
DARRYL: I know, I know. It's just hard. 
DARRYL: Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, "What are you gonna do, breakup with me?" Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight. 
DARRYL: I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it. 
VAL: Me neither. Come here.  
PAM: Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today. 
MEREDITH: Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you. 
PAM: He didn't leave me. He just went part time.  Can you just fill out the form please? 
MEREDITH: Yes. 
PAM: I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens. 
MEREDITH: Hurry up already. 
ERIN:  Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times. 
ERIN: Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice! 
ANGELA: Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower? 
DWIGHT: What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine. 
PAM: Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly. 
DWIGHT: Just lice Pam? 
DWIGHT: Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7. 
DWIGHT: Make way, nope, inspect me. 
ERIN: Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear. 
DWIGHT: Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.  
PAM: Stop that! 
ANGELA: Dwight! 
ERIN: Next! 
ANGELA:  Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies. 
PAM: Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault. 
OSCAR: Pam, really? Come on. 
MEREDITH: Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen. 
ERIN: Lice. More lice.  Angela has lice. 
ANGELA: Ew! Oh. 
ERIN:  Ooh yabber, lice! 
ERIN:  Yikers, lice. 
PAM: No! How? I'm so clean! 
ERIN:  Oh yeah, big time lice. 
OSCAR: I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith. 
PHYLLIS: What are you wearing? 
DWIGHT: It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free?  Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits? 
NELLIE: No. 
KEVIN: No. 
DWIGHT: Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch. 
DARRYL: Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up. 
PHYLLIS: You got dumped? 
DARRYL: Yeah, she ended things. 
NELLIE: Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink. 
KEVIN: Here man.  You need that more than me. 
DARRYL: Thanks, man. 
KEVIN: Yeah  
PAM: Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her. 
ANGELA: Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame. 
STANLEY: That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day. 
ERIN: No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house!  
STANLEY: Get off me! 
ERIN: I'm trying to save you from yourself! 
STANLEY: Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls. 
PAM: Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me. 
JIM: Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary? Limo 
DRIVER: Yeah, take some home if you want. 
JIM: Oh no, no, no. That's ok.  Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center? Limo 
DRIVER: No, Mr. Irving called. Said he'd rather meet you at his private court. 
JIM: You gotta be kidding me. 
PAM: Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something. 
MEREDITH:  Yes, Pam what do you want? 
PAM: Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!? 
MEREDITH: Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice. 
PAM: Oh stop! I am so sorry! 
MEREDITH: Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying? 
PAM: Nothing. 
PAM: I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this. 
DWIGHT: Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed! 
ERIN: No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats... 
DWIGHT: To be burned! 
ERIN: To be washed. 
ANGELA: What do we do about our heads? 
DWIGHT: I'm not gonna lie. Lye! 
ERIN: No, all we need is mayonnaise. 
ANGELA: Excuse me? 
PAM: She's right, it works. I would imagine. 
ERIN: Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos. 
OSCAR: I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce. 
MEREDITH:  Shaboom! How do you like me now!? 
ANGELA: Oh. 
OSCAR: Wow. 
MEREDITH: Take a picture. It will last longer. 
ANGELA: We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible. 
CREED: Bald people make me sick. 
MEREDITH: Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss. 
ERIN: Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now. 
PAM: Oh! Uh, uh I'll go. 
ANGELA: Okay. Oh, thank you. 
OSCAR: You're a saint, Pam. 
PAM: No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans? 
MEREDITH: Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools. 
PAM: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Let's talk pubes, people. 
VAL: Hey, Darryl. 
DARRYL: Oh, hey Val. 
NELLIE: Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other. 
DARRYL: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: What's gonna make you feel better, big guy? 
DARRYL: When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head. 
NELLIE: Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this. 
KEVIN: I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake. 
PHYLLIS: Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake. 
NELLIE: Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most. 
KEVIN: An Escalade. 
NELLIE: Or what's her name. 
PHYLLIS: Val. 
NELLIE: Let's get Darryl Val. Julius 
IRVING: I hope you don't mind me bringing you out here. I can't get my knees under a desk. 
JIM: Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this. 
JULIUS: Well, do you think you can sink one from deep? 
JIM: Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball. 
JULIUS: Okay.  Wow, Halpert's got game. 
JIM: Alright.  Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this? 
JULIUS: It's your wife? You better take it. 
JIM: Right!  Hey, what's up? Everything ok? 
PAM: Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went. 
JIM: It's still happening right now actually, so uh... 
PAM: He's really making you work for it, huh? 
JIM: Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay? 
PAM: Great. I am killing it over here.  Jim, I gotta go. 
JIM: Okay, bye.  So sorry about that. 
JULIUS: No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think? 
JIM: I love it. 
ERIN:  Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away. 
DWIGHT: Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right.  
STANLEY: Put those away before you hurt yourself. 
DWIGHT:  Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No! 
ERIN: Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up. 
ANGELA: Oscar, do you want to be my partner? 
OSCAR: Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to.. 
CREED: Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay? 
ERIN: Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete? 
PETE: Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man. 
PAM: Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy? 
CREED: Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo. 
OSCAR:  Angela. 
ANGELA: You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up? 
MEREDITH:  You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more. 
PAM:  Creed, I'm all done. My turn. 
CREED: I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy. 
PAM: Well, wait. 
PETE:  How's that? 
ERIN: I feel it working.  Eiffel tower! 
VAL: Can I help you? 
PHYLLIS: Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl. 
VAL: Yeah, that's true. 
PHYLLIS: We think you made a big, big mistake. 
KEVIN: Big mistake. 
NELLIE: Quite enormous. 
PHYLLIS: He's a real catch and you should take him back. 
VAL: Ok, thank you. Is that all? 
NELLIE: No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you? 
VAL: Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay? 
KEVIN: So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back? 
VAL: No. 
KEVIN: Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever. 
VAL: Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out. 
PAM:  Hello? 
HELENE:  Hi, honey, it's mom. Look, Cece's school just called. She still has lice. 
PAM: What, no. That can't...I don't... 
HELENE: Now, don't worry, don't worry. I'm on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like... 
ANGELA: Oh my God. 
MEREDITH: Shave her head. Shave her head! 
PAM: You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that... 
MEREDITH: Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall. 
DWIGHT:  She's right Pam. 
PAM: Is there a volume knob on that thing? 
DWIGHT: Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing. 
PAM: Meredith, I am so sorry. 
ANGELA: Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster. 
PAM: I meant to say something earlier. I just... 
MEREDITH: Just? Just what? Just forgot? 
MEREDITH: Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam. 
DWIGHT: Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as... 
ERIN: Dwight, are you okay!? 
DWIGHT: Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple.  
ERIN: Wow. He got to purple. 
OSCAR:  Ow! 
ANGELA: Sorry. 
OSCAR: You're waterboarding me! 
ANGELA: Oops. 
KEVIN:  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay. 
ERIN: You're up. 
PETE: Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go. 
ERIN: You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out. 
PETE: Okay. 
ERIN: Okay. Okay.  Is that too cold? 
PETE: No, it actually feels kinda nice. 
KEVIN: I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time.  
VAL: Okay. 
DARRYL: Huh? 
VAL: Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work. 
DARRYL: Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do. 
VAL: You're not. I believe in us. 
DARRYL: But...  
DARRYL: I'm back together with Val. Yay... 
DWIGHT: I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere.  
PETE: Hey, did Erin already take off? 
OSCAR: I guess so. 
PETE: Okay. 
JULIUS: You're Kareem, coming to help. 
JIM: Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud. 
JULIUS: And it went like this.  
JIM: And that's all? 
JULIUS: That's it. 
JIM: No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done. 
JULIUS: Yeah, you show me how. 
JIM:  This is Jim Halpert, leave a message. 
PAM: Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you. 
MEREDITH: Hey, what you doing right now? 
PAM: I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day. 
MEREDITH: Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer. 
PAM: Really? A beer sounds incredible right now. 
MEREDITH: No duh. Let's go. You're buying. 
PAM: Meredith, I am so sorry about today. 
MEREDITH: Forget about it. 
PAM: I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it. 
MEREDITH: Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over. 
PAM: Get it, girl! 
PAM:  This one's for all you ladies out there. 
MEREDITH:  I come... 
PAM: Not yet. 
BOTH:  I come home in the middle of the night. My mother says when you gonna live your life right? Oh Mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones. And girls, they want to have fun. Oh girls just want to have fun.  New Instant 
MESSAGE: Stone & Son Suit Warehouse contract expired with their paper provider! Go get it!  David Wallace 
DWIGHT: Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They re a family owned business . Jim and I used to clean up at those. We d go in pretending to be family   brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew. 
DWIGHT:  I hope you ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it s time for another episode of  Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire . 
JIM: Sorry, Stinky, can t do it. Too busy. 
DWIGHT: Oh, god, this again? You re Stinky. 
JIM: Okay. There s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something. 
DWIGHT: Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity. 
PHYLLIS: I have ears, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears.  See what you leave me with here, Jim? 
JIM: Hey, I m in Philadelphia right now. 
DWIGHT: How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour. 
JIM: Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour? 
DWIGHT: Mmm. That s a good  question. 300 times   180  Um that comes to 25 minutes.  Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you. 
NELLIE: Darryl, looking good! 
DARRYL: Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim s company. 
PAM: Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him? 
DARRYL: Why don t you come along and tell him yourself? 
PAM: Ha ha. That d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get  What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn t I think of this? Andy s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that? 
ERIN: Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details. 
PAM: A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything s in order. 
ERIN: What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it s in order? I  haven t been trained for this. 
PAM:  Okay, see you later. 
CLARK: Hey guys. 
PHYLLIS: Clark! 
MEREDITH: Hey! 
OSCAR: Hey, look who s back, Dwight Junior. 
KEVIN: Hey, so how was it? I mean  the sex with Jan. 
CLARK: A gentleman doesn t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved. 
CLARK: Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was  like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh  like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room. 
MEREDITH: Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say,  Talk classy, act nasty . 
CLARK: What s with the wig Meredith? 
MEREDITH: What, is it on backwards?  
CLARK: Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so  bon appetite. 
PHYLLIS: Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that s Italian. 
OSCAR: My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time. 
MEREDITH: Always with the friends Oscar. Can t we just enjoy the new espresso machine? 
OSCAR: Actually, it s pronounced  espresso  Wait. That s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So  
DWIGHT: There he is!  We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but  
CLARK: If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission. 
DWIGHT: Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh  No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that? 
CLARK:  I loved it. 
DWIGHT: How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale? 
CLARK: If it ll lead to me being a salesman, I ll pretend to be your friend. 
DWIGHT: Then looks like we have a deal  Son  
ERIN: Hi guys! 
PETE: Hey, look who it is! 
ERIN: Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose. 
OSCAR: Try this one.  
ERIN: Thank you!  
ERIN: I don t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone s trust. About the pens. 
PAM: You ready for your interview? 
DARRYL: I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy s job in the bag until my interview. 
PAM: Well, you shouldn t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim. 
DARRYL: Yeah, I guess  
PAM: Really, you can t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he s basically Gumby with hair.  Suit Store 
FATHER:  It s kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store. 
DWIGHT: You know, you re right! We hadn t even thought of that, had we boy?  
CLARK: No, we sure hadn t Pop.  
DWIGHT:  Oh! You re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh?  
CLARK: He calls me Clarky  cause he s my Dad. 
DWIGHT: Guilty! Suit Store 
FATHER: You don t meet many hunters these days. 
CLARK: My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he s like a serial killer  of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick!  
DWIGHT: It was his birthday, just turned three. So  Suit Store 
FATHER: Ahh  
OSCAR: You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy? 
NELLIE: No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder? 
KEVIN: Taste test? I m in! 
OSCAR: YOLO!  
PHYLLIS: What?  
OSCAR: It s a thing. It means  you only live once . 
KEVIN: Yeah, we re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it. 
OSCAR: Well  
KEVIN: Alright everybody, who s in?  Angela?  Don t make us come over there. 
ANGELA: No, I don t  no. 
KEVIN: Alright, let s go.  
ANGELA: Can t I just agree without putting my hand in? 
NELLIE: Absolutely not! 
KEVIN: No way. 
ANGELA: Oh, fine.  
KEVIN: Ok guys,  we all drink them all . 
EVERYONE:  We all drink them all! 
KEVIN: Yes! 
OSCAR: Yes! 
NELLIE: Whoo! 
PHYLLIS: Hey, where s my ring? 
CREED: I m sure it ll turn up. Athlead 
EMPLOYEE:  Yes ma am, you want to go east on Franklin, take that all the way to Commonweath. You ll see us on the right side, you can t miss us. 
DENNIS:  And I want to reach every demographic possible. 
JIM: No, I hear what you re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright? 
DENNIS: We re talking weeks here, not months, right? 
JIM: Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago. 
DENNIS: Alright. Good. 
JIM: Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it.  Hey! How are you? 
PAM: Good! 
JIM: What are you doing here? 
PAM: I just wanted to see you! 
JIM: That s so great! 
DARRYL: Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out! 
JIM: It s pretty great, right? I mean, we re coming along   Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis s timeline 
WADE: Okay 
JIM:  Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home. 
DWIGHT:  But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark s getting out of my car. He s a good boy, does whatever I say. Suit Store 
FATHER:  I can t relate to that, my son hates my guts. 
DWIGHT: Oh  really. Suit Store 
FATHER: Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that? 
DWIGHT:  Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they re not even good. Really, they re bad. Like you and your son. 
CLARK:  Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but  God I missed you! 
DWIGHT: What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie? 
CLARK:  I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool. 
DWIGHT: You re being disrespectful! 
CLARK:  And I love you, for saying that. 
DWIGHT:  We don t get along. 
CLARK:  Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is  our relationship is  terr- 
DWIGHT: Terrible! 
CLARK: Terrible. 
DWIGHT: Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius! 
PAM: Wow, this place is  so great. I had no idea   on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky. 
JIM: Well, I mean, I don t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so  These things go down all the time. 
DARRYL: If this company s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it. 
JIM:  Are you cool to just hang out? 
PAM: Sure, no problem. 
JIM: Yeah?  You ready? 
DARRYL: Yeah. 
JIM: Let s do it! 
ERIN: The pen delivery went amazing, and now I ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I m not one of those people who s just like,  Uh, sure. I ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand  they are just sitting here. Pam didn t tell me not to unpack them. Don t want to be a busybody, but I don t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it s insane! I m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I ve never had an espresso before. They re good though. 
NELLIE: A-bam!  My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I ve tried so far is Alpine Select! 
KEVIN: Yes!  
ANGELA: Ugh! 
KEVIN: One!  
ANGELA: Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! 
KEVIN: Two   
ANGELA: Stop it! 
KEVIN: Three  
OSCAR: That s enough Kevin. 
ANGELA: Stop it Kevin! 
KEVIN: Four! 
OSCAR: That s enough! 
ANGELA: Kevin! 
CLARK: So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing. Suit Store 
FATHER: I heard that before  
CLARK: Well, I understand, but   
DWIGHT: I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son. 
CLARK: Here we go again, another lecture from the old man. Suit Store 
FATHER: Listen to him. He created you. 
DWIGHT: Maybe if you listened a little bit, you d improve. No wonder women despise you. 
CLARK: Women don t despise me  
DWIGHT: His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn t see it, or didn t wanna see it. 
CLARK: Alright, that s enough,  cause I can say some things about him too. 
DWIGHT: Yeah? Like what? 
CLARK: Like the time that you got drunk and, and then  Killed those kids on their way to prom! 
DWIGHT: That never happened. He s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught  saving treats  from the kitty litter box. Suit Store 
FATHER: Really shameful  
CLARK: So we can offer you matte or glossy printing- 
DWIGHT: Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers. 
CLARK: There s obviously a volume discount uh, if you- 
DWIGHT: Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going  please kitty, may I have some more?  You can t make this stuff up! 
CLARK: No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends. Suit Store 
SON: Hey fellas, sorry to keep you waiting. Suit Store 
FATHER: Here he is, my son. 
DWIGHT:  Got cat turd collector written all over him. Suit Store 
SON:  Did you say cat turd collector? Athlead 
EMPLOYEE: ...So definitely looking to expand our market, but for now we re just concentrating on athletes that are popular here in the northeast. Of course, that s not a mandate.

JIM: Mm-hm Athlead 
EMPLOYEE: Alright, so what makes you think you d be a good fit here?

EMPLOYEE: So how about we start over, hmm? Darryl, do you have any thoughts on the company?

STANLEY: Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here! 
STANLEY: I usually take a siesta about now. 
PETE:  Stocking pens, huh? You re like the new office administrator. 
ERIN: No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it s the truth, I swear. 
KEVIN: Pam! Pam, look out! Erin s gunning for your job! 
ERIN: No, I m not!  It s not like that at all! Forget it, I m so sorry. 
KEVIN: Pam, look out! 
ERIN: Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you ve had. Athlead 
EMPLOYEE: By the way, Jim talks about you all the time. 
PAM: That s sweet that he talks about me. Athlead 
EMPLOYEE: It s too bad he still hast to work part time in Scranton though  
PAM: Well, that s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia. Athlead 
EMPLOYEE: We can t wait until you move here. Suit Store 
SON: I m sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper? 
DWIGHT: Do you mind? The men are talking. Suit Store 
FATHER: Sons used to idolize their fathers. 
DWIGHT: Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract? Suit Store 
FATHER: I d love to! Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kind of pushed me out, truth be told. I m just here for human contract. Suit Store 
SON: Okay Pop  
DWIGHT: Wait, so you re the boss? Suit Store 
SON: That s right.

DARRYL: Yeah, yeah me too. I think it d be like  You know what?  I think it d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot  Perfecto!  Oh my god  
PAM: They re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don t blame Cece. 
DARRYL: So I m like a three year old girl in this scenario  
PAM: Say they don t hire you. It s not like you re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you. 
DARRYL: And I d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I m  I m not so sure I d like living in Philadelphia. 
PAM: Right? Thank you! It s just Philly. Everyone s acting like it s New York or Paris or London. 
DARRYL: Who needs it? 
PAM: Not us. 
JIM:  Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They re going to make you pay for the fish, and  they wanted to know when you can start. 
DARRYL: What?  How about yesterday? 
PAM: Congratulations. 
DARRYL: Oh, thank you. 
PAM: I guess you gotta move to Philly after all. 
DARRYL: Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die! 
PAM: No, I m not upset. I m really excited for Darryl  Maybe I m a little disappointed that we ll be losing him. 
KEVIN: It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here. 
OSCAR: It s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too! 
ANGELA:  I don t get the point of this stupid window! 
CLARK: I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That s why his face always breaks out. Suit Store 
SON: Does that suit come with a fire extinguisher?  
CLARK: You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I m going to need one right? If I m ever going to get a  real job  and move my  lazy ass  out of your  G.D. house . Suit Store 
SON: He s got you there  Suit Store 
SON:  That s Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful  Although expensive. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, you don t want Italian. You ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you ll be doing life in Rikers Island. 
CLARK: Well, that s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island. 
DWIGHT: That place doesn t exist. It s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much? 
CLARK:  How do I look? 
DWIGHT: Actually  You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I ll take one too. 
OSCAR: Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don t we move the copier into the annex like we ve always wanted to? 
NELLIE: Whoo! 
MEREDITH: Frickin  A! 
OSCAR: Huh? 
KEVIN: So long, noise! 
OSCAR: One, two, three!  
NELLIE: And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we re going to be in so much trouble! 
OSCAR: Wait!  It s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it. 
MEREDITH: Tear up the carpet! 
NELLIE: Whoo! 
DARRYL: Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That s how you do that, baby. It s all good, I m ready. Y all ready for this?  
PAM:  Everybody dance now   
OSCAR: Kevin, move. I can t pull up the rug if you re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet. 
KEVIN: Well I can t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me. 
ANGELA: Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin? 
NELLIE: Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don t you just have some more coffee? 
STANLEY: It s all gone. I didn t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant. 
CREED: I saw the leaves twitch! 
ANGELA: Shut up! 
CREED: You shut up! 
OSCAR: Everybody shut up and work! 
PHYLLIS: We don t work for you! 
KEVIN: Yeah! 
ANGELA: Yeah! 
STANLEY: Hey, it s five o clock.  
OSCAR:  Kevin, can- 
ANGELA: What s going on? 
DWIGHT: Yes! We did it!  
CLARK: You opened the door- 
DWIGHT: And you closed it. The boys are back in town.  High fives! Ha ha! 
CLARK: Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right? 
DWIGHT: You got me!  I used to collect them! 
CLARK: Why? 
DWIGHT: Each one is very different, like a snowflake. 
PAM:  Hey  What happened here? 
ERIN: You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That s what happened. The pens happened. 
PAM:  Are the pens here? 
DWIGHT: Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts.  Scranton Mimeograph Corp?  I don t think we re doing business with them any time soon. That s odd. A letter from Robert Dunder.  A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.  The Holy Grail. 
PAM: : Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail? 
JIM: I think I m a little too busy these days to s---  Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail. 
JIM: The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then. 
KEVIN: I don t get it. 
DWIGHT: Aha! A lightbulb. 
KEVIN: A lightbul-- 
DWIGHT: A lightbulb. Okay. Okay.  Invisible ink. 
KEVIN: Whoa. 
DWIGHT:  Higher than numbers go.  The ceiling above accounting! 
ANGELA: Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight! 
JIM: : Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ... 
JIM: ...and finds the... fake grail? No grail? 
PAM: You don t remember? 
JIM: I don t. 
DWIGHT: An  X.  
OSCAR: Annex. It must open something in the annex. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
KEVIN: Whoa. 
DWIGHT:  Sedes introiti.  Seat of entrance. 
DWIGHT:  
PETE: What? 
OSCAR: What? 
KEVIN: That s a flush. 
ALL:  
ALL: The warehouse. 
PAM:  There s nothing down here. 
JIM: Oh, I expected more from young Halpert. 
DWIGHT: Let s just forget it. Forget it.  
NELLIE: So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative? 
ERIN: Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack. 
NELLIE: Wow. 
ERIN: It s just Pete in sunglasses. 
NELLIE: Oh. 
ERIN: And then we had him  Like  Dunder Mifflin. 
PETE: Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them  Like  Derek s  Likes.  
ERIN: So far, we re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big. 
NELLIE: You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together. 
ERIN: All right. 
ERIN: Pete and I work well together -- not that there s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I m into girls. Not that I m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question? 
JIM: Hey. 
CO-WORKER: Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch. 
JIM: Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later. Co-worker 
#2: Uh sure. No problem. 
JIM: Cece s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I ve been working with her on her move. It s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It s kind of like this. It s pretty cute, right? 
DWIGHT: Pfft,  Athlead ? Please. They re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it  Stumpany,  for  Stupid Company.  
DARRYL: Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That s why I m doing it. 
DWIGHT: You re working for  Stumpany  too? 
DARRYL: Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I m switching over. 
DWIGHT: What? 
DARRYL: Yep. 
DWIGHT:  Hey, Halpert, what s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you re stealing Darryl too. When will it end? 
JIM: Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity. 
DWIGHT: You won t stop until you ve poached us all. 
JIM: Yeah. Even you. 
DWIGHT: No. I ll be damned if I m gonna let us lose me. 
JIM: Bye, Dwight. 
JIM: Hi. How are ya? Good to see you. 
PAM: Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? 
KEVIN: Ooh, I haven t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato? 
PAM: Oh, no, Kevin, it s not a joke. Angela s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind. 
ANGELA: I have no information. But I m sure as soon as they know, they ll call you. 
PAM: Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb? 
PAM: Well, I m heading out to Cece s dance recital. 
OSCAR: Aw. 
PAM: Hey, Cece, Daddy s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited? 
CECE: Yeah. 
PAM: Let s call him.  
JIM: Hey. I was just about to call you. 
PAM: Hey, Hon, are you close? 
JIM: I am still in Philly, actually. 
PAM: What? 
JIM: It s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I m stuck here trying to keep him on board. 
PAM: Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren t gonna make it. 
JIM: Pam, I couldn t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call. 
CECE: I want Daddy. 
JIM: You re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy s gonna record it. So we ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam? 
PAM: Of course. 
JIM: Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone? 
PAM: Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something. 
JIM: Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you re not the best with the phone. 
PAM: I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say,  Bye, Daddy.  
CECE: Bye, Daddy. 
JIM: Bye.  Yep. See, you ve still got to press  End,  Pam. 
CECE: Press  End.  
PETE: Oh, check it out. This is our first real  Like.  
ERIN: Oh, my gosh! 
PETE: Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific. 
ERIN: Wow. That guy s really into paper. 
PETE: Yeah. 
NELLIE: Well done, you two. 
ERIN: We did it. Youth task force forever. 
PETE: Yes. 
PETE:  Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you? 
ERIN: No, you go -- okay. 
PETE: All right, all right.Okay, start over. 
NELLIE: Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man.  Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.  I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie. 
DWIGHT: Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below. 
ALL:  
DWIGHT: You re welcome. 
PHYLLIS: Wait. This says  Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge ? 
DWIGHT: This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want. 
OSCAR:  Loyalty pledge ? 
DARRYL: Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, we ll see about that. 
DWIGHT: Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay?  Infuriating, irresponsible ... 
CLARK: They got us set up with Windows 95, so you re kind of dreaming here. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I m gonna need you to print it out.  
DWIGHT:  Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it s an idea. But what does it mean? 
KEVIN: Ooh, it s when you get a free sandwich after you ve already eaten ten sandwiches. 
DWIGHT: Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client. Mr. 
ROMANKO: I wouldn t say a rage. 
DARRYL: Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It s very unlikely it would happen again. Mr. 
ROMANKO: Thank you. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: No, you re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? L-- 
DARRYL: Loyalty. 
DWIGHT: Loyalty. 
NELLIE: Loyalty is exactly right. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
NELLIE: Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships? 
STANLEY: That s none of your damn business. 
NELLIE: Darryl is  dating  Dunder Mifflin. 
DARRYL: Darryl is dating Val... still. 
NELLIE: But he s flirting with Jim s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to. Mr. 
ROMANKO: I m sorry. Do I still need to be here? 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
NELLIE: I m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let s-- let s use an example. Take Erin. Erin s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
NELLIE: So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example? 
CREED: Let s try it out. 
NELLIE: No, let s-- let s-- let s not say Creed. Let s say Mr. X. 
ANGELA: Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy. 
ERIN: Oh, I m sorry. Didn t you cheat on Andy? 
ANGELA: Yes. And he didn t like it. 
PHYLLIS: Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X? 
KEVIN: Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that s the guy that Erin s flirting with? Dance 
TEACHER: Ladies and gentlemen, the Little Ladybug Ballerinas.  
BALLERINAS: One, two, three.  Parent in 
AUDIENCE: Really? 
PAM: Oh, I m sorry. Sorry. 
BALLERINAS: One, two, three. 
PAM:  Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural?  Oh, my God! 
AUDIENCE: Shh! 
PAM:  Um, I m sorry. I have to go. My daughter s a ladybug. I know that doesn t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you. Parent in audience 
#2: You re very rude. Parent in audience 
#1: Yes, very rude. 
PAM: Shh! Kids are dancing. 
DWIGHT: Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years.  So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself? 
DARRYL: Dwight, look, I m sorry you re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that. 
DWIGHT: It can t be more fun than selling paper and paper products. 
DARRYL: It can. 
DWIGHT: Are you pretending to be crazy, huh? 
PHYLLIS: Well, Andy s cute, but he s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird. 
ERIN: I m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven t done anything. 
MEREDITH: Yeah right. With slammin  bods like that, they ain t playing checkers. 
OSCAR: People, it s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man? 
ERIN: Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that s the end of it. Right, Pete? 
PETE: That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from? 
KEVIN: Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis. 
ALL:  
ERIN: Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force. 
NELLIE: I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah. 
NELLIE: Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You re welcome, Andy. And you re welcome, my own ass. 
INVESTOR: Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me. 
CO-WORKER: Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim? 
JIM: Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--  
JIM: Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he ll be calling in any second. 
PAM:  Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something. 
LONNIE: Hey boss, you gotta jump on a delivery. 
DARRYL: I don t do that anymore. 
LONNIE: That s what they told me. 
DARRYL:  
DARRYL: All right, let s get this over with. 
DWIGHT: You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo!  Here we go! Yeah! 
DWIGHT: Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!  
DARRYL: How far is this place?  
DWIGHT: Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports.  
DARRYL: Fun. 
TOBY: Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there. 
NELLIE: Oh, thank you. I don t know, I sort of thought-- 
TOBY:  So proud of you, Hon. 
NELLIE: Oh, I don t know. Okay. 
TOBY: I m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin? 
NELLIE: Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one. 
TOBY: Pete s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat. 
NELLIE: I didn t really think about it like that. 
TOBY: Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have. 
NELLIE:  What we have ? 
TOBY: Mm-hmm. 
NELLIE: I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Fast food. I ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day. 
DARRYL: They have fast food in Philly. 
DWIGHT: Not like this. 
DARRYL: Exactly like this. Fast Food 
WORKER: And your milkshake. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
DARRYL: It s 30 degrees out. You drinkin  a mildshake? 
DWIGHT: Nope.  Fire in the hole!  Oh, yeah! Now that s what working at a paper company s all about!  
DWIGHT: Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go. 
DARRYL: You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage. 
DWIGHT: It s a youtube thing! Let s go. Let s go. Come on, they re coming. 
PAM: Anyone want to see the video from Cece s recital? 
ANGELA: Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that . 
OSCAR: I ll watch it. Let s get this over with. 
PAM: All right, you don t have to. 
KEVIN: Let s get this over with, Pam. 
PAM: Okay.  
OSCAR: Oh. 
PAM: Wait. What? 
PAM:  Excuse me, I have to get back to work. 
PAM: Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off. 
OSCAR: User error. I ve heard of that happening to other people. 
ANGELA: Oscar, don t rub it in. I m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child. 
PAM: Well, it was an important phone call. 
PAM: I haven t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he s always like,  Beesly!  I love that. Only thing better than getting the job--  Beesly!   
PETE: Hey. 
ERIN: Hello, Peter. 
DWIGHT:  It barely even feels like a prank anymore. 
DARRYL: You missed a spot. Drive Thru 
CUSTOMER: Fire in the hole!  Go! Go! Go! Go!  
DWIGHT: Ha ha! Yeah, joke s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up! 
NELLIE: I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force. 
ERIN: Oh, no, I really don t think that s a good idea. 
NELLIE: Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it. 
PETE: Well, okay, then. 
ERIN: I guess we don t have a choice. 
NELLIE: Nope. 
PETE: yeah. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
TOBY: Lady...you never stop surprising me. 
DWIGHT:  
DARRYL:  
DWIGHT: What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee? 
DARRYL: No. I was clearing my throat. 
MEREDITH: Good night. 
PAM: Night 
CREED: Night 
PAM: Night, Creed.  
PAM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
PAM: So, how s it going? 
JIM: We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It s like everything I did, he just wouldn t go for it. 
PAM: I m so sorry. 
JIM: I have no idea where we re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks. 
PAM:  Oh, I m sorry. I feel like you ve already been working insanely hard. 
JIM: Can you figure out how to upload Cece s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up. 
PAM: Um, actually, funny story -- I didn t get it. I shouldn t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all. 
JIM: You re not serious, are you? You didn t get any of the recital? 
PAM: No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part. 
JIM: Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how. 
PAM: Yeah, okay, I m sorry. I m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it. 
JIM: Oh, great. So we ll see somebody else s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it s really not that hard to film a video. 
PAM: Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit? 
JIM: Look, Pam, I don t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It s gone. That moment s just gone. I missed it. 
PAM: I don t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there. 
JIM: You re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You ve agreed to this. 
PAM: You know what? I-- I-- I don t think you want to start a conversation with me about what s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever -- 
JIM: Pam, I m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I m not going over this again. 
CO-WORKER: Jim. We need you. 
JIM: I don t know how else to tell you, okay? I m doing everything I can every week to bring home something... 
PAM: I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want. 
JIM: I m doing this just for me? Is that what I m doing? I m doing it just for me. If that s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay? 
PAM: Yep. 
JIM: We ll talk tomorrow? 
PAM: Yep. I ll talk to you tomorrow. 
JIM: Okay. I ll talk to you tomorrow. 
PAM: Bye.  
BRIAN: Hey, you okay? 
PAM: What am I doing wrong, Brian? 
BRIAN: Nothing. You re doing the best you can. 
CAMERAMAN: Brian. 
BRIAN: Give her a minute. Give her a minute. 
PAM:  
BRIAN: Hey, it s just a tough situation, all right? 
PAM: It s getting tougher. I just didn t know that it was gonna be this hard. 
BRIAN: Yeah. Let s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough. 
PAM: Thank you. 
GUY:  Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
DARRYL:  
GUY:  I nailed that guy, dude. Oh yeah. 
DARRYL: And replay. 
GUY:  Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! I nailed that guy, dude. Oh, yeah. 
DARRYL:  I m gonna miss the paper business. 
PAM: Hey Brian, you got a sec? 
BRIAN: Yeah, hold on a sec. 
PAM: I feel awful. 
BRIAN: It s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you.  
ERIN:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. 
PAM: Well, thanks for being a good friend. 
BRIAN: Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away? 
PAM: Yeah, mostly. 
ERIN: Pam, phone call. 
PAM: Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa. 
BRIAN: Will do. 
PAM: Okay. Thank you. 
BRIAN: Sure. 
MEREDITH: Hey, boom guy. 
BRIAN: Oh, hey Meredith. 
MEREDITH: When are you gonna boom me? 
BRIAN: Uh, listen, they re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna  I, I ll see you later. 
MEREDITH: Got it. 
CLARK: Hey, so I hear you re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job? 
DWIGHT: That s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride. 
CLARK: Well, uh  see, you raised it. 
DWIGHT: Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did. 
DWIGHT: Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim s desk while he s away in Philly. Finally I ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It s like,  Really, Jim? You don t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.  Wow. 
CLARK: You know what, man? I deserve this job. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hmm. 
CLARK: I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond  and under. 
DWIGHT: You know what? You re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance. 
DWIGHT: Clark has no chance. I mean, he s up against my buddy Rolf, for God s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor   he ll make you laugh so hard, you ll puke your pants. 
CLARK: This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome. 
DWIGHT: Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam. 
JIM: You could ve just called that an alliance too, right? 
DWIGHT: I chose my words very carefully. 
JIM: Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that s only gonna make things worse. 
CLARK:  You interviewing for the sales job too? 
ROLF: No. You re interviewing for it. I m getting it. 
CLARK: Well, I wouldn t be so sure about that. I mean, I ve been working here 12 weeks. That s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we ve seen. 
ROLF: I m Rolf. Rolf Ahl. 
CLARK: Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl. 
ROLF: Go to hell. 
CLARK: There he is. 
DWIGHT: Hey. Come on, buddy. Let s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don t compare. When you re with the R-O-L-F, you re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor.  
ROLF: Nice. 
DWIGHT: Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy. 
PAM: When are you talking to David Wallace? 
JIM: I m talking to him this afternoon, but don t get your hopes up. 
PAM: Too late. My hopes are up. 
JIM: Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix   me asking the boss of the company I m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So  problem solved. Thanks, guys. 
DWIGHT: And this chair s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha! 
JIM: I m on the phone. I m on the phone. 
DWIGHT: No doy! 
JIM: I m just gonna call you back. Thanks.  
ROLF: I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don t do earbuds. 
DWIGHT:  No earbuds!  
JIM: I m sure he s just nervous. 
PAM:  It s fine. It s just a seating arrangement. Doesn t matter. 
DWIGHT: So I ve got your resume here, but it s not telling me everything. 
ROLF: Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you re qualified to evaluate me? 
DWIGHT: Well, I m the one offering the job. 
ROLF: What are your credentials? 
DWIGHT: I ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I m an Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
ROLF: I think I ve heard everything I need to hear. 
DWIGHT: Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I m sure he d give a reference. 
ROLF: Thank you, Dwight. I ll be in touch. 
DWIGHT: Well, they can t all be winners. But Trevor s next and he s a real professional. You say,  Jump,  and he says,  Oh who?  He loves to jump on people, that Trevor. 
DWIGHT: What makes you think you d be an effective paper salesman? 
TREVOR: Ooh, okay. Didn t see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it. 
DWIGHT: Well, it s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman. 
TREVOR: Pass. Next one. 
DWIGHT: All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter? 
TREVOR: No, no and no. 
DWIGHT: There were only two options. 
TREVOR: Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking? 
DWIGHT: This is a bus transfer. 
TREVOR:  Nothing gets by this guy. 
CLARK: Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview? 
JIM: Sure, yeah, go ahead. 
CLARK: Thanks, dude. You you sure it s okay?  Cause you re kinda  
JIM: Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You re clean, right? 
CLARK: Oh, Dove Men. 
JIM: Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don t listen to it at all because we re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so  
CLARK: Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this? 
JIM: Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do. 
CLARK: Thanks, dude. 
JIM: Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face. 
CLARK: Why? 
JIM: I need you to breathe in my face right now. 
CLARK:  
JIM: What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen? 
CLARK: Wintergreen. 
JIM: I knew it, I knew it. 
CLARK: Yeah, good nose. 
JIM: I looked at you coming around, and I said,  Wintergreen.  
DWIGHT: I can t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly. 
DWIGHT: Okay, here s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party. 
CLARK: That s just a classic no-win situation. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
CLARK: So I d Kobayashi Maru it. 
DWIGHT: Damn it! Perfect answer, again. 
CLARK: Yep. 
DWIGHT: Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond   
CLARK: You know what, Dwight? 
DWIGHT: And anoth  
CLARK: This interview s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru d the whole process. 
DWIGHT: No. 
CLARK: Yeah. Star Trek rules. 
DWIGHT: It does, but still no. 
CLARK: Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that? 
DWIGHT: Oh, you think they re my only friends? I ve got way more friends than that, and they re all better than the losers who work here.  
STANLEY: This is not natural. 
OSCAR: Just   I don t wanna make assumptions based on people s physical appearances. 
PAM: Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell? 
DARRYL: They smell so bad. 
MEREDITH: If I ever get that bad, you d tell me, right? 
KEVIN: Meredith, I tell you all the time. 
MEREDITH:  Walked right into that one. 
DWIGHT: Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I ve got big expectations, Mose-wise. 
DWIGHT: What quality would make you a good sales associate? 
MOSE: People person. 
DWIGHT: It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical. 
MOSE: That s right. 
DWIGHT: You know we live together, right? 
MOSE: Yes. 
DWIGHT: And I ve never seen you go to work, ever. 
MOSE: Okay. 
DWIGHT: So why is this on your resume?  
CLARK: So how d you guys hear about the position? 
GABOR: My my mom. 
NATE: Dwight called my house, but he didn t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can t stay out of her stuff. 
ZEKE: Dwight s my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower. 
CLARK: You were in the shower or he was in the shower? 
ZEKE: Everyone was in the shower. It s a cow shower, so there s like, a ton of people in there. 
CLARK: So you guys all know Dwight already? 
MELVINA: I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby. 
GABOR: I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school. 
MELVINA: You went to X-Men school too?  
CLARK: X-Men school? 
DWIGHT: When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out. 
GABOR: Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi s. A lot of telemarketing. 
ANGELA: I don t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something. 
STANLEY: I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn t work then. And now look what he s doing to us. 
NELLIE: Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault. 
JIM: How is it my fault? 
NELLIE: Here s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others. 
JIM: But it s Dwight who s bring in all the weirdos. 
OSCAR: Yeah, but Jim, Dwight s a weirdo. We can t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos. 
PAM: Hey, I m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim s away. I m in a position where I m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong.  Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off. David 
WALLACE:  Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later. 
JIM: Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input  
DWIGHT:  This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don t lie. I can tell if you re lying. David 
WALLACE: Hey, Dwight. It s David. 
DWIGHT: David. David 
WALLACE: Jim says he d like some say in the hiring process. 
DWIGHT: Really? That s interesting.  Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately. 
JIM: I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife  David 
WALLACE: Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work. 
JIM: Oh. Um  David 
WALLACE: Yeah. 
JIM: Okay. I can t say that that s not fair. 
DWIGHT: Sounds fair to me, David. David 
WALLACE: And I know we have a call scheduled for later   
JIM: Oh, yeah, so we ll just do that later. 
DWIGHT: No. Why not do it now? David 
WALLACE: Yeah. What s up Jim? 
JIM: Uh   Well, it s about Athlead. I m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call? 
DWIGHT: I d love to be in the loop, David. David 
WALLACE: It s okay. Go ahead, Jim. 
JIM: There s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor   David 
WALLACE: Okay. Jim, I m gonna have to stop you right there. 
JIM: Yes, okay. Bye. 
DWIGHT:  I d love to invest. 
JIM: No, thanks. 
DWIGHT: I d like to give you $100 million.   
HIDE: Why you make trees into bushes? You don t make paper from bushes. 
PAM: Hide, they re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don t you go up and get one? 
HIDE: Thank you. 
PAM: Yeah.  
TROY: Whoops. 
ZEKE:  It s dense. Like bread. 
JIM: Dwight, you can t just hire someone  cause they re your friend. 
DWIGHT: I m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend. 
NELLIE: They re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks. 
DWIGHT: You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero. 
DARRYL: Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating. 
WOLF: Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch. 
DWIGHT: Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch. 
DWIGHT: Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of  em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof. 
DWIGHT: Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this. 
WOLF: Do you want this paper? 
DWIGHT: I sure do. 
WOLF: It s not very good. 
DWIGHT: I will pay you whatever it takes. 
WOLF: I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad. 
DWIGHT: No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money. 
WOLF: Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It s over. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You re still at the 570 number? 
WOLF: I am. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Good, good, good.  
HIDE: I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University. 
DWIGHT: This isn t gonna work out. 
HIDE: Thank you.  
DWIGHT: Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I m hesitant. Why can t I pull the trigger on any of them? 
DWIGHT:  No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them.  
MELVINA: Do you need to be changed? 
DWIGHT: I do that myself now. 
MELVINA: Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I ve been double-parked for five hours. I m wondering if I should move my car. 
DWIGHT: No, you ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes. 
MELVINA: Well, the joke s on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas. 
TREVOR: Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, we re still gonna be your friend. 
WOLF: Yeah, whether it s me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina  
DWIGHT: Or none of you  
WOLF: Yeah, you d bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us. 
TREVOR: Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you. 
DWIGHT: I wish I could hire all of you. 
ZEKE: I could start Monday. 
DWIGHT: Psst. Jim Jim?  Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. 
JIM: Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I m not looking south, I m not livin . That s what I always say. 
DWIGHT: Just act natural.  
DWIGHT: And I was thinking it s only fair that you help make this decision since they ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife. 
JIM: But you know I wouldn t hire any of these all-stars. 
DWIGHT: Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it s your call. 
JIM: Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor? 
DWIGHT: I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn t picture any of them in the old gold and gray. 
JIM: I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin. 
DWIGHT: Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal. 
JIM: Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You? 
DWIGHT: Yes. Thank you. Amazed. 
JIM: And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you. Sensei 
IRA: I m sorry? 
DWIGHT: What? This is such bullcrap! 
JIM: Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say. 
DWIGHT: Wow. So much crap. It s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them? 
JIM: Too much now. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
NATE: Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep. 
DWIGHT: Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever. 
JIM: That seems inconsiderate. 
ROLF: No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don t open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe. 
DWIGHT: Guys, it wasn t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor. 
TREVOR: Well, my day s shot. 
ROLF: Yeah, it s that weird hour where it s too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swanson s. 
WOLF: I got it. Paintball. 
DWIGHT: Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work? 
TREVOR:  And what are we supposed to do until then? 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
WOLF: Let s just go, you guys. 
ROLF: Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right? 
JIM: All right. I think that went well. 
JIM: So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that ll print out Hey. Meet your new desk mate. 
CLARK: What s up good lookin ? 
PAM: Oh, cool. Hey Clark. 
JIM: Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering. 
PAM: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate. 
JIM: Okay. I m really sorry I told the guys I d be there for the board meeting. 
PAM: Of course. 
JIM: I ll call you when I get there. 
PAM: Okay. 
JIM: All right. 
PAM: Bye. 
JIM: Take care of my wife. I will be back. 
DWIGHT: They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours. 
CLARK: Hey, Pam, I m going to the kitchen. You want anything? 
PAM: I m good. 
DWIGHT: Oh, hey, I ll take a coffee. 
CLARK: Oh, I m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee. 
DWIGHT:  
PAM: Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy? 
DWIGHT: Who, me? 
PAM: Us. 
DWIGHT: Absolutely, I do.  
PAM: Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I ll distract him, you take that. 
DWIGHT: Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that s great. 
PAM:  Pam & 
DWIGHT:  
DWIGHT: Aah! 
CLARK: No! 
DWIGHT: Welcome to the club, pig!  
PAM: No, Dwight! 
DWIGHT: Aah! 
JIM: No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does. 
NELLIE: Have you seen Darryl? 
ERIN: He's around here somewhere. 
NELLIE: Mmm.  
ERIN: Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday.  Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies. 
ERIN: Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun. 
ERIN:  Darryl. Meet... bear... ull. 
DARRYL: How much did you pay for that? 
ERIN: Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe. 
DARRYL: Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it. 
ERIN:  Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much!  That guy's hilarious. He's here today.  
PAM: I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together...  Oh my god!  Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts?  Huh? No way. No way! 
ANGELA: Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house. 
ERIN: Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids. 
ANGELA: No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors. 
KEVIN: Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping...  8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation... 
ANGELA: No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about. 
OSCAR:  Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too. 
ANGELA: What? 
OSCAR: He said he wanted me there for support. 
ANGELA: I'm his! His... wife. 
OSCAR: Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today.  Me. 
ANGELA:  We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too. 
JIM:  Hey. 
DARRYL: Hey. 
JIM: We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly. 
DARRYL: Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates. 
JIM: And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down. 
DARRYL: Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom. 
JIM: I'm couching it! 
DARRYL: Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room. 
JIM: And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this? 
DARRYL: I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to  soak... He hooked me up with a job. 
PAM:  Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand.  Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want?  Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice. 
PAM: I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here.  I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian. 
JIM: Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients. 
DARRYL: Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first. 
JIM:  Who is this guy? We are killing it. 
DARRYL: Yes sir.  
JIM: Yeah! 
PAM:  Conference room. Everybody. Now! 
DWIGHT: You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting. 
PAM: Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting. 
DWIGHT: You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting? 
PAM: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now! 
PAM:  I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it. 
ERIN: I thought that's what you were doing. 
PAM: Yeah, but this is different. 
ERIN: Oh. They used worse paint than your paint? 
PAM: I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So... 
ERIN: I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing. 
PAM: Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped. 
MEREDITH: Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83. 
CREED: Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage. 
OSCAR: Pam, what can be done? 
PAM: Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question. 
OSCAR: I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear. 
PAM: What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing. 
PHYLLIS: David Wallace called this meeting? 
PAM: Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art. 
PAM:  No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go. 
DWIGHT: Pam, I'll help you. 
PAM: You will? 
DWIGHT: If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime. 
PAM: Thank you. 
NELLIE: I am in too, Pam. 
PAM: Yeah? 
NELLIE: Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored. 
PAM: Great. 
PAM: I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car. 
DWIGHT:  You need my pitchfork? 
ANGELA:  Hey! 
DWIGHT: What is it? I have vengeance to exact. 
ANGELA: Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you. 
DWIGHT: Ah, I'm not interested. 
ANGELA: What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people. 
DWIGHT: If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics.  
KEVIN: Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you? 
ANGELA: No. 
KEVIN: OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money. 
ANGELA: Aw, crap. 
DWIGHT:  I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own. 
FRANK: You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there.  
DWIGHT: Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts. 
GLENN: I'm not drawing a butt. 
NELLIE: All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps. 
VAL: OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go. 
DWIGHT: Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts... 
NELLIE: Well, this is getting us nowhere. 
PAM: We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group.  Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him. 
DWIGHT: We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him.  Nate. Your mother is dying.  
PAM: See, I feel bad about that. 
DWIGHT: It's all right. It's all right. 
NATE: So, she's gonna pull through again?  That's great. Can I talk to her? 
DWIGHT: No. She needs her rest again. 
NELLIE: Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business. 
DWIGHT: You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum. 
NATE: Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt... 
PAM:  Tell us who defaced the mural! 
NATE:  He did it. 
PAM: All right. You can go. Give him his gum. 
DWIGHT: There's no gum. There never was any gum. 
NATE:  That's really rude. 
KEVIN:  Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck. 
OSCAR:  That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying? Party 
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Senator and Angela Lipton.  
SENATOR: Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular. 
ANGELA:  Oh, Robert, you're horrible.  Simon, Maxine.  Who let you guys in here? Athlead 
EMPLOYEE:  This is the team. 
JIM: Nice job, man. 
DARRYL: You too... Darryl. 
JIM:  What?  Oh, man! I'm sorry about that. 
DARRYL: It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes. 
JIM: Oh, um... Are you really mad about this? 
DARRYL: That's my go-to thermos. That's all. 
JIM: Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that. 
DARRYL: No big deal. No big deal. 
JIM: No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal. 
DARRYL: Nah, nah... 
JIM: No big deal. 
DARRYL:  Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that. 
JIM: Honestly, I don't mind.  Did you want me to wash it for you or... 
DARRYL: I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak? 
JIM:  OK. Here ya go.  
DARRYL: Thank you. 
NELLIE: So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you? 
PAM:  Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling.  Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn. 
TOBY:  You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank? 
FRANK: I'm sorry I didn't like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny. 
PAM: Well, I didn't think that butt was funny. 
FRANK: Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours. 
PAM: What was that? 
FRANK: You know what? You people can't fire me. So, screw you.  
PAM: Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that? 
TOBY: Uh... it... compliment... 
NELLIE: The first 'sorry' sounded sincere. 
TOBY: There were two or three 'sorry's in there.  
PAM: That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy. 
DWIGHT: Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first. 
PAM: We should just take him down. 
DWIGHT: Wait. Are you saying... 
PAM: I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face. 
DWIGHT: Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt. 
DWIGHT: He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him. 
PAM: Yes! 
DWIGHT: A little eye for an eye action. 
PAM: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Go all Hammurabi on this clown. 
PAM: We need an infiltrator. 
DWIGHT: I know just the man for the job.  
PAM: Clark? 
DWIGHT: He even looks like a mole. 
OSCAR: One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population. Party 
GUEST: You two seem very close. 
SENATOR: Yes. We're good friends. Good friends. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
SENATOR: You know, I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers. For a long time, our party has turned it's back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am.  I am a friend of the Latino community. And if you ask me, it's time we bid bigotry hasta luego.  Now, does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends? I don't know. And I don't care. What I care about is Oscar.  My friend. Mi amigo. Oscar.  
OSCAR: Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me. Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian. 
DARRYL: Oh, hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
DARRYL: I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool? 
JIM: Yeah. Totally. 
DARRYL: All right. 
JIM:  It's mine. Don't worry. 
DARRYL: I didn't say anything. 
JIM: I don't think you had to. 
DARRYL: Excuse me? 
JIM: I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that? 
DARRYL: What you need flour for, Jim? 
JIM: That's not the point. 
DARRYL: What? You making bread? 
JIM: No, I'm not making bread. 
DARRYL: What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel? 
JIM: Darryl, it doesn t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make. 
DARRYL: All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all. 
JIM: It's all good. Are we all good? 
DARRYL: We good. 
JIM: What's that cooler? 
DARRYL: Nothing.  It's mine.   What happened to my Tavis Smileys? 
JIM: Oh, crap. Were those yours? 
DWIGHT:  I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me? 
CLARK: Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys. 
DWIGHT: Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work. 
CLARK: OK, boss.  Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this. 
PAM: Shh, shh. 
CLARK: This is never gonna work. 
PAM: Shh. Remember your lines. 
CLARK: What lines? 
DWIGHT: Go move some paper! 
PAM:  Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse? 
DARRYL: He's not my hire, but I know who he is. 
PAM: OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or... 
DARRYL: What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something? 
PAM: Yeah, something like that. 
DARRYL: I know he loves his pick up truck. 
PAM: Oh, great!  His truck! 
DWIGHT: Great. Get the plate number. 
PAM: OK.  Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that? 
DWIGHT: So we know which truck to van... 
DARRYL: Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that? 
PAM: Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye.  Come on.  Party 
PHOTOGRAPHER: Hold on a second. Uh, Sandeep? Let's get you closer to the senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar? I'm gonna need you to step a little closer to the senator, as well. Somewhere there. 
ANGELA: He's blocking me. 
SENATOR: It's only a photo, honey. Party 
PHOTOGRAPHER:  Excuse me, uh, what's your name? Party 
WAITER: Sean. Party 
PHOTOGRAPHER: LaShawn. Great. You wanna be in a photo? Right this way.  Not you. No. 
OSCAR: He put me here. 
ANGELA: He put you right in front of me? Party 
PHOTOGRAPHER: Let's just wheel Margaret right in front... 
OSCAR: Ow! Robert?! 
SENATOR: Angela. Party 
PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile.  
PAM: I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural? 
DWIGHT: Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita. 
PAM: Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet. 
DWIGHT: Let's see yours. 
PAM: Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid. 
DWIGHT: This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops? 
PAM: Yeah. And he has saggy boobs. 
DWIGHT: I saw that. That's great! 
PAM: Yeah. I feel better. 
DWIGHT: Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch. 
PAM: I know. You miss Angela, don't you? 
DWIGHT: Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis. 
PAM: I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very... 
FRANK:  Lady! My truck? You had no right! Pam:No, you had no right! 
FRANK: It's a $40,000 truck! 
PAM: So? You started it! 
FRANK: So? So someone need to shut you up!  
BRIAN: Hey, hey, hey!  
PAM: Whoa. 
BRIAN:  Easy!  
FRANK: You son of a bitch! 
BRIAN: You're gonna hit a woman? 
SENATOR: Thanks so much for coming. Thanks so much.  Well. Have we all calmed down yet? 
OSCAR: Yes. Sorry about that. 
ANGELA: It was all my fault. 
SENATOR: Let's all try to do better next time. Kevin, great to see you. 
KEVIN: Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck. 
SENATOR: I beg your pardon. 
KEVIN: You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good.  
PAM: Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers. 
BRIAN: No. No, it's... 
PAM: You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me. 
BRIAN: It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that. 
PAM: Forget about my mural. It's stupid. 
BRIAN: No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too. 
PAM: It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry. 
BRIAN: Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you. 
PAM: Thanks, Brian. 
BRIAN: Seeya. 
JIM: Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'. 
DARRYL:  Oh. Come on! 
JIM: Oh. Oh! 
DARRYL: Damn! 
JIM:  You win.  How good did that feel? 
DARRYL: That felt really good, actually. 
PAM:  Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day. 
JIM: It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday. 
PAM:  Alakazam! 
JIM: By the way, they do need an extra day next week. 
PAM: And, poof! He disappears.  
ERIN:  Hey! Wanna play hookey today? 
PETE: Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind? 
ERIN: We can do anything you want. 
ERIN: I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend. 
PETE: Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved. 
ERIN:  Wanna play catch in the parking lot? 
PETE:  Sure. 
ERIN: Great. 
PETE: I'll get my coat. 
ERIN: Perfect.  
DWIGHT:  Come in. 
DWIGHT:  Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract. 
DWIGHT:  I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo. 
DWIGHT: I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow.  Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown. 
KEVIN: Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk. 
KEVIN: OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip. 
NELLIE: I say we all have one last fun boss-less day. 
MEREDITH: Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences. 
PHYLLIS: Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your  boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness. 
STANLEY: Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic. 
PHYLLIS: Oh... 
ANGELA: They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed.  They use a watch repair kit. 
KEVIN:  Ew! I'll be your foot buddy. 
NELLIE: Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount. 
CLARK: It's what I do.  
OSCAR: Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the... 
DARRYL: No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that. 
OSCAR: All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my... 
DARRYL:  Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it. 
PAM:  These are gross. 
JIM: They are terrible. 
PAM: Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill. 
JIM: Oh my god. That's so romantic. 
PAM: It's with Brian and Alyssa. 
JIM: Oh my god. That's less romantic. 
PAM: I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life. 
JIM: Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate? 
PAM: That sounds nice. 
JIM: I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy. Nail stylist 
1: Oh, tiny, poor lady is back. Oh, get the baby clipper.  Nail stylist 
2:  You take off your glasses. 
CLARK: 'Kay.  
NELLIE:  What? Nail stylist 
2: Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl. 
NELLIE: My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra.  
CLARK: Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount.  Excuse me.  Full price. We're not together. 
NELLIE: Oh, come on! 
CLARK: She's living a lie. 
NELLIE: Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship. 
OSCAR:  Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages. Nail 
MANAGER: No. No discount for two men. Two men are not a couple. 
OSCAR: We are together. Romantically. Nail 
MANAGER: Two men?   Doesn't work. No discount. 
DARRYL: Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere.  
JIM:  Hey, Brian. 
BRIAN: Hey. 
PAM: Sorry we're late. 
BRIAN: Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread. 
PAM: Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK. 
JIM: What? 
PAM: He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly. 
JIM: Oh. 
BRIAN: It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming. 
PAM: Yeah. 
JIM: Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy. 
BRIAN: It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available. 
PAM: Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him. 
BRIAN: That's... OK, great. Does he pay well? 
PAM: Where's Alyssa? 
BRIAN: Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today. 
PAM: Oh. 
BRIAN: Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up. 
DWIGHT:  I have yet another sales order for you to sign. 
DWIGHT:  Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo. 
ANDY:  Hi Dwight. 
DWIGHT: You're back.  And you're disgusting. 
PHYLLIS:  Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours. 
ANDY: Well, well, well, look who it is. 
PHYLLIS: Andy. 
ANDY: I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived. 
ERIN: Andy! 
ANDY: Hey! Sweetheart!  I have missed you so much. 
ERIN:  Yes.  Welcome back, buddy. 
ANDY:  I have been dreaming of this moment. 
ERIN: Me too. So much. I'm so happy. 
ERIN: I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something. 
OSCAR: What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow. 
ANDY: Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something.  Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this.  Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe.  
DWIGHT: Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour. 
ANDY: Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart.  But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting. 
CLARK: Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months? 
DWIGHT: No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months.  Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months? 
ANDY: I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe. 
ERIN: He only emailed me four times. 
ANDY: Question. Where's Jim? 
PHYLLIS: He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch. 
ANDY: For two hours? Really? 
OSCAR: So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work? 
ANDY: If the shoe fits.  
BRIAN: We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb. 
JIM: Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight. 
BRIAN: Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over.  I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK.  We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other. 
PAM:  Yeah. 
JIM: What? 
BRIAN: At least my crying won't get you fired. 
JIM: Crying? 
ANDY: I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
ANDY: And you sold it to Jan too. 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
ANDY: I mean... I'm impressed. 
DWIGHT:  Yeah! 
ANDY: Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: You were on a boat. 
ANDY: I was... 
DWIGHT: On a boat. Andy:That... 
DWIGHT: In the ocean. 
ANDY: OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio?  Just say the word 'coolio'. 
DWIGHT: I'm not gonna say it. 
ANDY: Say it. 
DWIGHT: Not a word. 
ANDY: Coolio. 
DWIGHT: No!  What do you think you're doing? 
ANDY: Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up. 
DWIGHT: Don't you dare! Andy! 
JAN:  Hello? 
ANDY: Hey, Jan. Nard dog here. 
JAN: Oh, Andy. 
ANDY: I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup. 
JAN: Really? 
ANDY: Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to. 
JAN: Hmm. 
DWIGHT:  Coolio. 
JAN: Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing? 
DWIGHT: Coolio. Coolio. 
ANDY: No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood. 
JAN: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Coolio. 
ANDY: It, it's, it's actually just an issue... 
JAN: You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option. 
DWIGHT: No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything. 
ANDY: Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but... 
JAN: Tell Angela to send me a final invoice. 
ANDY: Well, ah, ah... 
DWIGHT: Please Ja, Ja...  
ANDY: Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go. 
ANDY:  Hey, everybody, great job.  Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks. 
ANGELA: Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays.  
ANDY: All right. Thank you very much.  Looking good.  Who's that little fella? 
ANGELA: It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter. 
ANDY: Wow, that's wonderful! 
OSCAR: A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone. 
ANDY: Uh-huh. 
ANGELA: Uh-huh. 
ANDY: Uh-huh...  Uh-huh.  Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed. 
DWIGHT: Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen. 
CLARK:  Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week. 
KEVIN: He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right? 
DWIGHT: God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months. 
DWIGHT: I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf. 
NELLIE: I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you? 
MEREDITH: Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover? 
ERIN: Hey! 
PETE: Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her? 
ERIN: Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands. 
DWIGHT: Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway. 
ANDY:  What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on.  Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy!  All right. Back to work. 
PAM: OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why? 
JIM: I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy. 
PAM: I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress. 
JIM: Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you. 
PAM: It's not Brian's fault. 
JIM: No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it. 
PAM: OK. 
ANDY: I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip. 
DWIGHT: Well, we had the Scranton White Pages. 
ANDY: Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK? David 
WALLACE:  Hey guys. 
ANDY: Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do. David 
WALLACE: Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers. 
ANDY: Thank you. David 
WALLACE: Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes? 
ANDY: Great! David 
WALLACE:  Great job, everybody! 
ANDY:  We had to let a warehouse guy go?! 
KEVIN: You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank... 
DWIGHT:    lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy. 
ANDY: What?! 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
ANDY: There was a fire in the warehouse? 
DWIGHT: The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers. 
KEVIN: Whoa. 
ANDY: This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else? 
PHYLLIS: We started selling balloons. 
ANDY: What?! 
CLARK: Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin. 
ANDY: No kidding? 
CLARK: Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless. 
ANDY: Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50. 
CLARK: They're tasteful. 
ANDY: Good, good. What else? 
ANDY: Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire. David 
WALLACE: What fire? 
ANDY: The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes. David 
WALLACE: It looked fine to me. 
ANDY:  I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire. David 
WALLACE: OK. 
ANDY: I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well. David 
WALLACE:  Thanks, Andy. 
ANDY: Thank you. David 
WALLACE: All right. Everyone!  
ERIN:  Fish sounds great. 
ANDY: Yeah, I guess. 
ERIN: Really playing the scales, huh? 
ANDY: Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish? 
ERIN: I don't love you anymore. 
ANDY: What? 
ERIN: I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you. 
ANDY: OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here. 
ERIN: I just said there isn't love. 
ANDY: On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time. 
ERIN: I guess. 
ANDY: I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun. 
ERIN: You got really sunburned. 
ANDY: I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years. 
ERIN: Ugh. 
ANDY: I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again. 
ERIN: You really think we can get that back? 
ANDY: Yes.  Come on. Totally. 
JIM: You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight. 
PAM: Oh? 
JIM: Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station? 
PAM: Are you sure? 
JIM: I just feel like we're gonna fight. 
PAM:  Yeah. 
JIM: So... how 'bout let's not? 
PAM: OK.  
JIM: Oh, um.  Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it. 
PAM:  Wow. I didn't know you kept this. 
JIM: Yeah, yeah. 
PAM: Thank you. 
JIM: No problem. 
PAM: I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight. 
JIM: You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day? 
PAM: Yeah, I do. 
JIM: OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly. 
ERIN: Hi. 
PETE: Hey, you OK? 
ERIN: I couldn't do it. 
PETE: Oh. 
ERIN: I'm sorry. 
PETE: Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK?  
ERIN:  We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months. David 
WALLACE:  Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months? David 
WALLACE: ...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat! 
ANDY: I resent that. I, I never lied to you. 
DAVID: Really?   Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.  
ANDY: And all was good in Scranton PA that day. 
DAVID:  By the way, Oscar says 'hi'  
ANDY: Oscar says  hi  all the time. He says all kinds of greetings.  Hi   Hello   Hola  You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say  hi ? 
DAVID: Andy. 
ANDY: But you're calling me a liar. 
DAVID: Andy! 
ANDY: By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately. 
DAVID: Watch it Andy! 
ANDY: Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013.   Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.  Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED! 
DAVID: My wife? 
ANDY: This has been a really tough time. 
DAVID: Yeah? 
ANDY: Yeah. 
DAVID: Has it? 
ANDY: Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard. 
DAVID: Shh. 
ANDY: It was like a security blan- 
DAVID: Andy. 
ANDY: -ket 
DAVID: Shh. I'm not gonna fire you. 
ANDY: You're not? 
DAVID: No. 
ANDY: That's awesome. 
DAVID: I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that. 
ANDY: David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it. 
DAVID: We are even...now. Understand? Got it? 
ANDY: Crystal. 
DAVID: You are on very- Hey, very thin ice. 
ANDY: Vanilla.  Vanilla Ice. It was a band. 
ANDY: Good morning. 
ERIN: Good morning. 
ANDY: And how are you on this fine-  
ANDY:  Ok, we ready?  Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up. 
ANDY:  Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh 
PAM: He sounds like a wounded animal. 
STANLEY: Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her. 
PHYLLIS: I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad. 
STANLEY: I'm the same way with horny people. 
PAM: Ok.  
ERIN: Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick. 
PAM:  Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you. 
PAM: Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is.  I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note. 
DWIGHT:  No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do. 
DWIGHT:  I need you. 
ANGELA: Ahh! Dwight! 
DWIGHT: And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes. 
ANGELA: What? What is it? 
DWIGHT: It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs. 
ANGELA: Dwight, that's awful. 
DWIGHT: You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was  poisoned  by Aunt Shirley. 
ANGELA: What do you mean by  poisoned ? 
DWIGHT: Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was. 
ANGELA: Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
ANGELA: But I don't see how this is my problem. 
DWIGHT: Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out- 
ANGELA: Ugh. 
DWIGHT: And there's parts of her I don't even recognize. 
ANGELA: Gah. 
DWIGHT: There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap. 
ANGELA: It's fine. 
DWIGHT: It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know? 
ANGELA: Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll- 
DWIGHT: It's a divet... 
ANGELA: I'll help you! 
DWIGHT: ..where it was and it needs, it needs a... 
ANGELA: Ugh. 
ANDY: Where are you going? 
PAM: Uh, not on a three month boat trip. 
ANDY: Wha? Oh, burn.  Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now? 
DWIGHT: How dare you? 
ANDY: I'm still the boss! 
ERIN: I... 
ANDY: The answer is yes. 
ERIN: ..just have some messages for you. 
ANDY: Are they from you? 
ERIN: Well no, they're from clients. 
ANDY: Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it. 
ERIN: I can't. I- 
ANDY: Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing. 
ERIN: These are messages from clients who want to buy paper. 
ANDY: I don't want to talk about work right now. 
ERIN: Well I only want to talk about work right now. 
ANDY: Then I want my big blue sweater back. 
ERIN: Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army. 
PETE: I've got the seat adjusted right. 
CLARK: Perfect height, yeah. 
ANDY: She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about? 
PETE: I was just leaving. 
ANDY: Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the 
SITCH: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first. 
PETE: I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men. 
ANDY: Survey 
SAYS: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got? 
CLARK: Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now. 
ANDY: Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat. 
CLARK: There you go, good for you. 
ANDY: No. 
CLARK: You just let it all hang out, that's what... 
ANDY: May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you.  
CLARK: I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow. 
DWIGHT: Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight. 
SHIRLEY: Oh, lookie here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight. 
ANGELA: Hello Aunt Shirley. 
SHIRLEY: Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny like a little kitchen witch. 
DWIGHT: This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes! 
SHIRLEY: New clothes? What for?  
DWIGHT: OK 
ANGELA: Oh, God. 
DWIGHT: You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit. 
ANGELA: Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath? 
SHIRLEY: How would you like a mean cold slap?  
ANGELA: Ow! 
DWIGHT: Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps? 
SHIRLEY: I could do that. 
DWIGHT: Ok. 
ANGELA: No. No. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, trust me. 
ANGELA: No. 
DWIGHT: It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find. 
SHIRLEY: Step on it! 
ANDY: Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places. 
PHYLLIS: Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping. 
ANDY: I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen. 
OSCAR: You're clearly snooping. 
CREED: That's kinda uncool, man. 
MEREDITH: Ah, come on. 
PHYLLIS: Andy! 
OSCAR: That's her private property. 
MEREDITH: Tell us! 
ANDY: Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now? 
PHYLLIS: What does that even mean? 
MEREDITH: What's it say? 
PHYLLIS: Put it down. 
ANDY: Everyone please, just- 
CREED: It's not cool. 
PHYLLIS: Put it down 
OSCAR: Andy. That is her private property. 
MEREDITH: Boo. 
ANDY: Oh my god. 
STANLEY: Uh huh. 
PHYLLIS: See? 
STANLEY: That's where nosey'll get you. 
PHYLLIS: Told you so. 
ANDY: Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone. 
DARRYL: Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated. 
ANDY: Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete? 
KEVIN: Pete... 
CLARK: Hmm. 
KEVIN: Pete what? 
PETE: It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete. 
PAM:  hello! 
JIM: Hey! There she is.  How you doin? 
PAM: Hi! Hey, do I look ok? 
JIM: You look great. 
PAM: Ok 
JIM: Yeah. 
PAM:  What's that? Is that a- 
JIM: Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands.  
ISAAC: Gotta go, VIP just walked through the door. 
PAM: How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear. 
ISAAC: It's a phone? 
PAM: Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it. 
ISAAC: Of course, anything for Team Halpert. You're gonna crush it, Pam. 
PAM: Thanks. 
JIM: You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you. 
PAM: Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me. 
JIM:  Call you right back. What were you saying? 
PAM: Ha ha. Athlead 
COWORKER: Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line. 
JIM: I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it. OK, good luck! 
PAM: Bye. 
ANGELA: Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly. 
DWIGHT: In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night. 
SHIRLEY:  
DWIGHT: Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down. 
ANGELA: Spray her down? 
DWIGHT: No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic. 
PETE: Hey. 
ANDY: Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted  shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh? 
PETE: Yeah.  You were gone. 
ANDY: I knew it! 
PETE: For a long time, Andy. 
ANDY: You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa! 
PETE: Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap. 
ANDY: No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired! 
PETE: What? 
ANDY: Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry.  So you had a bad day- 
PETE: Andy? 
ANDY: ..The camera don't lie! 
PETE: Andy. 
ANDY: You're being an idiot get.. 
PETE: I'm trying.. 
ANDY: Out of my office, turns out you're fired... 
PETE: Andy. 
ANDY: Because you suck. 
PETE: You can't fire- 
ANDY: And you're fired... 
PETE: If you want to talk to me 
ANDY: So you had a bad day... 
PETE: I'll be in the annex. 
ANDY: Rut ti doh doh... 
PETE: Alright? I'll be in the annex. 
ANDY: Rut tit doh doh... 
PETE: Toby! 
ANDY: Rut ti doh doo doh 
PETE: Toby? 
TOBY: You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right? 
ANDY: No. 
TOBY: Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges. 
ANDY: Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge. 
TOBY: Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin. 
ANDY: They already have a contract?   Mutually agree to-  Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch. 
TOBY: It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it. 
ANDY: Well, I'm not signing away my rights. 
TOBY: I already signed it. I was just showing you. 
ANDY: Ok, well we'll see about that.  
TOBY: Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy.  It's the original. 
MARK: ... talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting...Is that her? Hey guys! Say something. 
PAM: Hello. 
MARK: Hi, I'm Mark. 
PAM: Hi, Pam, hello. 
MARK: I'm the horrible boss around here, but please don't hire Jamie Foxx to kill me. D'Jango! I don't agree with the use of the  N  word in that movie. It's, it's too soon. 
PAM: I'm Pam Halpert. 
MARK: Oh, hi. They call me Marky Mark around here, because here at Simon Realty, we are one funky bunch! Come on you guys, raise the roof when I say that! I- what are you all temps again today? Let's go, Gangnam style.  He's heard Gangnam style, he knows it. Right? That's cause he's American. This is Carl. Uh, he's from here. Our neck of the woods. But Gangnam style is great, isn't it? 
PAM: Oh my god. He's Michael Scott. 
SHIRLEY: Time to get clean! 
DWIGHT: It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose. 
ANGELA: You have to use chains? 
DWIGHT: You'll see. Here we go. 
SHIRLEY: Let's get this show on the road. 
DWIGHT: Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off. 
ANGELA: Dwight! 
DWIGHT: Let's get to it. 
ANGELA: No! No! 
DWIGHT: Give it a whirl. 
ANGELA: Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal. 
SHIRLEY: Stop your belly-aching and hose me. 
DWIGHT: I need you to hose my aunt. 
ANGELA: No Dwight! 
DWIGHT: OK you are useless. 
ANGELA: No, Dwight! 
DWIGHT: Give me the hose! 
ANGELA: No Dwight, I won't-  
DWIGHT: Ahh! OK! 
ANGELA:  I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub? 
DWIGHT: Yes ma'am. 
ANGELA: Good. 
MARK: This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok? 
TOBY: Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up. 
NELLIE: Um. 
TOBY: Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial... 
NELLIE: Oh no. 
TOBY: ...feel like I may have glossed over a few... 
NELLIE: No no no no. 
TOBY: ...minor points. 
NELLIE: No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes. 
TOBY: I've been drafting a letter. 
NELLIE: For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it! 
MARK: My aunt Joan. Oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before I did, so there's no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you I'm probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Ah, cute. Not work on this...work on this months. Ok Nana? Uh, when I say  Chillax  people chillax. Watch this. Hey Roger, chillax! Must not have heard me. 
ROGER: No. I heard you. 
MARK: Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition!  Kids in the Hall. Just, it's not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers. 
PAM:  Oh my god. 
ANDY: Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend. 
MEREDITH: Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk.... 
ANDY: Ugh. 
MEREDITH: Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body. 
PHYLLIS: Come on Andy, they're a good match. 
ANDY: That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings. 
DARRYL: Hey, Andy. 
ANDY: What?! 
DARRYL: You've got a booger bubble going on there. 
ANDY:  Sorry. 
DARRYL: It's ok. 
ANDY: My whole life is a booger bubble! 
MARK: This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom.  From The Smurfs movie. 
PAM: Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural- 
MARK: What does this say here? To ti te per tat... what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it. 
PAM: Oh, cause it was upside down.  
MARK: You're a good audience.  
PAM: So um- 
MARK: Unlike some of these people around here. 
PAM: Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the- 
MARK: Yeah, we don't have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume and here's why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah. You don't jump ship easily. Like a lot of these people. I mean they worship me you know? But do they like me? I mean...you think they like me, Pam? 
PAM: Yes. 
MARK:  What if Bob Dylan was your boss? I'm gonna do Dylan!  Pam Halpert is my name, and I've been at Dunder Mifflin for seven years? Eight years? Eight years, man. Got the Dunder Mifflin blues. Got the Pam Halpert blues. Got the pra- went to the Pratt Institute...You have children? 
PAM: Two children, yes. 
MARK: You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that's just being Pam. Well I'm kinda cute and I'm- but I'm married so...leave that be. 
PETE: Hey. You got a sec to talk? 
ANDY: Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. 
TRANSLATION: penis. Translation? My manhood. 
PETE: Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on. 
ANDY: Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now. 
ERIN: Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear. 
ANDY: Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in. 
PETE: Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now. 
ERIN: See? We can all be friends! 
PETE: Yeah. 
ERIN: Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward. 
PETE: I do think we can have a fair.... 
ANDY: Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun. 
MARK: Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don't- not allowed to ask. So... 
PAM: I am not pr- 
MARK: You're not. 
PAM: Pregnant, no. 
MARK: I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant. 
PAM: Wow. 
MARK: Don't be afraid, it's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone- 
PAM: I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager. 
MARK: It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again. 
PAM: So, kinda like a receptionist. 
MARK: Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show? 
PAM: Yes. 
MARK: Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted. 
PAM: I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't. 
SHIRLEY: Ow! The braid is too tight. 
ANGELA: Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still. 
SHIRLEY: Yes ma'am. 
ANGELA: I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way. 
SHIRLEY: Ok. 
ANGELA: There. 
SHIRLEY: Thank you Angela. 
TOBY: I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler. 
NELLIE: Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler. 
DARRYL: Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name. 
TOBY: Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it.  
NELLIE: He's doing it. 
PAM:  hey! 
JIM: Hey, how'd the interview go? 
PAM: Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so- 
JIM: I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in. 
PAM: Eight? Really? 
JIM: I'll make it worth your while, I promise. 
PAM: Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight. 
JIM: Alright, love you. 
PAM: Love you. 
ALICE: Hi. 
ERIN: Hi. 
ALICE: I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard. 
ERIN: Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk. 
ALICE: Ok, great. Thanks. 
MEREDITH: Fresh meat! Fresh meat!  
ERIN: Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way. 
ALICE: Nice to meet you. Cute sweater. 
ERIN: Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk. 
KEVIN: I'm Kevin. 
ALICE: Pete? 
PETE: Alice. Oh man. 
ALICE: It's uh, been a while, huh? 
ERIN: What, do you two know each other? 
PETE: Yeah. We uh, have a history. 
ERIN: Oh. 
ALICE: History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years. 
ERIN: That's so random. 
PETE: Well. Is it? 
ERIN: Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no.  
CREED: Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man. 
GABE: Hello beautiful. 
KEVIN: Didn't you two used to do it? 
GABE: We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that. 
CREED: She's looking good. 
TOBY: Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb. 
TOBY: This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it?  I think this is a start of my first friendship. 
CLARK: So Pete was a librarian? 
ALICE: He worked as a librarian freshman year. 
CLARK: Was he like the sexy librarian? 
PETE: Ok. 
ALICE: Is there like somebody who's in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her. 
ANDY: Hi. 
ALICE: Hi. 
ANDY: Hi, how's it going? 
ALICE: Hi.  Good. I'd love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing p- 
ANDY: Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with? 
PETE: Andy, that is really inappropriate. 
ANDY: Awkward. 
PETE: It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived. 
ANDY:  Really uncomfortable situation. 
PETE: Yeah. 
ANDY: It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta  move on . Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm.  
ALICE: So there's no marketing department. 
CLARK: No. 
PETE: No. 
GABE: You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin. 
ERIN: So Andy just called you up out of the blue? 
GABE: Yeah. He told me you two broke up. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
GABE: You must be pretty horny.  
NELLIE: well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal?  One week?  Ok, two weeks?  Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave. 
SHIRLEY: I feel like a show pony. 
DWIGHT: And you look like one too. Thank you Angela. 
ANGELA: You're welcome. Would you like some stew? 
DWIGHT: By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela? 
ANGELA: Mmhm. 
DWIGHT: Would you like the stink sack? 
ANGELA: Is it any good? 
DWIGHT: No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack. 
ANGELA: Thank you.  
SHIRLEY: So, when's the wedding? 
ANGELA: Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends. 
SHIRLEY: That's what Mose said about his lady scarecrow and look what he did to that poor thing. 
PAM: Hello? 
JIM: Hey! Back here. 
PAM: Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne? 
JIM: Si, senor. 
PAM: Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job. 
JIM: Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright? 
PAM: Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate. 
JIM: Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here. 
PAM:  You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny. 
JIM: Alright. So, tell me all about it. 
DWIGHT: Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you. 
ANGELA: It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon.  Dwight, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse. 
ANGELA: No, Dwight. The Senator. 
DWIGHT: Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey. 
ANGELA: I can't be your monkey, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you. 
ANGELA: I made a vow. I gave my word. 
DWIGHT: Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine. 
ANGELA: Good night, D. 
ERIN: How are you doing? Is it really rough? 
PETE: It is so unpleasant. You? 
ANDY: Hey, love turds. Conference room, now. 
ANDY: Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day? 
GABE: Honestly, it was a little weird. 
ANDY: Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item? 
GABE: I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship- 
ERIN: Gabe! 
GABE: ...a lot of the time. 
ANDY: And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch. 
PETE: Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy. 
ALICE: Ok, while we're rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem. 
PETE: It was college. That is what you do. 
ALICE: Yeah you're also supposed to go to classes, so there's that. 
ERIN: Hey, Andy, is this at all work related? 
ANDY: We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you? 
GABE:  Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out. 
ERIN: Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican. 
GABE: I got a tattoo for you. 
ERIN: I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you! 
GABE: Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing. 
ALICE: So you're dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete. 
PETE: She's nice to me. 
ALICE: How's that P.E. degree coming? That's what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher. 
ERIN: Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's- 
GABE: I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle. 
PETE: Oh my god. 
GABE: What kind of music are you into, Peter? 
PETE: Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe. 
GABE: Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan? 
PETE: No! 
GABE: Erin, are you even hearing this? 
ERIN: He didn't even say that. 
ALICE: He is not a very sophisticated man, I mean he can't even use chopsticks, so. Do I need to say anything else? 
GABE: Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night. 
ERIN: Gabe, I don't- 
GABE: Give me one night with you... 
ERIN: What is that supposed to mean? 
GABE: I have shaved everything... 
ERIN: I don't want you to shave everything. 
ALICE: I wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?! 
PETE: I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man.  
GABE: I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues] 
PETE: Why don't you say in the 
BEGINNING:  This isn't really going that well  
GABE: Shove his sashimi! 
ERIN: What do you-! 
ALICE: Because I had to wait-  
ANDY: Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better?  Yeah. Yeah, it does. 
PAM: So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura. 
JIM: Tell me about the cologne. How much? 
PAM: Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least. 
JIM: You're definitely hoarding this by the way. 
PAM: Guess what poster he had on his wall? 
JIM: Austin Powers. 
PAM: MmMm. 
JIM: Ferris Bueller. 
PAM: MmMm. You're getting colder. 
JIM: Not Night at the Roxbury. 
PAM:  No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green. 
JIM: I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that? 
PAM: I don't know, but it's interesting right? 
JIM: It's fascinating. 
PAM: He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day. 
JIM: That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right? 
PAM: Mmhm. 
JIM: So, next interview has to be better. 
PAM: I don't know. 
JIM: What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing. 
PAM: I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this. 
JIM:  Huh. This is a little out of left field. 
PAM: Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton. 
JIM: And I have started a business in Philadelphia.  Oscar's 
COMPUTER: My grandfather know. Mah Jong will be here to stay. Hobbies of the East continues in a moment. 
OSCAR: You could all be doing this, just saying. 
OSCAR: I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online. 
STANLEY: Why can't you just do regular sit-ups? 
OSCAR: I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright  Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy? 
KEVIN: Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now? 
OSCAR: Can someone please help me? 
PHYLLIS: Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please?  
OSCAR: Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me?  I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good.  Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza? 
DWIGHT:  Hold it! 
CREED:  New glasses. 
ERIN: Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are. 
DWIGHT: I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died. 
PAM: Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close? 
DWIGHT: I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother. 
DWIGHT: My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt. 
JIM: My condolences. 
DWIGHT: Keep them. 
JIM: OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails? 
DWIGHT: In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil. 
ERIN:  What color is it? 
PHYLLIS: It looks pretty black. 
KEVIN:  Yep. Acidic, all right. 
OSCAR:  Oh, thank god. 
DWIGHT: Excuse me? 
OSCAR: I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session... 
DWIGHT: OK. That's not...  
OSCAR: I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch. 
JIM:  I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place. 
DWIGHT: I really hope so.  
JIM: OK.  This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball. 
DWIGHT: I miss her so much. 
JIM: OK. 
DWIGHT: You know?  
MOSE:  Zeke's here. 
DWIGHT: Zeke. 
ZEKE: Hey, Dwight. Mose, Mom says 'hi'. 
MOSE: 'Hi' to Mom. 
DWIGHT: Are you going? 
MOSE: Will there be ghosts there? 
DWIGHT:  Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar. 
ZEKE: You get in the sidecar. 
DWIGHT: Get... 
DWIGHT:  What are you doing here? 
OSCAR: You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, yeah. 
OSCAR:  Who is that? 
DWIGHT: Jeb, my brother. 
OSCAR: You have a brother? 
DWIGHT: Uh-huh. 
JEB: I didn't really see a better parking spot.  Whoa! Look what I did. It's a rental.  You wanna go in?  
ERIN:  Oh, gosh. Todd 
PACKER: Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours. 
CLARK:  Who's this guy? 
PAM:   bad. Todd 
PACKER: Hi, all. 
PHYLLIS: Why are you here, Todd? Todd 
PACKER: OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did. 
KEVIN: Packer, we accept.  Todd 
PACKER: Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff. OK. Uh, where to begin.  Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys.  Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin,  this kid in a few years. 
PAM: Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology. Todd 
PACKER: Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology s just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'. 
PAM: I think it's called 'Nibbles'. Todd 
PACKER: Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh?  There you go. 
PAM: Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake. German 
MINISTER: We are here today to join this woman and the ground. Man is born of woman and his life is full of turmoil. 
JEB:  Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here. 
DWIGHT: Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery. 
JEB: Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all. 
DWIGHT: Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies. 
JEB: It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow. 
DWIGHT: Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies. 
JEB: Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any. German 
MINISTER: Would the family care to say something? 
DWIGHT: You had black hair and then gray hair. 
ZEKE: You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life you were 5'4 , at the end you were 5'1 . 
OSCAR: They're a descriptive people. 
FANNIE:  I see you started without me. 
DWIGHT: You were late. So, what am I supposed to do? 
FANNIE: Well, I told you... 
JEB: Hi, Fannie. 
FANNIE: Hey. 
OSCAR: Who is that? 
ZEKE: Dwight's sister. 
OSCAR: Dwight has a sister? 
ZEKE: Yeah. 
OSCAR: She's beautiful. 
ZEKE: Blugh. 
DWIGHT:  Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years.  What is this? Oh, god.  Henry. 
HENRY: Dwight. 
DWIGHT: I see Esther's back in town. 
ESTHER: Hi Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today. 
ESTHER: This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn. 
DWIGHT: Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens. 
FANNIE: We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here. 
DWIGHT: OK. 
HENRY: Anyone mention her height? 
ZEKE: Yep. 
HENRY: Land size?   Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's.  OK.  
DWIGHT: So, let's get it going. German 
MINISTER:  Would you want to do the honors? 
FANNIE: Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this. 
DWIGHT: We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness. 
OSCAR:  That's it for me.  
PAM: I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction. 
PHYLLIS: I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy. 
PAM: We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity? 
CREED: $3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen. 
CREED: I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant. 
CLARK: Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark. Todd 
PACKER: Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier. 
CLARK: You didn't actually say that. Todd 
PACKER: No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head.  Hey. I have a crazy feeling  that you are really gonna like this. 
STANLEY: Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank.  And you did fire him. 
NELLIE: I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong. 
PAM: Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart? 
ANGELA: Do they even have a bakery anymore? 
KEVIN: They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day. 
PAM: So, it really is just about the cupcakes. 
ANDY: Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes. 
PHYLLIS: So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes? 
MEREDITH:  OK. 
PHYLLIS: OK. Packer can go to hell. Aunt 
SHIRLEY:  Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you. Aunt 
SHIRLEY: Jeb. A street pusher. 
JEB: After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out  worm  means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of... pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management. 
DWIGHT: I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich. Aunt 
SHIRLEY: We can't just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So, here are my terms. Dwight, Fannie, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. So, there, you have it. 
FANNIE: Is she crazy?  Dwight? 
JEB: Buddy? Buddy? 
FANNIE: No, no, no. 
JEB: Snap out of it. Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom. 
FANNIE: No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy? 
DWIGHT: Of course you are. 
FANNIE: Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication. 
DWIGHT: Oh my god. 
FANNIE: That Cammy and I are drawn to. And, I don't know. The men are just... it's almost like there's a... a willing ignorance. 
FANNIE: Yes. I, thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And, I was recently published. Which is just...  maybe I have. Yep. I do. Here it is from the um, Hartford Women's Lit Quarterly.com. A Willing Ignorance by Fannie Schrute. 
JEB: Totally. Yep. The people here are like  Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart? 
DWIGHT: You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer. 
JEB: Couple of nights couldn't hurt. 
FANNIE: Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt. 
DWIGHT: You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes. 
ZEKE:  Absolutely. 
ZEKE: Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one. And, Mose was the visionary. Which left me to be the comedian. 
FANNIE: That doesn't work on me. 
DWIGHT: OK. 
FANNIE: By the way, that's not... 
DWIGHT:  
FANNIE: Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui. 
DWIGHT: Oui. 
FANNIE: Oh my goodness. 
DWIGHT:  People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck. 
FANNIE:  So, I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then, if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks.  Todd 
PACKER: Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for screwing you. 
MEREDITH: I'm not sorry about it. Todd 
PACKER: I am. It was my rock bottom. 
ANGELA:  Kevin, you can do this. 
KEVIN: You don't know that. 
PAM: Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right? 
ANGELA: Uh-huh. 
KEVIN: James Bond was a spy. 
PAM: Yes. He was a good spy. 
KEVIN: Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake. Todd 
PACKER: Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care.  Todd 
PACKER: I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a  of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it. 
PAM: Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing.  Hey! 
ANGELA: What, Pam? 
PAM:  Wait! 
ANGELA: He's gone. It's just a cupcake now. 
PAM: No, no. It's the principle of the thing. 
ANDY:  Oh my god. I forgive him so much.  Whoa, is he choking? 
ANGELA: Kevin? 
KEVIN:  Oh, that was fantastic. 
CAMERON:  Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them? 
DWIGHT: Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens. 
CAMERON: I was just asking you something I didn't know. 
DWIGHT: Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit. 
CAMERON:  Are we gonna eat these today? 
DWIGHT: If you want. 
CAMERON: Is that a guillotine? 
DWIGHT: This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking. 
CAMERON:  That's a cow? 
DWIGHT: Did you just ask me if this was a cow? 
CAMERON:  What are you doing now? 
DWIGHT: Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right? 
CAMERON: I don't know. 
DWIGHT: Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy? 
CAMERON: I don't know any of that. 
DWIGHT: OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything? 
CAMERON: I never met him. 
PAM: Good morning, Erin. 
ERIN:  Hey. 
PAM: Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK. 
PHYLLIS: I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise. 
PAM: Phyllis! 
CLARK: Packer laced the cupcakes. 
PAM: No! 
MEREDITH: Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned? 
ANGELA: Some of us got both.  
PAM: Oh my god! Is everyone OK? 
PHYLLIS: Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars. 
NELLIE: Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet. 
STANLEY: Me too.  
CLARK: I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night. 
PHYLLIS: What did you do, Andy? 
ANDY: Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know.  Na, nothing really. Kevin? 
KEVIN: Why would you ask me? 
ANDY: I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know.  Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um.  Pretty normal night. 
KEVIN:  My night was just like that.  Meaning normal. 
ANDY: Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all.  
KEVIN: Nope. I did not see you either. 
PAM: Wow. He is officially the worst human being. 
KEVIN:  Ah.  
PAM: But, Kevin that's... 
KEVIN: Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand. 
ANGELA:  No. Todd 
PACKER: So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends.  
DARRYL: That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage. 
JIM: Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too. Todd 
PACKER: It's OK. I'm over it. 
JEB: Oof. This is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Not it. 
FANNIE: Not it. 
DWIGHT: It.  That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that. 
FANNIE: All right. 
KEVIN: Uh oh. She's doing it again. 
PAM: Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey. Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um... 
CLARK: It's porn. 
PAM: Yeah. 
DWIGHT:  Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment. 
PHYLLIS: Why? 
DARRYL: Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public. 
PAM: Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit. 
MEREDITH: Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish. 
GROUP: Ugh. Ew. 
ANDY: What? 
DWIGHT: Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak. 
ANGELA: Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her? 
TOBY: He- he can't do that. Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal. It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it. 
GROUP: No! 
OSCAR: Toby, how do you propose that we- Andy:Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused? 
PAM: She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey. 
ANDY: Well there you go. That's muy caliente. 
DWIGHT: OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this.  
PHYLLIS: What the hell?! 
DWIGHT: It's OK guys, she's no longer horny. 
ANDY: Excuse me, dirty birdie  
PHYLLIS: Wait, what? 
ANDY: You can have this back at the end of the day.  Oh!! 
DWIGHT: Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles. 
CLARK: What's her name? 
DWIGHT: Esther Ruger.  
CLARK: Sweet. 
DWIGHT: Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres. 
CLARK: Oh yeah. Keep talkin'. 
DWIGHT: Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me. 
CLARK: Oh. 
DWIGHT:  What do you think? 
CLARK: The same thing that you think. 
DWIGHT: A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship. 
CLARK: God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air. 
ANGELA: Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes. 
ANGELA: Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther. She's coming here this afternoon with her father. Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart!  
PAM:  Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week. 
JIM: Oh man.  
PAM: I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'. 
JIM: Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen. 
PAM:  Um. 
JIM: What was I gonna- What was I gonna say? 
PAM: You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen? 
JIM: Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman. 
PAM: Oh, oh OK. 
JIM: Yeah, yeah. Exactly. 
PAM:  Um, Ok. Well? 
JIM: Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later? 
PAM: Yeah, sounds good. Ok. 
JIM: Ok great. 
PAM: Ok. 
JIM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye. 
KEVIN:  What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song? 
OSCAR: There's a promo for the new documentary on the web. 
PHYLLIS: Play it again. Promo 
VOICE:  The boss.  The workers.  The lives.  The loves.  The people. The paper. The 
OFFICE: An American Workplace. Coming soon on WVIA. 
KEVIN: Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes. 
KEVIN: This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo. 
KEVIN:  Did you see this?  
ANGELA: Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer. 
CLARK:  Oh my god, is that you and Jim? 
PAM: Uh huh. 
CLARK: Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really?  Yikes. That is awful. 
PAM: It wasn't so bad. 
ANDY: Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing.  Banjo at 0:19 is aight  Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy. I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler? 
JIM: Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert. Ryan 
HOWARD: Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh. 
DARRYL: Hey, man. Darryl. Ryan 
HOWARD: Hey there, Ryan. Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh.  Eat Fresh. 
JIM: Let's go to the conference room. 
DWIGHT: Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots. 
ANGELA: I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth. 
DWIGHT: Did I tell you about her teeth? 
ERIN: Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome. Mr. 
RUGER: Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always. 
ESTHER: Thank you.  
ANGELA: I guess men find Esther attractive. I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing. 
PAM: Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much. 
STANLEY:  We've all changed. 
JIM: With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number. 
DARRYL: And we all know, baseball does not last forever. Ryan 
HOWARD: I look at these actors on TV and I 
THINK:  C'mon, I can do that.  
JIM: Right?  Ryan 
HOWARD: Watch 
THIS: Eat Fresh. Now what does that make you think of? 
DARRYL: Subway sandwiches. 
JIM: Yep. Ryan 
HOWARD: How? I didn't say Subway sandwiches. It's called playing the subtext. 
JIM: Wow. Ryan 
HOWARD: I actually wrote a screenplay, it's called  The Big Piece  
JIM: Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical. Ryan 
HOWARD: Half biopic and half superhero movie. A mild mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard- 
JIM: OK Ryan 
HOWARD: -hits a home run into outer space. Ball comes back with space dust on it, which transforms him 
INTO: The Big Piece. 
DARRYL: The space dust does it. 
JIM: Space dust. 
DARRYL: Yeah. Ryan 
HOWARD: I actually brought a- some copies of my script if you guys wanna read it together. 
JIM: Sure, yeah.  Hollywood.  Alright. 
DARRYL: Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it. 
JIM: Ok, great. 
KEVIN: Andy, are there documentary groupies? 
ANDY: Of course there are! 
KEVIN: Of course. 
TOBY: A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel  was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen- 
NELLIE: Oh, I don't care. 
OSCAR: Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark. 
PAM: Oh my god! Promo 
ANNOUNCER:  
KEVIN: What was that word they said when they showed me  Skrald mand ? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy?  
OSCAR: Dumpster Man. 
KEVIN: Cool. Superhero. 
ANGELA: What about me?  Klokken tre pige  
OSCAR:  Three PM Girl  
ANGELA: What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that?  Oh! I didn't know they were filming then! 
OSCAR: It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves. 
PHYLLIS: Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it? 
ANGELA: Oh my god.  
ANGELA: There was much more secret filming than I expected.  But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am. 
OSCAR: Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage. 
MEREDITH: I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste?  Boob sauce! 
GROUP: No! 
OSCAR: Meredith! 
ANGELA: Come on! 
NELLIE: Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping? 
OSCAR: Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV! 
ERIN: Hey. 
ANGELA: Oscar. 
OSCAR: I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out. 
OSCAR: I have been very honest with you guys. In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine. You're not going to use any of that, are you? 
ANDY: People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon 
SAYS:  You guys are killing it!  I mean, we're internet sensations guys! 
ANGELA: I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk. 
STANLEY: Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea.  
OSCAR: Ok everyone, turn off your mikes. 
ANGELA: We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape? 
ERIN: I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that? 
NELLIE: My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more  I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone. 
PETE: Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got. 
PAM: Brian? 
PETE: Yeah. 
PAM: Yeah, I guess I could. 
STANLEY: Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me. 
PHYLLIS: I thought Terry knew about Cynthia? 
STANLEY: She does. But neither of them know about Lydia. 
GROUP: Oh! 
MEREDITH: Wow. 
CLARK: Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do? Ruger Sister 
1: That manipulates the secondary shaft. 
CLARK: Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga!  
SALESMEN: The lift capacity's up at two thousand pounds. That's a lot of beets. Mr. 
RUGER: Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns. 
DWIGHT: Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal. Mr. 
RUGER: Esther, get in the truck. 
DWIGHT: Ok ok ok, wait! You win.  
SALESMAN: Let's get the paperwork started. Ruger Sister 
2: We should buy an auger together. 
CLARK: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Ruger Sister 
1: You would be a great one to buy an auger with. 
STANLEY:  Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring. 
ANDY: Oh! Seven new comments.  The guy at 0:19 is hawt!    Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!   He's not hawt, he's gay.    Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.    He is hawt!  See, thank you, that's more like it.  He is butt.  God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh! 
DWIGHT: Security deposit. That's been- Mr. 
RUGER: Standard. 
DWIGHT: Right, standard. 
CLARK: Hey, can I talk to you for one second? 
DWIGHT: No. 
CLARK: One second. 
DWIGHT: No. 
CLARK: One second. 
DWIGHT: I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate. 
CLARK: Don't do it.  
DWIGHT: What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off. 
CLARK: Dude, we're being conned. 
DWIGHT: Go on. 
CLARK: These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor. 
DWIGHT: No. 
CLARK: Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her. 
DWIGHT: What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now? 
CLARK: I don't even know what an auger is! 
DWIGHT: No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is. Mr. 
RUGER: Hey, you ready to sign? 
DWIGHT: I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me.  
BRIAN: Oh, hey! 
PAM: Hey! 
BRIAN: Hi.  
PAM: Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time? 
BRIAN: No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this- 
PAM: Oh my gosh, please, don't. 
BRIAN: Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this.  Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there. 
PAM: Sure, yeah. Yeah. 
BRIAN: Let me grab a couple drinks. 
PAM: OK.  Oh wow, you have a nice view. 
BRIAN: Alright, that's for you.  
PAM: Oh, thank you. 
BRIAN: Cheers. 
PAM: Cheers. 
ANGELA:  Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator? 
OSCAR: They caught us kissing on Halloween. 
ANGELA: Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan!  
OSCAR: Oh! 
ANGELA: God! 
OSCAR: Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy! 
ANGELA: Oh!  Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career. 
OSCAR: Well, I don't like giving him bad news. 
ANGELA: Call him! 
OSCAR: You call him! 
ANGELA: Call him!  
OSCAR: Stop hitting me! 
ANGELA: Call him! Call him! 
OSCAR: No! 
BRIAN: So... 
PAM: So.. 
BRIAN: What brings you by? 
PAM: Well, the promo for the documentary aired today. 
BRIAN: Oh yeah, that's right. 
PAM: Yeah. It's kinda crazy. 
BRIAN: Yeah, it is. 
PAM: See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof? 
BRIAN: Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment. 
PAM: Yeah, wasn't that neat? 
BRIAN: Yeah, it was cool. 
PAM: Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed? 
BRIAN: Um... 
PAM: I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue- 
BRIAN: No no, it's- 
PAM: I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy? 
BRIAN: No, you're not crazy. 
PAM: Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out.  Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera- 
BRIAN: Yeah. 
PAM: You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much. 
BRIAN: They want to know how much what? 
PAM: How much stuff you got. 
BRIAN: Pretty much everything. 
PAM: Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs? 
BRIAN: They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you. 
PAM: So we basically had no privacy for ten years. 
BRIAN: That's not really true, I mean- 
PAM: Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go. 
BRIAN: Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better. 
PAM: No I think you explained it. 
BRIAN: Look, if you give me a chance I can, I-  Pam. 
JIM:  Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.  Ryan 
HOWARD: That'll pay for the exploding helicopter. 
JIM: Smart. Ryan 
HOWARD:  Suddenly, the evil thugs break in to the stadium. The Big Piece hits baseballs at the evil thugs.  
JIM:  Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.  Ryan 
HOWARD: Come on man, sell it! 
DARRYL: Yeah, Jim. 
JIM:   Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!  Ryan 
HOWARD: Yeah, that's better. A bunch of hot women 
GO:  Oh yeah!  
JIM:  Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.  Ryan 
HOWARD:  They kiss. It is super emotional. Like in Toy Story.  
JIM: Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends. 
DARRYL: It's so strong. Ryan 
HOWARD: Keep reading then. 
JIM:  Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.  Ryan 
HOWARD: Um another thing. I'm gonna need you to get me the rights to Darth Vader. 
JIM: I don't know how we'd go about doing that. 
DARRYL: We can look into it. 
JIM: We'll look into it. Ryan 
HOWARD: We need Darth. 
JIM: We gotta get him. 
DARRYL: We'll go after Darth then. 
JIM: We're gonna go get him. 
DARRYL: That's what we gotta do. 
JIM: We're gonna get him. 
DWIGHT: Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me. 
CLARK: A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours. 
DWIGHT: Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy. 
CLARK: Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way. 
DWIGHT: By hand. 
ESTHER: Dwight, we need to talk. 
DWIGHT: I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther. 
ESTHER: Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends. 
DWIGHT: No. 
ESTHER: So you're going to be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles and he's pocketing a profit behind your back. 
DWIGHT: That snake! 
ESTHER: You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine. 
DWIGHT: That shady grove out by Willard's pond. 
ESTHER: Mmhm. 
DWIGHT: So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed? 
ESTHER: Of course.  You didn't just think I was tractor bait, did you? 
DWIGHT:  No! 
CLARK: Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for? 
DWIGHT: Post hole digging.  
ESTHER: Stupid. 
SENATOR:  You've reached Senator Robert Lipton, please leave a message.  Angela & 
OSCAR: Hi honey! 
OSCAR: Oh you? 
ANGELA: No you go. Hi honey! 
OSCAR: Hey, Hey Robert! 
ANGELA: It's Angela and Oscar. 
OSCAR: Hey. 
ANGELA: Just a few quick things. 
OSCAR: Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos. 
ANGELA: Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential. 
OSCAR: Very much so. 
ANGELA: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Absolutely. 
ANGELA: Yeah! 
OSCAR: Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay. 
ANGELA: Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it. 
OSCAR: I think that's it! 
ANGELA: I think we're good. 
OSCAR: Done! 
ANGELA: Bye! 
OSCAR: Ok! 
ANGELA: Love you!  God. 
ANDY:  Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out.  
NELLIE: Good night Andy. 
ANDY: Huh? Yeah, see ya.  Oh! What?!  Promo 
ANNOUNCER:  
PAM: I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that.  
STANLEY:  What the hell? No. This is NOT happening. 
ERIN: Didn t you get the memo? It s Stairmageddon!  Come on Stanley!  
ERIN: Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It s a   Mageddon!  
ERIN: Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it! 
STANLEY:  I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they re making me climb Stair Mountain! 
ERIN: Come on!  
OSCAR: Our office has an unusually large number of  unusually large people. 
STANLEY: This is an abomination. 
ERIN: Come on. You got this. Here. 
OSCAR: So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time. 
ANDY: Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in. 
OSCAR: What? 
ANDY: I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There s a review of the documentary! 
PHYLLIS:  What does it say? 
ANDY: I don t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming,  Red Alert.  
DWIGHT: Well, the alert was already set to  Red  because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to  Double Red ? 
ANDY: I think we should. 
STANLEY:  
OSCAR:  The 
OFFICE: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!  
EVERYONE: Whoo!  
NELLIE:  In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There s Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.  
DWIGHT: What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news thing. 
NELLIE:  Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.  
PHYLLIS: Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that s-. 
ANDY: It s okay.  The hell does he know? 
NELLIE:  A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.  
ANDY: I want you to print that out for me. 
NELLIE: I will. 
ANDY: Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation s Lisa Loeb. 
ERIN:  Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.  
NELLIE: Oh! Which public figure? 
ERIN: I bet it s Katie Couric. I ve been saying this for years. 
PHYLLIS: No, I think they mean more like a politician. 
STANLEY:  You own the building. Why can t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee? 
DWIGHT: Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could ve met in the lobby. It s time to go out on a sale! Here we go. 
STANLEY: Son, you ve lost your mind. I m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator. 
DWIGHT: The buyer is your sister s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that s an order. 
STANLEY: You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams. 
PETE: Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up. 
PAM: Well, we won t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks. 
NELLIE: Oh, your mom s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to?  Oh, um, Embassy Suites.  Do Not Disturb  sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor. 
PAM:  I wish. 
NELLIE:  What, then? 
PAM: Oh, nothing that exciting. 
NELLIE: Marriage counseling? 
PAM: Hmm. 
NELLIE: Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had? 
PAM: You know, Jim s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help. 
NELLIE: Mmm. 
PAM: I mean, we ve having issues. It can t hurt to talk about them, right? 
JIM: Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question. 
TOBY: Oh, sure. 
JIM: It s a little, uh, personal. 
TOBY: Let s do it. Let s get personal. 
JIM: I wanted to talk to you about your divorce. 
TOBY: Whoa. 
JIM: Sorry. I no, no, no, what I meant what I meant actually was  
TOBY: Oh, yeah, no, it s okay. I can handle it. Um, so  
JIM: You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it. 
TOBY:  
JIM: Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple s counseling. 
TOBY: Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren t in couple s counseling, are you? Oh, God. 
JIM: No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we re just starting couple s counseling. Uh, which doesn t sound any better. 
TOBY: Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here. 
CLARK: My mistake. 
TOBY: Yes, it is your mistake. He s lingering. So annoying. I m gonna kill him. How can I help? I m here. 
JIM: That s all right. 
ANDY: Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I ll hold. I m sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye.  
ANGELA: Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey.  Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls. 
ROBERT: Don t worry. I ve scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on. 
ANGELA: All right, if I have to be the good wife, I ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I m a better wife than that.  
DWIGHT: Andy  I need to talk to you. 
ANDY: Yeah, come on in. I m just on hold with another talent agency. It s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there s more. 251. 252. I can t even keep up! 
DWIGHT: Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call. 
ANDY:  I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That s final. 
DWIGHT: So what I m hearing you say is,  Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible ? 
ANDY: Yes! I m sorry I m being curt, it s just I m about to land a top talent agent. 
DWIGHT: Mm-hmm. Good luck. 
ANDY:  Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory. 
DWIGHT: For five years I ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it s time for me to just let that thought go. It s kind of painful, but it s also freeing in a way. Now it s all about my instincts. 
CLARK: Hey, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale. 
STANLEY: Pass. 
CLARK: Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next? 
DWIGHT: Don t worry, it s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker. 
STANLEY: Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha  
DWIGHT:  
CLARK: Holy . 
STANLEY: No, you didn t. Sick of you and your ooh  
DWIGHT:  
STANLEY:  
DWIGHT: It s all right. Andy approved it. 
MEREDITH: Man, he s really in twinkle town now. 
CLARK: Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him? 
DWIGHT: Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley s got way more body fat than they do. 
CLARK: You gave him three shots. 
DWIGHT: Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to.  Grab his feet.  Let s go! 
CLARK: All right. 
DWIGHT: Move it! One, two, three.  
DWIGHT: He s like a manatee. Ready? Let s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three!  Oh, God. No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain. 
CLARK: We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT:  Okay, we re good. We re good. Let s go. Push! 
CLARK: I am! 
CLARK: Any good weekend plans? 
DWIGHT: I might see a movie. 
CLARK: Nice. 
DWIGHT: What about you? 
CLARK: Uh, I don t know yet. 
DWIGHT:  Let s take him  
CLARK: I was thinking about  
DWIGHT: Let s go right to the top of the stairs, okay? 
CLARK: And then what? 
DWIGHT: Okay, listen. I m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I ve never actually done this before. 
CLARK: Well, if I may, you re a natural. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. I mean, I ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh  
CLARK: That s a little weird. 
DWIGHT: I know. Evel Knievel. 
DWIGHT:  
CLARK:  That s about as good as that s gonna be. 
DWIGHT: Okay, now here s the plan. I m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him. 
CLARK: Catch? 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
CLARK: I can t catch him. He s like, 250 pounds. 
DWIGHT: You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He s gonna be moving slowly. It s only  
CLARK: Blunt? 
DWIGHT: It s 15 feet down, it s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it s like your catching a medicine  
CLARK: Dude, this size of my haunches   
DWIGHT: Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall. 
CLARK: We should probably call a doctor or something, dude. 
DWIGHT:  You okay? 
JIM: So how does it work? It s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or  
TOBY: You re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
TOBY: He might start by asking each of you,  Why do you think you re here?  
PAM: He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he shouldn't be rewarded for that. 
JIM: If I didn t do certain things without telling Pam, she d be married to Roy.  
PAM: I feel like he s always making these decisions for the family, and then I m left playing catch-up. 
JIM: If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I this will be so huge for our family. 
TOBY: Well, what s a little while? 
JIM: What do you mean? 
TOBY: I mean, what s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn t know when it s gonna end. 
JIM: That s kind of an impossible question. 
ERIN: Oh, guys, it s starting! Hurry! 
KEVIN: Ooh, there s Angela! I work with her! 
ANDY: Huh, yeah.  I mean, I m happy Angela s the first one getting famous, but it s a little weird, no? I mean, she can t sing or act, so it s actually kind of insane, if you think about it. 
PHYLLIS: Her hair looks beautiful. 
ANDY: Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin  movie star!  
ERIN: Andy! 
ROBERT:  I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest  I am gay. 
CROWD:  Reporter 
#1: Senator, were always gay, or did your wife turn you gay? Reporter 
#2: Question for the Senator s beard. 
ROBERT:  I ll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual. 
PETE: Poor Angela. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. Poor Angela. 
ROBERT: I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn t until my marriage to Angela that I realized how charmless I find the female body. 
MEREDITH: Oof. Always hurts to hear that one. 
ROBERT: There s someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez. 
ANDY: Come on! 
ROBERT: Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time  
ERIN: Oscar is with the Senator too? 
KEVIN: Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn t know, you didn t know, and you didn t freaking know. But I knew!  
OSCAR: He knew! 
KEVIN: Yes, we did it! 
OSCAR: You did it, Kevin. 
KEVIN: Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it. 
ROBERT: --with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing  Chief of Staff Wesley Silver. 
OSCAR: What?! 
CREED: Wesley Silver s gay? 
CROWD:  
ANGELA:  
KEVIN: Ohh. 
CREED: They make a nice couple. 
ANGELA:  
DWIGHT: Almost there. Almost there.  Okay. We re running late. Let s get him inside. 
CLARK: We can t just leave him bubble wrapped like this. 
DWIGHT: Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation. 
CLARK: That s actually really smart. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
CLARK: God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge. 
DWIGHT: Let s get him inside. 
ANDY: Carla Fern is not just an actor s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate. 
ANDY: Actor? 
MAN: Oh, no.  Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse. 
ANDY: Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that? 
MAN: Eh, you go through a lot of mice. 
MAN: If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second. 
ANDY: Does anything go on top of the mouse? 
MAN: Yeah. Little hat. 
ANDY: Aw, that s cute. 
MAN: Yeah. 
ANDY: What s the mouse s name? 
MAN: Eh, you know, it really doesn t make sense to name the mice. They re kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You re not one of those PETA guys , are you?  Oh, great. 
CLARK: Hey, wait, wait, how how are we doing this? 
DWIGHT: Well, I ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters. 
CLARK: Just say  arms  and  legs,  okay? That just that s the vernacular that I m comfortable with. 
DWIGHT: Fine, let s go.  
CLARK:  
DWIGHT: Hoist his shank on three. 
CLARK: Wha What s a shank? 
DWIGHT: It s by the tenderloin. 
DWIGHT: Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he s slouching. Okay, can you sl-slouch him into the seat.  Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt.  
CLARK: All right. 
DWIGHT: Got it? 
CLARK: Yeah yup yup. 
DWIGHT:  Get in the back. 
CLARK: What? 
DWIGHT: Get in the back. 
CLARK: Aw, come on. 
DWIGHT: Get in. 
CLARK: Damn it. 
DWIGHT: Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we re about to do? 
STANLEY: Helllloooo! 
CLARK: Okay. We, hey hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay? 
STANLEY: Pigeons. 
DWIGHT: Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson. 
CLARK: Isn t the client, like, best friends with his sister? 
DWIGHT: New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let s go. 
PAM: I m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don t want him to do it anymore, and I don t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly. 
JIM: Well, if Pam says she won t go, then  we re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph. 
NELLIE: That was exhausting. 
TOBY: Blah blah blah blah. Jim. 
NELLIE: Well, they deserve each other, then. 
TOBY: They do. That they do. 
NELLIE: That is for sure. 
TOBY:  That they do. 
DWIGHT: And for oh, whoopsie daisy.  Mrs. 
DAVIS: Stanley, what is going on here? 
DWIGHT: He s fine. He gets carsick really easily. 
CLARK: Driving. 
DWIGHT: It s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley? 
STANLEY: Ooh-hoo, look at that baby  
DWIGHT: Stanley. 
STANLEY: Ohhh  Mrs. 
DAVIS: That s Benji in the middle. 
STANLEY: That s Benji. Oh, he s precious. That s a healthy-looking baby. Mrs. 
DAVIS: Very special little boy. 
DWIGHT: Look at him. I ve never seen such a beautiful child. Mrs. 
DAVIS: Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he ll go,  eee.  
DWIGHT: Like this? Watch. 
STANLEY: Eee. 
EVERYONE:  Mrs. 
DAVIS: Like that. 
STANLEY: A beautiful family. 
DWIGHT:  Right? Come on! 
DWIGHT: Yeah, maybe I ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it s the most pleasant I ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis. 
CARLA: So, what can you do? 
ANDY:  Well, what can t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn t noticed, I ve got a pretty good British accent. 
CARLA: Can you drive a car? 
ANDY: At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here. 
CARLA: Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45? 
ANDY: My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal s going out on. 
CARLA: Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap? 
ANDY:: Yes. And yes.  
CARLA: Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kid s party, let  em throw pies at ya? 
ANDY: Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility.  I m all for it. 
CARLA: Well, Mr. Bernard, I m gonna be honest with you. 
ANDY: Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much. 
CARLA: Uh, no. We re we re gonna take you on as a client. 
ANDY: You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me. 
CARLA: We are extremely excited to be working with you too, sir. Pay Todd on your way out. 
ANDY: Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots. 
TODD: Uh, it doesn t include headshots. 
ANDY: It doesn t include headshots. 
TODD: No. 
ANDY: Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though. 
STANLEY: So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it? 
DWIGHT: You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn t even know it. I ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh.  Silly me. Gotta take the stairs. 
STANLEY: Oh, no, I m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up. 
DWIGHT: Well no, no n  
STANLEY:  
DWIGHT:  We need a winch and a hoist. 
ERIN: Oh. Hey, champions. 
TOBY: Good morning. 
CLARK: Quater finals in an hour. Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight. 
ERIN: I did. I got some really good sleep. 
CLARK: Did you?  
ERIN:  Bzzz. 
DWIGHT: Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean.  Practically made of plastic. 
NELLIE: We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill , others relied on showmanship  others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is.  And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster. 
TOBY: Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep.  
TOBY: Ow! Ow! 
PAM: I didn't see you! You should have yelled  Crossing!  
TOBY:  I'm sorry! 
PAM: Ok, so is that my spot? 
NELLIE: We are now down to an elite eight. Well, seven and Toby. 
ANDY:  Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid! 
DARRYL: It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point. 
ANDY: Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it. 
ANDY: Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt. And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two. 
TOBY: Andy? 
ANDY: Go away, we're running lines. 
TOBY: You wanted to see the gooey eye. 
ANDY: Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow.  Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go. 
TOBY: Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later. 
ANDY: Yeah, Ok.  Alright. Where were we? 
DARRYL: Something full of acid. 
ANDY: And 
REMEMBER: Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame. 
DARRYL:  That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here. 
ANDY: W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times. 
JIM: Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that. 
PAM: Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that. 
PAM: So, we had couple's therapy. 
JIM: No shame in that. Get it all out in the open. 
PAM: And we have homework. 
JIM: Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly. 
PAM: And we're also supposed to speak our truths. 
JIM: Mmhm. 
PAM: Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy. 
JIM: Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do  opportunities.  
ANDY: Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow. Carla Fern got me a gig. 
PAM: Hey! 
ANDY: Yeah. 
STANLEY: Who's Carla Fern? 
ANDY: Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator. 
OSCAR: Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you. 
ANDY: Little raw. Not cool Oscar. 
OSCAR: But you just! 
ANDY: Not cool. 
NELLIE: Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds. 
ROBERT: Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh? 
DWIGHT: I'm pumped! 
ERIN: Clark's a dead man. 
ROBERT: Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this.  
ANGELA: Oh my god! 
GROUP: Whoa. 
ANGELA: Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money. 
NELLIE: Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget. 
STANLEY: Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars. 
NELLIE: I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense. 
ERIN: Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously. 
NELLIE: Oh please.  
ANGELA: Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator. But my new studio apartment is just fine  for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens. 
PHILLIP:  
ANGELA: Come here, come here. Let's go. 
ANGELA: I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer. 
DWIGHT: I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent. 
CLARK: Oh, wide wings, interesting. 
ERIN: Hey. Why don't you back off?...I mean best of luck to you in the competition. 
ERIN: Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix. Carla 
FERN: Are you in that paper documentary too? 
DARRYL: Yep. Carla 
FERN: Do you need an agent? 
ANDY: No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage. 
DARRYL: I was in The Whiz in high school. 
ANDY: That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says  action.  Carla 
FERN: Hey, I made them get you a chair. All my clients sit. 
WOMAN: Can I take your picture? 
ANDY: I guess it's starting. Um, yeah. Of course. Yeah sure. Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it- 
WOMAN: We just need a picture of the top of your head in case we burn some of your hair off. 
ANDY: Got it.  
WOMAN: No, if you could just keep it down until.. 
ANDY: Sorry. 
NELLIE: OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela. 
KEVIN: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself? 
KEVIN: Uh huh. 
DWIGHT: Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane. 
KEVIN: Of course. 
NELLIE: Kevin, did you make that yourself? 
KEVIN: Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist. 
NELLIE: Oh man. 
DWIGHT: I call for a refold! 
KEVIN: No. 
ANGELA: Really?  Thank you. 
KEVIN: This is flatter. 
DWIGHT: It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane. 
NELLIE: Ok, that's enough. This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one. 
KEVIN: I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder. 
NELLIE: You have to choose one now. 
KEVIN: Fine.  
NELLIE: Angela advances. 
ERIN: Nice. 
DWIGHT:  Whoo! 
ANGELA: Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed. 
KEVIN: I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher. 
JIM: An Earl Grey tea for the lady. 
PAM: Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea. 
JIM: Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip. 
PAM: Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture. 
DIRECTOR: We are rolling and...action! 
ANDY:  This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death. 
PRODUCER: Ok, um, stop. Um, why are you smiling so much? 
ANDY: Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job. 
DIRECTOR: Ok, well maybe no smiling on this one. 
ANDY: So how do you want, how should I do it? 
DIRECTOR: I don't know, just like you're reporting the news or something. Ok? 
ANDY:  This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. 
DIRECTOR: Ok. 
ANDY: It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster. 
DIRECTOR: Who was that? 
ANDY: Tom Brokaw! 
DWIGHT: Come on Clark! 
ANGELA: Come on Clark.  
DWIGHT: Whoa! 
ERIN: Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink! 
CLARK: We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil. 
ERIN:  I can't hear what you said.  You got your slop?  
CLARK: You know what, this is completely unnecessary. You already won... 
PETE: Erin! Erin! Just stop. 
ERIN: What? 
PETE: Relax. 
NELLIE: Next up we have Dwight and Phyllis. Bob Vance, Vance 
REFRIGERATION: You can do it baby! 
ANGELA: No you can't baby!  Good luck. 
DWIGHT: Watch and learn. 
ERIN: Wow. 
GROUP: Oh! 
NELLIE: Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals. 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
ANGELA: Whoo! 
DWIGHT: Oh, Esther. 
ESTHER: Hey. 
DWIGHT: What are you-  You're here early. 
ESTHER: Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow. 
DWIGHT: I like a little feather in my nuggets.  
NELLIE: Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars. 
ERIN: Yeah! 
DIRECTOR: Ok here you have just knocked over the beaker, the chemicals splashed in your eye. 
ANDY: Which is insanely painful. 
DIRECTOR: Yeah. 
ANDY: And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain. 
DIRECTOR: That's great. So what you're gonna do then is come over here to the eye washing station and then just kinda flush out your eyes. You know, get the chemicals out. Alright? 
ANDY: So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later? 
DIRECTOR: What water special effect? 
PRODUCER: Yeah, yeah just hold your lids open with one hand and let the stream bathe your eyeballs. 
ANDY: I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I- 
DIRECTOR: Dude, we don't need you to go nude, OK? So just do the eyewash, Ok? That's all we're asking. 
ANDY: Darryl, what do I do? 
DARRYL: Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope. 
ANDY: They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene. 
DARRYL: So? 
ANDY: I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball. I've never even used an eye dropper. Production 
ASSISTANT: So Andy, so you know how to use this. You step on the pedal, water squirts in your eyes. 
ANDY: Carla! Carla! 
NELLIE: It is time for a little T & A. I give 
YOU: Toby and Angela. 
ANGELA:  Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn.  Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman? 
DWIGHT: Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything. 
ESTHER: Oh. Is she a gambler? 
DWIGHT: In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song. 
ESTHER: Hmm. That is sad. Carla 
FERN:  Andy! If you don't stick your eyes in that machine, I'm going to call every production in North Eastern Pennsylvania. You won't even make an appearance on a security camera!  
PRODUCER: What's the hold up here? 
DIRECTOR: The actor's crying. 
PRODUCER: Oh god. 
ANDY: She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't. 
DARRYL: Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One. 
ANDY: Do you believe in me? 
DARRYL: I believe I want to go home. 
DWIGHT:  Yeah! Ok! Beat that!  Whoo! Ok. 
ERIN: Dammit! Dammit, god.  Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels. 
PETE: Yeah.  Whoa! 
ERIN: Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win! 
PETE: Ok  Hey hey hey, whoa. 
ERIN: Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just... 
PAM: Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting. 
JIM: Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar. 
PAM: I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar. 
JIM: Thank you. Your mom is a treasure. 
PAM: Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-  
JIM: Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good. 
PAM: Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation.  I appreciate the sacrifice. 
JIM: Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair. 
PAM: Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth? 
JIM: I guess I will swallow my truth. 
CLARK: Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds. 
PAM: We're not high. 
PAM: I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up. 
KEVIN: The Mark 47 is ready for launch.  Less paste. 
DIRECTOR: Here we go. Rolling and... action! 
ANDY:  AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!! 
DIRECTOR: And cut. We can fix the sound in post. 
PRODUCER: Yeah. 
ANDY: I can do a better one. 
PRODUCER: That's fine, we'll move on. 
ANDY: I said I can do a better one. Darryl... 
DARRYL: Action! 
ANDY:  AHH! AHH! AHH! Carla 
FERN: Kid can act! 
ANDY: Yeah! Yeah. 
NELLIE: Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes. 
DWIGHT: After you. 
ANGELA: Thank you.  Oh god! 
NELLIE: Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight. 
DWIGHT:  Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God.  
ESTHER: We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely.  
DWIGHT: Alright. 
ANGELA: Don't you dare tank this.  
NELLIE: And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over. 
CREED: Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me. 
ANGELA:  Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely. 
ANGELA: I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok. 
JIM: I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok? 
PAM: Ok.  
PAM: Jim!  
JIM: Thanks. 
PAM: Alright, have a good trip. 
JIM: Bye. 
PAM: Bye.  
JIM: Hey!  I...  
PASTOR:  Love suffers long and is kind. It is not proud. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.  And now these three 
REMAIN: Faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  
PAM: I love you. 
JIM: I love you. 
JIM: I m taking some time off from work well, my other work because we needed it. 
PAM: It s great. 
JIM: It s great. 
PAM: The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts. 
JIM: But that doesn t matter. This does. It s the only thing that matters. We ve had some really nice days together. 
PAM: Nice morning, too. 
JIM: Beesly! Oh, my god. 
ANDY: Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent s putting me up for a furniture commercial. 
JIM: Ah, definitely blue. 
ANDY: Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what s up? Back in the small pond? 
JIM: For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin  
ANDY: Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on. 
JIM: Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can t give 100% to two things at once you know. 
ANDY: Tell me about it, you know? I ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don t know if I m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup. 
JIM: Huh. Well, you know, you can t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what s most important. That s my new thing. 
OSCAR:  Is everything ok? 
ANGELA: No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats. 
KEVIN: Wait, all of them? 
ANGELA: Two sacks  worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house. 
OSCAR: That s that s awful, Angela. I m so sorry. 
ANGELA: It s the  that lives downstairs. She s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type. 
KEVIN: I ve never met anyone like that. 
ANGELA: And they re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone. 
OSCAR: Angela, you still have your son. 
ANGELA: I guess. 
DWIGHT: Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office.  Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and  
JIM: Smasher! 
DWIGHT: Smasher? No, where d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts. 
DWIGHT: I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt. 
DWIGHT: I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided. 
JIM: Fireball! 
DWIGHT: Ah!  That s how it s done. 
JIM: That s pretty good. I feel safe. David 
WALLACE: Hey, Erin. Is Andy in? 
ERIN: Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said  is Indian  and was like,  Is Indian what?  Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way. 
ERIN: Lately, I ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic. 
ERIN: Yes, there s Andy! Andy is in. I m a good receptionist, I know he s in. 
ANDY: David Walrus, in his native habitat. David 
WALLACE: Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk? 
ANDY: Yeah. David 
WALLACE: This isn t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words,  The kind that s good for head shots.  And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it s gonna boost office morale. Now, he s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired. David 
WALLACE: Andy  
ANDY: I m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream. David 
WALLACE: Uh-huh, but  
ANDY: Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense. David 
WALLACE: So you think you ve been too focused on your job? 
ANDY: At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany. David 
WALLACE: So you you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting? 
ANDY: Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don t it just  I owe it to myself and my future fans. David 
WALLACE: Uh, well, I guess I can t stand in the way of a man s dream. And it seems like you have the gift. 
ANDY: Thank you, David. David 
WALLACE: There s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I? 
ANDY: Nope. I have made up my mind. I m really sorry. David 
WALLACE: Well, good luck. 
ANDY: Thank you. Not gonna need it. David 
WALLACE: Okay. David 
WALLACE: Well that kind of worked out. 
CREED: I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole. 
JIM: Oh, Clark. I m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back. 
CLARK: Right. Yeah. But, you know, I ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I ve earned this. I mean, you know? 
JIM: You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I m here. 
CLARK: Right. Well, I m here to sell paper. 
PAM: Wow. 
CLARK: All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And and Wallace is here today. And I don t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here? 
PAM: it s okay. You can sit in the annex. 
JIM: What? 
PAM: I ll come visit you. 
JIM: Okay. The annex it is. I ll be sitting at your desk if that s okay with you. 
CLARK: That s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete s beautiful, dead eyes. 
ANDY: Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever. 
OSCAR: I can t say we didn t see it coming. But it s a sad day when anybody is fired. We re so sorry, Andy. David 
WALLACE: Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired. 
ANDY: I wasn t fired. What are you talking about? I m fired up, yes. Guys, I m I m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous. 
PAM: Oh, Andy. 
ANDY: Yeah, so, I ll see you on the red carpet. See, that s how it works. 
PHYLLIS: Andy sings beautifully. And he s really good at dancing. He s a good speaker. But there s just something there you don t want to look at. 
JIM: Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark. 
PETE: Yeah, a little bit. 
JIM: Oh, wow. But, um Oh, I get that. 
PETE: Oh, no, no, no. No it s cool. 
JIM: I get it. 
PETE: It s cool, man. I m sure you and I will have our own thing. 
JIM: Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that. 
DARRYL: I just think you re going into this a little fast. 
ANDY: I m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go? 
DARRYL: Show business is cold. Let s say you get a job, which you probably won t. They re not gonna cut you any slack. You re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack. 
ANDY: All right. I get it. 
ANDY: The male is a funny species. We don t just tell each other how we feel, that s chick stuff. So instead of saying,  Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don t want you to leave.  You say something like,  Hey, Andy, you re making the worst mistake of your life. You re not talented.  Well  right back at you, Darryl. 
ANDY:  I m gonna miss you too. Mmm! 
STANLEY: Andy s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack? 
KEVIN: Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don t know. You know who s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can t fly right. I d pay to see him. But I don t have to cause the park is free! 
SENSEI: I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts. 
DWIGHT: He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts! 
SENSEI: It s not a large room, I think they heard me. 
DWIGHT: Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself.  
SENSEI: That s really ok. I m mostly focused on the belt here. 
DWIGHT: Just slip it off my Slip it off my hips. 
SENSEI: Hold it Take a step back. Take a step back.  Okay, okay. I can t I can t do this if you re gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we re gonna have to cut this off. 
DWIGHT: He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt. 
ANGELA: Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying. 
DWIGHT: There it is.  
SENSEI: Congratulations. 
DWIGHT: We did it, we did it. I love you. 
SENSEI: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You re gonna watch me right? 
SENSEI: Yes, I will.  
DWIGHT: Sensei, you re not watching. 
SENSEI: Yeah, I m watching. Just do it. 
DWIGHT: Watching? 
SENSEI: I m watching. 
DWIGHT: Watch this part, okay? David 
WALLACE: Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this? 
SENSEI: Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world. David 
WALLACE: He said that? He s an odd guy, isn t he? 
SENSEI: Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he s one of the most tenacious and determined men I ve ever met.  
ESTHER: Oh! I m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue. 
JIM: I really felt like I almost lost her, and and nothing is worth that. David 
WALLACE: Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals. 
CLARK: Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam. 
DWIGHT: You did not just say that! You don t know Pam. She is really cool. 
CLARK: All I m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager s chair. And I thought you wanted that job. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I d be happy to see Jim as manager. David 
WALLACE: So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on. 
JIM: Again. David 
WALLACE: Again! And I m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy? 
JIM: Not at all. It should be Dwight. David 
WALLACE: You sure? 
JIM: You re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh  David 
WALLACE: Yeah. 
JIM: Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don t want to meet that person. 
NELLIE: Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word. 
ANDY: It s now or never. 
NELLIE: Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive. 
ANDY: Yeah, sure. What s your question? 
KEVIN: Our question is it seems dumb. 
ANDY: Well, it s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right? 
NELLIE: Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and  full-ass  it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm? 
ANDY: Nah. I like my plan better. 
KEVIN: Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You re too character-y to be a lead and you re not fat enough to be a great character actor. 
ANDY: What? 
OSCAR: No, I don t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it? 
JIM: Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies? 
PAM: Yes. Yeah. 
JIM: I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens. 
PAM: Oh, boy. Um  
JIM: If you could help me out, that would be  
PAM: I could give you some beginner stickies? 
JIM: Anything would help. 
PAM: Here you go. 
JIM: Oh, also, while you re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Wow, that s  
PAM: It s all yours. 
JIM: You come so prepared. Aspirin. 
DWIGHT: You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that. 
JIM: Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It s really great. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager s job? 
JIM: No. He was maybe thinking of you for it. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, right. I m afraid that ship has sailed. 
JIM: I wouldn t be too sure about that. Just saying. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
ANDY: Well, hello. 
DWIGHT: Big day for you. 
ANDY: Big day for you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
ANDY: Love the belt. 
DWIGHT: Oh, yes. 
ANDY: You know, I don t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog s outta here, so letting it all hang out! 
DWIGHT: This is exciting! You re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings. 
ANDY: Thank you, I appreciate that.  Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it. 
DWIGHT: Oh, I doubt you ll make it. Very few do who ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right? 
ANDY: No, I just applied for more overdraft protection. 
DWIGHT: Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don t quit your day job. 
ANDY:  Nothing is impossible to him who will try.  Alexander the Great, if he were cockney. 
DWIGHT: You re bad. 
ANDY: I m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person. 
ANDY: Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That s something you can t take back. 
ERIN: So true. Is there a question, or are what? 
ANDY: Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor? 
ERIN: Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve. 
ANDY: Thank you.  David 
WALLACE: You can stay on as a salesman, Andy. 
ANDY: Thank you.  David 
WALLACE: Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please? 
DWIGHT: Say it again. David 
WALLACE: Will you be the new manager? 
DWIGHT: Where? David 
WALLACE: Where? 
DWIGHT: What branch? David 
WALLACE: Here. Scranton.  Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let s go. It s good news. 
DWIGHT: I m sorry. I ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun. David 
WALLACE: What? 
DWIGHT: But this isn t interim manager. No. It s Dwight K. Schrute   Manager. David 
WALLACE: Why do you already have this? 
DWIGHT: In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David. David 
WALLACE: I know. 
DWIGHT: I will never, ever let you down. David 
WALLACE: I know, Dwight. I know.  Okay. Okay. All righty. You re gonna do great. 
PAM: Hey. 
JIM: Wow, hey. 
PAM: Hi. 
JIM: What s up? 
PAM: Um, I have a question. 
JIM: Okay. 
PAM: Oh, I had a question. 
JIM: Really? 
PAM: I did! 
JIM: Yeah, totally you did. 
PAM: Super important. 
JIM: I need you to stay right here while you think about it. 
PAM: Okay. 
JIM: All right? I m gonna wait. 
PAM: All right. I did not come back here just to see you. 
JIM: I m sure you did not. What was your question? 
PAM: I don t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out. 
JIM: Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I m waiting. 
PAM: Exactly. 
ANDY: Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I m gonna stay on in sales. 
NELLIE: Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet. 
MEREDITH: Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don t want to see you in a porn next year. 
ANDY: Okay. 
KEVIN: Ooh, there s a great play about a salesman. 
ANDY: Death of a salesman. 
KEVIN: I don t think so. 
ANDY: Sure,  Death of a Salesman  by Arthur Miller, it s a great play about crushed dreams. 
KEVIN: No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants. 
ANDY:  Got any hot leads? 
PETE: See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward. 
ERIN: I had no idea. And here I ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin  sheep. 
JIM: Look who s back. 
PAM: I m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it s like a double date. 
PETE: Wow. Cause, uh  
ERIN: Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That d be fun. 
PAM: Yeah, we should do that for real sometime. 
ERIN: Well, how about Thursday? 
PAM: Oh, well, Thursday s tough, because of  
JIM: Weeknights are actually tough just because  
PAM: They are. 
JIM: That s true, yeah. 
ERIN: Just forget it. Forget I said anything. David 
WALLACE: Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute  
DWIGHT: David. Can I just do one thing while you re making this announcement and then I ll never, ever do it again? David 
WALLACE: I don t think so. 
DWIGHT: It s just one thing. Just let me let me do this  David 
WALLACE: Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on what I was about to say was Dwight  Oh, I m sorry, I gotta This ll be a second, sorry. 
DWIGHT: Just wait and send it to voicemail. David 
WALLACE: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Come on. Come on. David 
WALLACE:  Then we ll get him a new set of drums. 
DWIGHT:  Dwight Schrute is manager!  
ANDY: Brava, brava. 
CREED:  Creed Bratton is the new manager!  
PAM: What s going on? 
KEVIN: Dwight s the new manager. He freaking did it. 
PAM:  Congratulations, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Pam. 
JIM:  Congratulations, buddy. 
DWIGHT: Thank you, Jim. 
CLARK: Congrats, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Get out of Jim s seat. 
CLARK: But I fought for this seat. 
DWIGHT: You re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram. 
PAM: It s nice to have you back. 
DWIGHT: So  
JIM: So. 
DWIGHT: I wanted to offer you a new position. 
JIM: Let s hear it. 
DWIGHT: Assistant regional manager. 
JIM: Nope. Can t accept that job. It s not a real job. 
DWIGHT: Jim. 
JIM: I ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I d be proud to take. 
DWIGHT: Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot. 
JIM: Don t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus. 
DWIGHT: So, all the numbers adding up? 
OSCAR: Hey, I didn t get a chance to say it, but  congratulations, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Yes. Congratulations. 
KEVIN: Yeah, and Dwight, I d like to be the first to say congratulations. 
ANGELA: This is a big day for you. 
DWIGHT: Yes, it is. Carry on. 
ANDY: How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It s cause I had a fallback. That s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself. 
ANDY: Everyone! Changed my mind again. 
PHYLLIS: What s it now, dream or no dream? 
ANDY: Uh, dream. Goin  with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn t that right, Jim? 
JIM: Oh, don t look at me cause I think you re making a terrible choice. 
ANDY: All in! Whoo! 
ANDY: Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all. 
TOBY: Okay, then, Andy. 
ANDY: Yeah, but here s the thing. I can t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners. 
TOBY: Andy, you know I can t do that. It d be lying. 
ANDY: Seriously? 
TOBY: Yeah, I m  
ANDY: Come on, just do it. 
TOBY: I can t. 
ANDY: All right, fine, just know that you made me do this.  
TOBY:  Oh, come on. Andy, no. 
ANDY: God, Toby, don t stop blocking my hand. 
TOBY: No, no. 
ANDY: This is your you brought this on. 
TOBY: No, no. Andy. 
ANDY: Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood! 
ANGELA:  This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there s a problem it s clearly on your end. And oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um  what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting!  
KEVIN: What do you think that was about? 
ANDY: David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite. David 
WALLACE: We put the past behind us, though, Andy. 
ANDY: What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company? David 
WALLACE: Enough, Andy. Enough! 
ANDY: Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car? David 
WALLACE: Oh my god. 
ANDY: Eleanor Roosevelt once said  the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.   I think she s right.  I feel calm now.  I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I m doing the right thing. 
ANGELA: Andy. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANGELA: What are you doing? 
ANDY: Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don t squash my knickety-knacks on top. 
ANGELA: Yeah, okay. That s not what I mean. You don t have to leave because you said you would. Don t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It s not worth it. 
ANDY: Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too  
ANGELA: Ugh. 
ANDY: But I just it s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn t  
ANGELA: No, that s not  
ANDY: Rehash  
ANGELA: No, none No, stop. It s just  
ANDY: Exactly. 
ANGELA: Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy. 
ANDY: Thanks, Angela. You too. 
ANGELA: Thanks. 
ANDY: A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how. 
NELLIE: Oh, good lord. 
STANLEY: Can t you just leave? 
JIM: You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye. 
ANDY: Tuna, I m a performer. And perform I shall.  
DWIGHT:  You okay? 
ANGELA:  It s just a really nice song. 
KEVIN:  Awesome! 
PHYLLIS: Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He s not terrible. 
STANLEY: Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo. 
PHYLLIS: No, he s good. 
STANLEY: He was good. 
OSCAR: Good night, Kevin. 
KEVIN: Night, Oscar. 
OSCAR: Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar. 
ANGELA: Well, I ve changed my mind. 
OSCAR: Wait a minute. You re not thinking of living in a  
ANGELA: Oh, god, could you just mind your own business? 
OSCAR: Okay, I m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent. 
ANGELA: Oh, god. 
OSCAR: Come stay with me. 
ANGELA: You don t want me at your place. 
OSCAR: I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won t be long. It s the least I could do. 
ANGELA: Well  
OSCAR: Separate bathrooms. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
OSCAR: You re welcome. Let s go get Phillip. Then we ll get your stuff  
ANGELA: Okay. 
OSCAR: And get you the hell outta that place. 
ANGELA: Are you allowed to have pets? 
OSCAR: Oh, Angela. 
DWIGHT: Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day. 
DARRYL: You talk to Wade and Colin? 
JIM: No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What s up? 
DARRYL: We got an offer on the table. 
JIM: What kind of offer? 
DARRYL: A buyout. 
JIM: What? 
DARRYL: We re in play, baby. 
JIM: Oh, my god! 
DARRYL: We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it s not just a Philly play, so get 
THIS: they re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby. 
JIM: Wow, that is  wow. 
DARRYL: Yeah, we did it. 
JIM: Yeah, we did. Hey, how long how long do we think that s gonna take? 
DARRYL: Wade said we could do the whole country in three months. 
JIM: Oh, man. Yeah, I can t do it. 
DARRYL: Can t do what? 
JIM: This, man. I can t do this to Pam. 
DARRYL: No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything. 
JIM: I know. And I can t do it. 
ANGELA: So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross? 
OSCAR: No, it s neat and tasteful, like most gay men s homes. The stereotype holds up. 
ANGELA: I wouldn t know. I never lived with a gay guy. 
OSCAR: Angela, you just were  
ANGELA:  I love him. 
OSCAR: I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You you can t  
ANGELA: No, not the senator. I love Dwight. 
ERIN: The tea in Nepal is very hot. 
KEVIN: But the coffee in Peru is much hotter.  
DWIGHT: Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first 
PROJECT: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they re protecting America s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day s security codes. Something that s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It s not the KGB, but it s a start. 
ERIN: The tea in Nepal is very hot. 
DWIGHT: But the coffee in Peru is far hotter. 
ERIN: Close. 
DWIGHT: This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter? 
ERIN: Colder. 
DWIGHT: The coffee in Paraguay is colder? 
ERIN: No, I meant you re getting colder. The correct response is,  the coffee in Peru is much hotter.  
DWIGHT: Ah, much, ok. 
ERIN: But, that s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam.  Unless you want me to break protocol? 
DWIGHT: No, no. Give me the steam. 
DWIGHT: It s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd. 
DWIGHT:  Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol! 
CREED:  Oh, I m saving a fortune on dry cleaning. 
PHILIP: Mama! 
OSCAR: Angela, someone wants you. 
ANGELA: Ok, coming. Hi, baby. 
OSCAR: Angela s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it s Angela who s living in the closet. Hey-o. 
OSCAR: Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services. 
ESTHER: Go get  em, honey. 
DWIGHT: Oh, don t worry. They ll get got. 
DWIGHT: Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check  on that later today. This is my grandmother s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother s buttock bullet ring. 
ANDY: Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick. Check-in 
GUY: Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line. 
ANDY: Yes! 
ANDY: Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It s a really cool show, it s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean! 
JIM: Sales form for you to sign. 
DWIGHT: You know what to do.  Ok 
DWIGHT: Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best. 
JIM: Aw, thanks, man. 
DWIGHT: Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War  
JIM: No. 
DWIGHT: Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office. 
JIM: Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well. 
PAM: Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting. 
JIM: All depends on the conference room meeting itself.  Uh, okay. 
PAM: Is that them again? 
JIM: Yeah. 
PAM: Maybe you should call back? 
JIM: I will. I will. 
JIM: The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I m not risking that again. 
PAM: When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim. 
DWIGHT: Welcome. 
JIM: He welcomes you. 
DWIGHT: Please take an agenda item. 
JIM: Your agenda-taking pleases him. 
DWIGHT: Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote.  Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.   That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you. 
JIM: Let s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you re expecting a fax today, please don t yell out,  Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.  Ok? That s nonsense. 
PAM: Question. 
JIM: Yes, beautiful girl in the front. 
PAM: We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out,  Nice jugs ? 
JIM: That s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office? 
EVERYONE:  Zero. No nonsense. You can t have nonsense. 
DWIGHT:  What is going on? 
ANGELA: Daycare won t take Phillip anymore. 
OSCAR: Why? 
ANGELA: Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won t forgive. So, hi. 
OSCAR: Hi, buddy. 
DWIGHT: Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today. 
JIM: Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who s excited? 
MEREDITH: I d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn t for the cameras, I would ve done some truly vulgar crap. 
STANLEY: Over the course of this documentary I ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some 
TROUBLE: my wife did it. 
DWIGHT: I m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month. 
KEVIN: Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions. 
OSCAR: I can t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe. 
CREED: This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast. 
ANDY: This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang  I Dreamed a Dream  from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic. 
CASEY: Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio!  Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you. 
ANDY: No! 
CASEY: America wants it! 
ANDY: No, this is my time! You don t belt on my time! I belt on my time. 
CASEY:  Casey Dean! 
ANDY:  Casey Dean! 
CASEY: Man, those are some nice pipes. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
CASEY: What s your name? 
ANDY: Andy. What s yours? 
ANGELA: Why didn t you pack the apple snacks? 
OSCAR: Why didn t you pack the apple snacks? 
KEVIN: Guys. 
ANGELA: Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong. 
KEVIN: Guys. 
ANGELA: Why don t you pack it? 
KEVIN: Guys. Angela & 
OSCAR: Kevin, what? 
KEVIN: Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says  bold front  instead of  cold front ? It s insane. 
ANGELA: Not now, Kevin. Can t you see we re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks. 
OSCAR: Seriously, Kevin. I m just gonna have to go to the store. 
ANGELA: Ok, you go to the store. 
KEVIN: Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip. 
DWIGHT: Not now! Private time! 
JIM: I love Star Wars as much as the next guy  
DWIGHT: Hey, hey! Seriously?  
JIM: My god, I m so sorry. Well this might make up for 
IT: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN. 
DWIGHT: Which is, of course  
JIM: Potential future nonsense. 
DWIGHT: Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me. 
JIM: I m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You ve got a regional manager. 
DWIGHT: The power source. 
JIM: Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager. 
DWIGHT: A loyal, but bungling apostle. 
JIM: But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager? 
DWIGHT: Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore. 
JIM: Exactly. 
DWIGHT: I d have to get some more wire and string, but it s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable? 
JIM: Yeah, right. I mean, unless they re willing to pass some tests. 
DWIGHT: I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind? 
JIM: Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table? 
DWIGHT: That doesn t sound crazy, Jim. That s the sanest thing I ve ever heard. 
CASEY: What re you listening to? 
ANDY: Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440. 
CASEY: Oh, sweet. 
ANDY: A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch. Mark 
MCGRATH: What s up, everybody? And welcome to America s Next A Cappella Singing Sensation! 
CASEY: Ah! It s Mark McGrath! Oh my god! You re gorgeous! Mark 
MCGRATH: Thank you, thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for thirty seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers, which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole! 
ANDY: There s a mole? Mark 
MCGRATH: Oops. I m not supposed to I m not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right? 
ANDY: What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it. Mark 
MCGRATH: Good man right there. I ll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right? 
ANDY: Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me! 
CASEY: What? On a roll much? 
ANDY: I don t know where it came from. 
CASEY: That was amazing, man! 
ANDY: Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny. 
CASEY: Yeah, you made a personal connection with him. 
ANDY: I did, I felt it. 
CASEY: Big time. 
PAM: What are you so excited about? 
JIM: Nothing. 
PAM: What are you up to? 
JIM: Members of the office, hear ye. 
DWIGHT: That means ye, Plop! 
PETE: Plop? Still? 
DWIGHT: We owe Andy that much. Am I right people? 
PETE: Fine. 
JIM: Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager. 
ERIN: Aw, heck ya! 
PAM: Nice. 
DWIGHT: You ll always have the upper hand, when you ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending. 
JIM: This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that s for fueling only. No savoring. 
DWIGHT: Wow, the honor. God, I envy them. 
JIM: He envies you. 
DWIGHT: You don t need to repeat right now, when I m saying it. 
JIM: Alright. 
JIM: By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me. 
DARRYL: What up? 
GLENN: What s going on? How was the delivery? 
DARRYL: Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I m here. 
DARRYL: I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all. 
JIM: A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now? 
MEREDITH: Uh, two. 
JIM: 985,000,000,000,017. 
DWIGHT: Not even close, Meredith. Come on! 
JIM: Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now? 
PAM: Theme song from Saved by the Bell. 
JIM: Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World. 
DWIGHT: Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other s minds. You re trying to give your wife this job. 
JIM: That s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing? 
PETE: A horse. 
JIM: Ew, the exact opposite, actually. 
PETE: What s the opposite of a horse? 
JIM: Come on. Jim & 
DWIGHT: Sea horse. 
JIM: Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna  Jim & 
DWIGHT: Say that? Uncanny. 
JIM: Challenge number two, protocol. Clark? 
CLARK: Yeah. 
JIM: Do you want a corn dog? 
CLARK: I would love a corn dog. 
JIM: We ll see. You are an assistant who s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message. 
CLARK:  Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.  
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no! You don t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don t have diplomatic relations. 
JIM: Uncanny. 
SOLDIER: I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they ll feel like anything is possible. 
ANDY: Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you. 
CASEY: Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids. 
ANDY: What? 
CASEY: Yeah. 
ANDY: Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing? 
CASEY: I don t know. But I m getting really worried here. 
ANDY: Me too. Hold my place in line. 
CASEY: Where are you going? 
ANDY: They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me. 
DARRYL: Thanks, man. 
HANK: Thank you. 
DARRYL: Yep. Take care. 
PAM: Darryl, hey. 
DARRYL: Hey. 
PAM: Cool, are you coming back to say hi? 
DARRYL: No, no, I m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn t say goodbye to. 
PAM: Aha. How s Athlead? 
DARRYL: We livin  like rock stars. I m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities. 
PAM: Wow. 
DARRYL: Jim really doesn t want to come? 
PAM: He says he doesn t want to. 
DARRYL: Wow. Man. I hope he doesn t regret it. 
PAM: Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin. 
DARRYL: Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin? 
PAM: That s what he says. 
DARRYL: If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then. 
JIM: An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right? 
DWIGHT: A thousand times more. 
PHYLLIS: I ll try this one. 
JIM: Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course. 
PHYLLIS:  Hot! 
JIM: Yeah. It s real. It s the only way you ll learn. OK, and go ahead.  Oh, god, nice! She s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful! 
DWIGHT:  No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously? 
JIM: Look at that form. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee!  Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah! 
JIM: Uncanny.  
ERIN: Darryl?! Darryl! 
KEVIN: Whoa. 
DARRYL: Oh, hey. Hey, what s up, y all? 
ERIN: You left us without saying goodbye. 
DARRYL: Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody. 
MEREDITH: Hey! No way! 
KEVIN: That s totally uncool. 
ERIN: Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs. 
DARRYL: I don t think I sh- 
ERIN: Get upstairs, mister! 
MEREDITH: Yeah! 
KEVIN: Right. Now. 
DARRYL: Guess I m going upstairs. 
JIM: You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing none of these people are good enough. 
DWIGHT: I know. 
JIM: What I m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I ve ever said. 
DWIGHT: Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant- 
JIM: Is- 
DWIGHT: Me. 
JIM: The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute. 
DWIGHT: Yes!  Thank you. 
JIM: I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one.  That s it. You look really, really good. 
DWIGHT: Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right? 
JIM: Hey. 
PAM: Hey. 
JIM: You all right? What s going on? 
PAM: Are you happy? 
JIM: Yes, I m happy. 
PAM: No, I know that you re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today. 
JIM: Yeah. 
PAM: And that was fun. But what about a year from now? 
JIM: What? 
PAM: What about five years from now? 
JIM: Pam. 
PAM: Because I m so glad you re back, baby, but I m just I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you re giving up so much. 
JIM: This was my decision, not yours. 
PAM: Okay. 
JIM: You didn t force me. 
PAM: I kind of forced you to do it. 
JIM: You did not force me to do this. 
PAM: Yes, I did. 
JIM: I don t know how else to tell you. 
PAM: I m afraid that you re gonna resent me and I m afraid that  
JIM: Resent you? 
PAM: This is not enough for you and I m afraid that I m not enough for you. 
JIM: Is that really what you think? 
JIM: Not enough? I don t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it s against the rules but I m gonna need a favor from you guys. Camera 
CREW: Okay. You got it, man. 
DARRYL: I didn t realize we were this close. 
PHYLLIS: We re all a little hormonal with the doc airing. 
MEREDITH: Are you gonna come to Poor Richard s and watch with us tonight? 
DARRYL: Uh  yeah. Depending on traffic. 
STANLEY: He ain t coming. 
ERIN: Oh, god! 
DARRYL: These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck. 
DARRYL: Well, it s been great. 
PHYLLIS: Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he s gone for who knows how long. 
DARRYL: Maybe forever. Anyhow  
OSCAR: Did we ever have lunch together, just just the two of us? You know what, I m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino s. 
MEREDITH: Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van? 
DARRYL: Oh, oh, I m sure we did. 
MEREDITH: Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl. 
CLARK: Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get. 
ERIN: Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we ll get this started. 
DARRYL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that s on me. But I m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you re feeling sentimental. 
MEREDITH: You have to!  
DARRYL: Hey, hey, hey. I ll do one thing with y all. 
PHYLLIS: Which thing? 
DARRYL: I don t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though. 
ANGELA: Kevin, Kevin. 
KEVIN: Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking.  
ANGELA: Kevin, could you not do that? 
KEVIN: What? I m moving the ink down in my pen, for work. 
OSCAR: Here, use my pen. 
KEVIN: Don t tell me what to do! Angela & 
OSCAR: Shhh! 
KEVIN: No, I don t need this! And you obviously don t need me. 
ANGELA: Kevin, where are you going? 
KEVIN: Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true. 
OSCAR: He just won t go down. It s as if he s excited by all this paper. 
ANGELA: I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond. 
DWIGHT: Smart baby. That s the most flavorful bond. 
ANDY: Hey, what s goin  on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young uns? 
CASEY: You re back! 
ANDY: No, it s me, Andy! 
CASEY: No, I know. 
ANDY: No, no, no. I m wearing makeup. 
CASEY: You did a really great job. You even look shorter. 
ANDY: Oh, I took out my lifts. 
CASEY: Oh. 
ANDY: Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height. 
CASEY: Oh. 
ESTHER: All day long, it s moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs. 
DWIGHT: Oink the pigs, that is very important.  
ESTHER: Dwight, I m telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight? 
DWIGHT: The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you, Esther. 
ESTHER: Bye.  
JIM: You threw the summoning bag at me, sir? 
DWIGHT: I need you to perform a test. 
JIM: Perform a test. 
DWIGHT: On an innocent baby. 
JIM: Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don t worry, he s the best in the biz. 
DWIGHT: Damn straight. 
JIM: Unless you think he can t handle it. 
DWIGHT: Hey, he can handle it. 
JIM: All right. 
OSCAR:  Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley s sleeping. You don t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you? 
STANLEY: I heard that. 
PHILLIP: Mama. 
DWIGHT: Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps. 
PAM: He does have a gift. 
OSCAR: Well, he s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites. 
PHILLIP: Mama. 
DWIGHT: Okay.  You ever been in a manager s office before? 
DWIGHT: Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It s called  Schrute or Consequences.  You re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet? 
PHILLIP: Beet. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes. Check-in 
GUY: Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions. People in 
LINE: Oh come on! Hey! 
ANDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? Check-in 
GUY: But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America s Next A Cappella Sensa  
ANDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can t do that. You can t do that, we ve all been waiting. Check-in 
GUY: Okay. 
ANDY: I am going in there! Don t  Check-in 
GUY: No, you re not, sir. 
ANDY: Don t don t  Check-in 
GUY: Please don t. 
ANDY: Don t touch me. Check-in 
GUY: I m not touching you. Okay?  
CASEY: Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don t you dare. Don t get I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I m Casey Dean! You ll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you won t be seeing the last of me! 
OSCAR: Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple. 
DWIGHT: That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast. 
KEVIN: He s not that smart. He doesn t know where I hid his duck. 
ANDY:  Hi. You re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You re like, my three favorite people ever. 
SANTIGOLD: What is this? 
ANDY:  Sweetheart, you re amazing, okay? You re obviously gonna be on the show, so it s someone else s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right,  my name is Ezra Cornell and I m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart. Aaron 
RODGERS: No, you re a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on. 
ANDY: Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that. Clay 
AIKEN: No, we do not want to hear you sing. 
SANTIGOLD: Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye. 
ANDY: Nope! Can t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern. Aaron 
RODGERS: Flag on the play. 
ANDY: That s that s what yeah. Okay, all right, well, here s the song.  Far above Cayuga s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater  
SANTIGOLD: What is this song? 
ANDY: Are you insane? It s the Cornell fight song. Clay 
AIKEN: Listen, all right, thank you very much, we re not interested. 
ANDY: You didn t let me finish. That s not fair. Aaron 
RODGERS: Look, man, you re not terrible. We ve heard a lot of really good singers today and you re just not good enough. 
ANDY: Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that s the show. Let me try a different song, okay? Aaron 
RODGERS: Can he do this? 
ANDY:  Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you re never fully dressed without a smile.  Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly  
SANTIGOLD: Look, you gotta go.  You can t just sit here and cry. 
ANDY: Oh I can so just sit here and cry! 
JIM:  Thank you. 
OSCAR: Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy? 
KEVIN: Can t hear you. I m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored? 
OSCAR: Okay, I guess, it s just that Phillip got you something. 
ANGELA: Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes. 
OSCAR: I think there s, like, $7 left. 
ANGELA: It s just his way of saying,  Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.  
KEVIN: Phillip got this for me? 
OSCAR: Sure. 
KEVIN: That was a really cool move. 
ANGELA: Would you like to hold Phillip?  Yeah. That s Kevin. 
KEVIN: Whoa. 
OSCAR: Easy. 
KEVIN: What a chubbers. Whoa. 
ANGELA: Okay, watch it. 
KEVIN: I m losing my balance. 
ANGELA: No, Kevin, no. 
OSCAR: Hey, no. 
KEVIN: Whoa! 
OSCAR: No horseplay. 
ANGELA: Stop it. 
KEVIN: You wanna play with the cactus? 
ANGELA: No, no! 
KEVIN: So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we re gonna be best friends. He s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you. 
ERIN: We have our decision. 
DARRYL: You chose one thing? 
ERIN: We want to dance with you. 
DARRYL: You want to dance? 
ERIN: One dance, all of us together. 
DARRYL: This is what you want? 
ERIN: Absolutely. 
DARRYL: Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we re gonna do this right. 
ERIN: Yes!  
ANGELA: Hey. You wanted to see me? 
DWIGHT: Door. Chair. It s about Phillip. 
ANGELA: I am sorry he s here today but I had  
DWIGHT: I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal. 
ANGELA: How thoughtful. 
DWIGHT: Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man s closet. 
ANGELA: If he is your son, that s a great plan. But he s not. He s not your son. 
DWIGHT: Very well. 
ANGELA: Can I go back to my desk now? 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
PAM: What is this? 
JIM: Well I ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn t believe me, so  I needed a little help. 
DWIGHT: Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red. 
JIM: OK, I don t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so. 
DWIGHT:  Now. 
JIM: I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip. 
DWIGHT: Jim. I m not kidding. I need you. 
PAM: Go ahead. 
JIM: Ok, um, this is   I ll be right back. 
JIM: What do we got? 
DWIGHT: I was thinking of proposing to Esther today. 
JIM: Wow! Congratulations, that s a really big step. 
DWIGHT: She s got a ton of great qualities. She s young, she s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn t technically incest. 
JIM: Right in the sweet spot. I think you re gonna be really happy. 
DWIGHT: Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm. 
JIM:  That s a lot of pros. 
DWIGHT: And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up. 
JIM: So what is the problem? 
DWIGHT: Angela.  
JIM: I don t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I ve been faced with a tough decision, there s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation. 
DWIGHT: Some sort of virus? 
JIM: Love. 
DWIGHT: Oh.  
JIM: Dwight, 
LISTEN: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have. 
DWIGHT: You re a good assistant, Jim. 
JIM: Not as good as you. 
DWIGHT: That s very true. Get the hell outta here. 
JIM: You got it.  
JIM: You watched it. 
PAM: Yeah. 
JIM: Well, then I guess you re ready for this.  
PAM: What s that? 
JIM: It s from the teapot. Everything you ll ever need to know is in that note.  Not enough for me? You are everything. 
PAM: Thank you. 
ERIN: Ok, everybody ready? 
PHYLLIS: Hit it, red!  
DARRYL: I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I m gonna miss these guys. 
OSCAR: Ok, I ve got my  
MEREDITH: See you guys at Poor Richard s, all right? 
OSCAR: All right, Meredith. 
ANGELA: Okay, bye. 
OSCAR: See you there. 
KEVIN: Bye, Phillip. High five. 
OSCAR: Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother s, and I ll meet you at Poor Richard s in an hour. 
ANGELA: Are you sure you don t want me to drop him off? 
OSCAR: She doesn t know I m living with a straight woman. I don t want to get her hopes up. 
ANGELA: All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye! 
OSCAR: Oh, my goodness. 
DWIGHT:  Pull over! 
ANGELA: Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Move to the side of the road! 
ANGELA: Why? 
DWIGHT: Pull over! 
ANGELA: What do you Dwight!  
ANGELA:  Dwight! What the  is your problem! 
DWIGHT:  Shut up, woman! 
ANGELA: Who drives like that? 
DWIGHT: Listen to me! I love you! And I don t care that Phillip s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you! 
ANGELA: Can you put that down? 
DWIGHT: This expresses how loudly I love you. 
ANGELA: It s too loud. 
DWIGHT:  This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites. 
ANGELA: Okay, yes yes, I will!  I love you! 
DWIGHT: I love you! 
ANGELA: And I lied to you. 
DWIGHT: What? 
ANGELA: Phillip s your son. 
DWIGHT: What? Why would you say that  
ANGELA: I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me. 
DWIGHT:  Get out! I m a dad! 
ANGELA: You re a dad! 
CREED: Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can.  Oh! 
ERIN: You have to change the channel to PBS. 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
BARTENDER: College baseball is on. 
ERIN: But there s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it. 
BARTENDER: What s it about? 
ERIN: A paper company. 
BARTENDER: How many people want the game?  Who wants PBS?  Sorry. Tie means I do nothing. 
KEVIN: Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places. 
ANDY: One more for the doc.  
BARTENDER: All right. 
KEVIN: Yes! 
CLARK: Hey, how was the singing show audition? 
ANDY: Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal. 
CREED: Ok, thirty seconds to showtime! 
KEVIN: I feel scared a little. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I m not ready for this. 
STANLEY: No one is ready for this. You can t be ready for this. We don t even know what this is. 
OSCAR: One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same. 
JIM: Here we go.  
DWIGHT: The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew? Camera 
MAN: We re getting bonus footage for the DVD. 
DWIGHT: pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore. Camera 
MAN: It ll be a pledge gift. 
DWIGHT: PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you. 
DWIGHT: In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there s a mini-reunion. A kind of a  where are they now  panel at a local theatre. It ll be nice to see everyone again.  I haven t seen Kevin since we let him go. 
DWIGHT:  Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring. 
KEVIN: Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo! 
STANLEY: Ah, I ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old. 
MEREDITH: Speech! 
DWIGHT: No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is for Kevin. 
KEVIN: Yes! Wait, why? 
DWIGHT: Go ahead and just read the frosting. 
KEVIN:  Get out.  
DWIGHT: Uh-huh. 
KEVIN: What does that mean? 
DWIGHT: It s a colloquial way of saying  you re fired,  Kevin, which you are. 
PAM: What? Dwight, you can t do that. 
DWIGHT: The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry. 
ALL: What?! 
DWIGHT: Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying. 
ALL: Dwight  
DWIGHT: Based on his merit. 
OSCAR: Ooh. 
JIM: Umm . 
KEVIN: I m good. 
PAM: Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone s ever been fired, Toby s blocked it, so  
TOBY: Yeah. Yeah, I don t think  
DWIGHT: Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here s your cake.  Bye, bye Toby. 
KEVIN:  At least I got chocolate. 
JIM: I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it s good for the environment too. 
JIM: Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center. 
CROWD: Whoo! Yeah 
JIM:  Can you clap! Can you clap for mom? 
JIM: And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese. 
PAM:  Angela, are you ready for the wedding? 
ANGELA:  Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace.  Look at Meredith. She s disgusting. Those feet. They re like the paws of an orangutan. 
PAM: I think she looks good. Now that she s wearing sports bras, we don t see her boobs as much. 
DWIGHT: That is all. Have a good morning. 
MEREDITH: Thank you. 
DWIGHT:  What was that for? 
ANGELA:  To remind you that our wedding s gonna be wonderful. 
DWIGHT: Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone. 
ANGELA: D, it s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me. 
DWIGHT: Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he s been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him. 
ANGELA: I don t I don t know why. 
DWIGHT: I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band  The Grass Roots  in the 1960 s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, some fudge? 
MALCOLM: Oh, thanks. I love your fudge. 
PHYLLIS: Thanks. 
MALCOLM: I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here. 
PHYLLIS:  Oh, you can afford it. 
PHYLLIS: After 16 years, it s strange sitting across from somebody who isn t Stanley. But he ll get there. 
JIM: Okay, the limo s gonna be here at five. I need everybody to be ready  cause I want to pack in a lot. 
ZEKE: Party time! Whorehouse! 
JIM: Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight s night, okay? 
ZEKE: Well, you re the bestisch mensch. 
JIM: Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight only good surprises.  Guten Pranken .  
DWIGHT: Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won t be necessary tonight. 
CLARK: Great, now we got three hours to fill. 
JIM: Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn t going to show up? 
DWIGHT: Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing. 
JIM: Mose has been weird? That s so unlike him. 
ANDY: Yeah, sure, I ll talk about it. Why not? American s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say  Casey 
DEAN: You can t just sit here and cry. 
ANDY: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry! 
ANDY: Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.  Bill 
HADER:  Seth 
MAYERS: Oh, Don t. Aw, come on, Baby Wawa. Don t be such a baby. Bill 
HADER:  Seth 
MAYERS: Oh, No. It s gonna be alright. Bill 
HADER:  Seth 
MAYERS: It s gonna be all right. For Weekend Update I m Seth Meyers. That s Baby Wawa. Good night. Bill 
HADER:  Bye! 
ANDY: After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group.  Not really my scene. 
OSCAR:  Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you hold on. 
DAKOTA: Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It s..it s all over the place. I don t know what it means. 
OSCAR: That s the reason Kevin got fired. It s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight,   A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.  He was home by 4:45 that day. 
NELLIE: Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone. 
TOBY: Hello!  Hello! 
NELLIE: Oh. 
TOBY: Hi!  
NELLIE: No. 
TOBY: Oh.  
NELLIE: How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me? 
TOBY: Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr? 
NELLIE: No. And I thought I unfriended you. 
TOBY: Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab? 
TOBY:  That s Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God! 
JIM: Hey man, good to see you. 
ANDY: Thank you. Yeah, 
PHYLLIS: . Andy  
ANDY: Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly. 
PHYLLIS: Andy, I ve been worried about you. How are you? 
ANDY: A little warm. 
PHYLLIS: Poor, poor Andy. 
ANDY:  Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis. 
DARRYL: Hello, hello. 
JIM: Hey! 
MEREDITH: Darryl! 
ANDY: Hey! 
DARRYL: Hey, what s up? 
ANDY: Didn t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo? 
DARRYL: What? Must ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual. 
ANDY: Hmm. 
DARRYL: Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um I didn t call  cause I figured you changed the number. 
ANDY: No I didn t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings. 
DWIGHT: What? Ooh! 
ANDY: Surprise! 
DWIGHT: I thought you guys couldn t come. 
DARRYL: Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet. 
JIM: Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I?  Guten Prank  number one. 
DARRYL: You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town? 
DWIGHT: Uh, better ask Jim. 
JIM: And Jim will say nothing. 
PAM:  Darryl! Andy! 
ANDY: Hey! Pam! 
DARRYL: Hey, Pam! How are you? 
PAM: We re fine. Yeah.  And I m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn t you be? 
ANDY: Mm-hmm. 
PAM: Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time. 
DARRYL: I love it. And it s Athleap now. And the city is amazing. 
JIM: Yeah? 
DARRYL: Yeah. Yeah, it s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are for real. 
JIM: Wow! That sounds incredible. . Oh, guys. Limo s here. Let s do this. Change if you need to. 
OSCAR: Whoo, whoo, whoo. 
PAM: Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy. 
OSCAR: Yeah! 
ANDY: Aw! 
DARRYL: Woah-Oh! Haven t been in one of these in forever. 
OSCAR: They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich . I m a man. So I m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out. 
OSCAR: WASSUUUUP!  
DWIGHT: Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn t on the itinerary. 
JIM: Get out. 
DWIGHT: Jim wha  Come on! What what are you gonna whack me, Jim? 
JIM: No, Dwight. You ll be doing the whacking. 
DWIGHT: A bazooka. You remembered. 
JIM: Of course I did. 
DWIGHT: . Get out of my way. 
ALL: OH!  
DWIGHT: Woo! Okay! 
JIM: Yeah!  Guten Prank number two. 
JIM: Private Room. 
OSCAR: Yeah, brosef. 
DWIGHT: Amazing. 
JIM: Enjoy, enjoy. 
GUY: Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry? 
JIM: Okay, man, easy. 
GUY:  
JIM: Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing? 
ANDY: Jim, it s fine. He ll just get you on his cell phone and then that ll go viral. 
DARRYL: That happens a lot? 
ANDY: Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success. 
OSCAR: Well, I bet it was a smash. 
ANDY: That s how I got my new job in the admissions office. 
OSCAR: Is that a volunteer program or  
ANDY: No. It s a job. Things are going great. 
DARRYL: Let s get a drink in you, huh? 
ANDY: Yes. 
MEREDITH: Whoo-hoo. Let s get this party started! 
RACHEL: Where s my angel. 
ANGELA: This is my big sister Rachel. 
RACHEL: No, this is my big sister Angela. 
ANGELA:  We re very close. We even have our own special language. 
RACHEL:  
ANGELA: People love it. 
RACHEL: They do. 
DWIGHT:  Man, how long have we been sitting here? 
STRIPPER: Hi, boys! 
ALL: Ohh  
CLARK: Here we go! 
DWIGHT: Oh, Thank God. We are famished! 
STRIPPER: Hey, did somebody order the chef special? 
DARRYL: Right there. 
DWIGHT: No, we haven t ordered anything. No one s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  
STRIPPER: I bet you boys have a big appetite. 
DWIGHT: Oh, we do. So we ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups. 
STRIPPER: Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want. 
DWIGHT: Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly? 
STRIPPER: Ohh, shh.  
DWIGHT: Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won t work. That s no good. 
ERIN: Whoo! 
ANGELA: What?  Okay. 
PAM: Oh, boy. 
ERIN: Oh! 
JAKEY: Heard you guys needed some pipes fixed or cleaned or whatever. 
PHYLLIS: Angela s special repairman is here. 
ANGELA: Wait, what is this? 
MEREDITH: Shut up. Jakey? 
JAKEY: Mom? 
PAM: Wait, wait. What? 
JAKEY: Oh, man. 
MEREDITH: No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom s not here. 
PAM: Uh, that seems inappropriate. 
MEREDITH: Give the good show, my little entrepreneur. 
JAKEY: Okay. 
MEREDITH: Take it off. . Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper s only as good as his song. 
RACHEL: oh, wowee wow. 
ANGELA: Okay  
PAM: Whoo-hoo go, Meredith s stripper son. 
ANGELA: Rachel, are you all right? 
RACHEL: I don t know! I don t know. 
ANGELA: Oh geeze. . Oh, my God! 
MEREDITH: Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look.  
ANGELA: Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith. 
MEREDITH: Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey. 
ANGELA:  Uh, no. It s o thank you. You know what? You don t have to oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It s okay. 
DWIGHT: Now, for the last time, I d like a side salad with balsamic. 
CLARK: Dwight, for the last time, she s not a waitress. 
DWIGHT: You re telling me! 
OSCAR: If you want her to leave, just tip her. 
DWIGHT: What for? We haven t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato?  Do you have those? Those aren t deep fried, right? 
ANGELA: That was interesting.  What was that? 
PHYLLIS: It s just the wind. 
ANGELA: Will you lock the door? 
PHYLLIS: Okay.  It s just the wind, see? Nothing. 
ANGELA: Alright, see, you don t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It s the wind. Just come and shut  OH! My God! 
ALL:  
ERIN: Phyllis! 
RACHEL: What s happening? 
DWIGHT: Oh, man, never thought I d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow.  
JIM: Oh, it s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled. 
DWIGHT: Good old Mose.  
JIM: They think it was Mose. 
DWIGHT: Oh, great. He s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung. 
OSCAR: What is that? 
DWIGHT: A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose. 
JIM: Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you d ever set foot in in this town? 
DWIGHT: Right. Which one is that? 
JIM: Mm, hey driver. Why don t you take us to 3030 Adams? 
JIM: Is that Mose? 
DWIGHT: Yes, it is! I am here for my bride! 
MOSE: Well, first, buy us a drink. 
ALL: If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink. 
DWIGHT: Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  Oh. 
KEVIN: Well, well, well, well, well, well. That s six  wells.  Did I get that number right, Dwight? 
DWIGHT: I heard you bought a bar, Kevin. 
KEVIN: Yes. I did. This one. Now get out! 
DWIGHT:  Why did you pick this place?  
JIM: Ooh. 
DWIGHT: You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch. 
JIM: Nope, not a prank. I think it s time for you to bury the hatchet. 
DWIGHT: Waste of a good hatchet. 
JIM: Okay, just talk. 
KEVIN: Well, w  
DWIGHT: I heard you say  well  the first time. 
JIM: I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow s his wedding day. You can t be anything but happy on your wedding day. 
DWIGHT: It was nothing personal. It s just that you were terrible at your job. 
KEVIN: You re just saying that to make me feel better. 
DWIGHT: No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer. 
KEVIN: Is that all it was? 
DWIGHT: That s it. 
KEVIN: Come here  
DWIGHT: I missed you Kevin. 
KEVIN: I missed you! 
DWIGHT: Ohh. 
MOSE: Guten Prank. 
JIM: Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three. 
DWIGHT: You ve had your drink. Now where is my bride? 
DWIGHT: Mose! What..ooh, Mose.  
ANGELA: What the  is your problem you   ?! 
JIM: Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or  
DWIGHT: No. We can t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk. 
JIM: Right. 
STANLEY: Hey guys. 
ALL: Stanley! 
ERIN: How s Florida? 
STANLEY: Oh, great. 
STANLEY: Yes, I m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds. 
JIM: Am I the only one that s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed? 
PAM: No, no, I m fine. 
JIM: Doesn t seem like anyone cares about us anyway. 
STANLEY: I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years. 
ANDY: I m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.  Just sit here and cry, just sit here and cry! Oh I can so just sit here and cry. You guys are really mean. It can t end like this you know. Slept in my car last night, quit my job. Burned all my bridges. And I did unspeakable things   You re just not good, you re just not good.   Are you insane?   You re just not good, you re just not good.   Chill out!  Just sit here and cry  
KEVIN:  People actually dance to this. It s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though. 
KEVIN:  Yeah, people hate you. 
ANDY: I ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home.  
MAN: Hey! It s Andy Bernard! 
ALL: Nard Dog!  Ree-De-De-De-Doo!  
ANDY: Ree-De-De-De-Doo! Man 
1: How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv? David 
WALLACE: It s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn t wanna know any of it. 
DWIGHT: With today s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were. 
PETE: Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So  thanks PBS. Woman 
1: Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we d all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead? 
PAM: Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don t know. I m working on something. 
JIM: She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that s fine. 
ALL: Awww. 
JIM: O-Kay. Woman 
2: All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into that  he could do anything. Anything. 
PAM:  I m sorry. Is there a question? Woman 
2: Uh, no. Man 
2: Pam, what was in that teapot letter? 
PAM: Oh, um, well, you know, I  I just  I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you d been filmed for nine years of your life, there d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself. Man 
2: I hear ya. What did it say? 
MODERATOR: We re gonna move on. Next question please. Man 
3: Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody s actually filming you anymore? 
TOBY: Yes. Woman 
3: I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate? 
MEREDITH: I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college. Woman 
4: I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you re soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia? 
JIM: Um, you know what, I actually didn t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish. 
PAM: Listen, um  I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it s better than a fairy tale. It s like a long book that you never want to end. And you re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it. Woman 
4: Like Harry Potter. 
PAM: Yeah, like Harry Potter. 
JOAN: I have a question for Erin. 
ERIN: Really? 
JOAN: Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother. 
ERIN: Thank you. 
JOAN: So my question is, um, do  don t you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her. 
ERIN: Maybe sometimes. But not like  hate  hate. More just like,  Mom, I hate you!  And then she would say  go to your room, young lady.  And I d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we d just have dinner together. But I don t know. I d have to meet her. Thanks. 
JOAN: Erin  
ERIN: Yes? 
JOAN: Um Oh, Erin.. 
ERIN: Yes? Is there a follow-up question?  Mom?  
ED: Erin  Same question but about your dad?  
MODERATOR: Well, this feels like a good place to stop. Let s thank all of our wonderful panelists for being here on this wonderful panel today.  Next week at the Scranton Cultural Center don t forget, Irish Step Dancing semifinals. Winning team to Mid-Atlantic.  
KEVIN: Where s the, uh, basket for gifts? 
USHER: Right there, sir. 
KEVIN: Okay. 
DAKOTA: Hi, I m Dakota. 
CREED: Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark. 
DAKOTA: Nice. 
CREED: My wife s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps. 
KELLY: Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister. 
RAVI: Thanks for helping out, sweetie. 
RYAN: Kelly, you re here. 
KELLY: Hey, Ryan! 
RYAN: Hey. 
KELLY: Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now? 
RYAN: No, this little guy is mine. 
RYAN: So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book.  
RYAN: Say  hi , Drake. 
KELLY: Drake is your baby s name? 
RYAN: Yeah. 
KELLY: That is an amazing name. I m obsessed with Drake. His last album  it just touched me to pieces. 
RYAN: No Kelly, he s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake. 
KELLY: Cool. Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos. 
RAVI: They re called premature, sweetie. It s good to see you again Ryan. 
PHYLLIS: Let me help you us. 
ANGELA: Thanks.  Oh. Ouch. 
PAM: Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high. 
ANGELA: No, my heels aren't too high. It s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis.  Sorry Phyllis. You didn t know. As long as I can get to the altar. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank. 
JIM: You ready? 
DWIGHT:  You kidding? I was born ready.  
JIM: Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um  I don t know how to tell you this, but  we have a little bit of a problem. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. What? 
JIM: The minister just told me that it s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom. 
DWIGHT: Oh, come on. I ve never heard of such a thing. 
JIM: I haven t heard of it, obviously. But I m out because I am significantly younger than you- 
DWIGHT: Not  significant is a big word  
JIM: I think it s definitely  Well, okay. Either way  
DWIGHT: I think you re only a teeny  
JIM: Either way, Dwight  I can t be there for you. I m sorry. 
DWIGHT: Jim. 
JIM: I just really wish there was something I could do.  
DWIGHT:   Michael. I can t believe you came. 
MICHAEL: That s what she said. 
JIM: Best prank ever. 
MINISTER: As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do. 
NELLIE:  See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow? 
KEVIN:   Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely.   
MINISTER: I now pronounce you man and wife.  Release the doves!  
KELLY: Oh. 
KEVIN: That s not  
DWIGHT: Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab  em on in there.  
DWIGHT: Everybody! 
JIM:  See, now you don t owe me anything. 
RYAN: Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he s hot. 
RAVI: Oh, no. 
RYAN: I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second? 
RAVI: Oh, yeah, you re not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside? 
RYAN: Actually, could you go inside? I m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water. 
RAVI: Are you sure you don t wanna go in? 
KELLY: Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go. 
RYAN: Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you. 
KELLY: I don t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn t look so good. 
RYAN: He ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He s allergic but he ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you. 
KELLY: You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me?  
PAM: Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills. 
PAM:  Oh, my gosh, it s choreographed! 
PAM: He just so happy to have a family plan. 
ED: Where d you learn to dance like that? 
ERIN: I don t know. I ve just always been really good at dancing. 
TOBY:   
PAM: Is it me? Is it Nellie? 
TOBY:  It s everything. 
PHYLLIS:  I missed you. 
STANLEY: I missed you too. 
PHYLLIS: Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson s a mean old grump.  But  would a grump make this? It s me. It s me. 
RYAN: I love you. 
KELLY:  I love you too. 
RYAN: We re gonna be together forever. 
KELLY: We re running off into the sunset. 
RYAN: I finally mastered commitment. 
KEVIN:  What was that stuff? 
RAVI: Hey, has anyone seen Ryan  or Kelly? 
KEVIN: Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together. 
RAVI: Oh, that s it. Here.  Call child services and report an abandoned baby. We ll find a better parent than Ryan in no time. 
KEVIN: Oh, I don t know. 
NELLIE: Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will  who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves. 
KEVIN: Hey, this is better.  
NELLIE: Yes. It is. Oh yes it is. 
NELLIE: If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We ll be somewhere in Europe.  Won t we? 
MICHAEL:  I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It s every parent s dream. 
DARRYL: Thank you go much. 
DWIGHT: Good night. 
TOBY: Good luck. 
VAL: Great. It was really fun. 
DWIGHT: Good evening. 
VAL: The Doc crew s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight. 
DARRYL: Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame.  No offense. You going, Toby? 
TOBY: Oh, I don t know. I might turn in early. 
ANDY: It s only 6:00. Come on, everybody s going. 
MEREDITH: You have to go, Toby. 
PETE: Yeah, come on, Tobes. 
VAL: Come on. 
TOBY: Yeah. I ll stop by. 
PETE: There he is! 
PAM: I need to get out of this dress. 
JIM: I gotta get out of this dress. Carol 
STILLS: Oh, I m sorry Pam. 
JIM: What s going on? 
PAM:   Why are you still here? 
CAROL:  I m so sorry. They were an hour late. 
JIM: No, really, what s going on? 
PAM: Okay, Okay. Um  so  this past year has been really great, and you ve been great and I just  I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture  and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future. 
JIM: Sorry, how long have you been showing the house? 
PAM: About 2 months 
JIM: That s why it s so clean. 
PAM: Yeah. 
JIM: I mean, you were gonna do this without me? 
PAM: Well, you  you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. 
JIM: Oh  okay. Where would we go? 
PAM: Austin? Maybe. 
JIM: I promise you, you don t have to do this for me. 
PAM: I m doing it for us. 
JIM: The last  
BUYER: Okay. We ll take it. 
JIM:  Hold on a second.  The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about  
PAM: Hold on a second.  Wait, what did you just say? 
BUYER: We wanna buy your house. 
JIM: You wanna do this? 
PAM: I wanna do this. 
JIM: You really want to do this? 
PAM: I really want to do this! 
JIM:   Oh my God! 
JIM: Hey, Darryl.  
DARRYL: What? All right! 
PAM: We re so excited. 
PHYLLIS: Cool. 
WOMAN: Oh, that s for PBS executives only. 
STANLEY: I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this. David 
WALLACE: I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I d love to contribute to your campaign. 
OSCAR: Thank you David. 
PAM: Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper ,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim.  And go ahead!  
PAM: Everyone, Let s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just I kind of meant just everybody from the office. 
PHOTOGRAPHER:  Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that s great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody. 
JIM:  Let s go outside 
PAM: Okay. 
STANLEY: Okay, I need a drink. 
KEVIN: Yeah, we all need a drink.  What the there s only dandelion tea and raisins in here. 
MEREDITH: Hey, bottom drawer. 
KEVIN: Yes! 
PAM:  Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn t work here anymore. 
PAM: I didn t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I m a tragic person. I m really happy now. But it would just just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself  be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn t that long.  
KEVIN: If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it s that if you film anybody long enough, they re going to do something stupid. It s only human natural. 
DWIGHT: Hey guys. 
ANGELA: Hi. 
ALL: Hey! 
PAM: What about the honeymoon? 
ANGELA: Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again? 
DWIGHT: Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun?  What is that meaningful look? 
JIM: You know what? Maybe we should talk. 
DARRYL: Hey, come here. You guys need to see this. 
KEVIN: What is it? 
ANDY:  You re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn... 
PAM: I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing  
JIM: Athleap. 
PAM: And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We ll come back to visit. But I think it s time for us to officially  
DWIGHT: No, don t say it. You re fired! You re both fired! 
JIM: Dwight, come on. Don t end on a bad note. 
DWIGHT: Don t be an idiot. It s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you ve been here. That s the max. 
PAM: Thanks Dwight. 
JIM: Hey, and if you re ever in Austin... 
DWIGHT: Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you re ever in the area, you ll always have a place to stay in my barn. 
JIM: There it is. 
DWIGHT: Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So  have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So yes. I d say I have gotten along with my subordinates. 
ANDY:  You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you re about to leave Cornell. So say it with 
ME: 
: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry. 
KEVIN: Oh, Yes! 
DARRYL: You did good. Real good. 
ANDY: Thanks Dad Darryl. 
ANDY: I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you re in the good old days before you ve actually left them.  Someone should write a song about that. 
OSCAR: You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It s not much. But if you see it in the right way And that s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn t once show me doing my origami. 
CREED:  Uh..ohh! 
CREED:  I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn t matter.  Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same  
JIM: Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that s an amazing gift. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome. 
JIM: Thanks Phyl. 
CREED: I still have my medal from that. 
ANGELA: Do you even have a mattress? 
CREED: No, but I still have my medal from that. 
KEVIN: Oscar. Oscar.  I think I m gay. 
OSCAR: Why do you say that? 
KEVIN:  It s just that I m so emotional. 
OSCAR: Yeah, but you re not gay. You re not gay. 
KEVIN: No, but maybe the reason  
OSCAR: You re not gay. 
CREED:  And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before. 
ERIN: How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work? 
DARRYL: Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now? 
CREED: It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But  no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home.  Let s do this. 
MEREDITH: I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You re not alone sister. Let s get a beer sometime. 
PHYLLIS: I m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down. 
JIM: I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid wonderful boring amazing job. 
PAM: I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn t that kind of the point?
