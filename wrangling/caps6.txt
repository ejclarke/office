MICHAEL:  Parkour! Dwight & 
ANDY:  
ANDY: Parkour! 
DWIGHT:  Extreme! Parkour! 
JIM: This... is Parkour.  Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive.  The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital. 
DWIGHT:  Dwight & 
ANDY:  Parkour! Parkour! 
DWIGHT: Andy! Leapfrog!  
ANDY: Do me! Do me! 
DWIGHT: Yeah!  Parkour! Parkour! 
ANDY: Ow! Get off! Get off! 
DWIGHT: Okay. Andy & 
MICHAEL:  Parkour! Parkour! 
DWIGHT:  Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera!  
MICHAEL:  Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time. 
ANDY: Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster,  360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can. Michael & 
DWIGHT:  Yeah! Gainer! Woohoo! 
ANDY:  Hardcore Parkour! 
MICHAEL: Parkoooooour! 
DWIGHT: Let's do it! 
ANDY:  Michael & 
DWIGHT:  
ANDY:  Parkour! 
DWIGHT:  Good. Excellent. Thank you. Female 
INTERN:  There you go. Is there anything else I can do? 
DWIGHT:  Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk? Female 
INTERN:  Mm hmm. 
DWIGHT: Go put them all in random order. Female 
INTERN:  Mm-kay. 
DWIGHT: Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order. 
PAM: This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident.  He didn't do anything sexual.  He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes.  It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program. 
MEREDITH:  Think she did him? 
OSCAR: I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer. 
KELLY: If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself. 
MICHAEL:  Who's getting married? 
PAM: Nobody. 
MICHAEL: If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming. 
KELLY: It's Eric and Megan. 
MICHAEL: Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly. 
PHYLLIS: They're not getting married. It's just talk. 
MICHAEL: Did everybody know about this but me? 
PHYLLIS: There's nothing to know, it's just gossip. 
MICHAEL:  Okay... okay.  
PAM:  We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant. 
JIM: Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day. 
PAM: Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum. 
JIM: Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun? 
PAM: Nope. 
JIM: No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything. 
PAM: Can't back out now, Halpert. 
JIM: What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last! 
PAM: No, keep it up. 
MICHAEL:  You'll never guess what I know. 
DWIGHT:  Okay, let me finish this thought. 
MICHAEL: Eric likes Megan. 
DWIGHT:  He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well. 
MICHAEL:  How do you know this? 
DWIGHT:  People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom.  Okay, what is it, what can't I guess? 
MICHAEL: I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball? 
MICHAEL:  Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said "The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle." 
MAURIE: What are you talking about? 
MICHAEL: I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric. 
MAURIE: At Tink's? 
MICHAEL: Yes 
MAURIE: How'd you know about that? 
MICHAEL: Well... 
MAURIE: Did Stanley tell you? 
MICHAEL:  Stanley was on your group date? 
MAURIE: No, Stanley was with his wife. I waved at him, but he didn't wave back. 
MICHAEL:  Does anybody else know about this? 
MAURIE: No. 
MICHAEL:  
MICHAEL: There he goes. There he goes.  
MICHAEL: So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything? Dwight, Jim & 
PAM:  
MICHAEL: Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say... 
PAM: Just keep it to yourself then. 
MICHAEL: Stanly is having a midlife crisis. 
DWIGHT: Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio. 
MICHAEL: Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people. 
PHYLLIS: Teri's out of town, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Who? 
PHYLLIS: Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts. 
MICHAEL:  
MICHAEL:  You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up. 
MAURIE: What are you talking about? 
MICHAEL: Stanley's wife is out of town. 
MAURIE: He was with somebody. 
ERIC: He was definitely with somebody. 
MICHAEL: Oh, was he? Well who, his sister? 
ERIC:  
MICHAEL:  I don't get it! 
ERIC: If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal. 
MICHAEL: Drugs? 
ERIC: Making out. 
MICHAEL:  Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on. 
MICHAEL:  Stanley is having an affir. 
KELLY: WHAT?? 
MICHAEL: I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention. 
MICHAEL:  That and that are the same letter. 
KEVIN: Q. 
MICHAEL: No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed? 
KEVIN: T. 
MICHAEL: T! Yes! Yes! That is a "T", and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there. 
MICHAEL:  Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good? 
STANLEY: I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that? 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody? 
STANLEY: Goodbye.  
MICHAEL: Pays five million dollars. Nudity required. 
JIM:  You have to stop this. 
MICHAEL:  Did you hear Stanley's having an affair? 
JIM: I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser... 
JIM: Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life. 
MICHAEL:  
MICHAEL:  Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real.  Stanley, are you having an affair? 
STANLEY:  That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that? 
MICHAEL: So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip. 
STANLEY:  Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club. 
MICHAEL:  So stupid! 
STANLEY: It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot... 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. 
STANLEY: And it's been lonely. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I bet. 
STANLEY: Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't... 
MICHAEL: Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true? 
STANLEY: Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool. 
STANLEY: I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please. 
MICHAEL:  I'm not saying... a damn thing. 
STANLEY: I'm counting on you, Michael. 
MICHAEL:  You can count on me. 
STANLEY:  
MICHAEL:  Oh, that smells good. 
KEVIN: I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat. 
MICHAEL: Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird. 
KEVIN: Yeah... what do you mean exactly? 
MICHAEL: Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike. 
KEVIN: Reeeeally. 
MICHAEL: Uh huh.  Alright? 
MICHAEL: How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including "Stanley is having an affair." It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit. 
ERIN: Kelly has an eating disorder? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
ERIN: She always eats my lunch. 
MICHAEL: Anorexia. She's an anorexatic. 
ERIN: We should do something. 
MICHAEL: Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess. 
MICHAEL:  I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here. 
KELLY: Really? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. So... and Andy is gay. 
KELLY: Andy Bernard?? 
MICHAEL: Mm hmm. 
MICHAEL:  Did you hear Pam is pregnant? 
MEREDITH: Really? 
MICHAEL: Yeah! 
MEREDITH: She's gonna hate being a mom. 
ANDY:  
KEVIN:  
ANDY: What? 
KEVIN:  Tea. 
ANDY: So? 
KEVIN: You would. 
ANDY:  I like tea! 
KEVIN:  Oh, I bet you like it. 
ANDY: Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea! 
KEVIN: Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts? 
ANDY: WHAT?? 
KEVIN: Because you're gay. 
ANDY:  Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school? 
ANDY: This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird.  Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course.  But it makes you wonder. 
ANDY:  Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay? 
OSCAR:  I did. Yes. 
ANDY: And? 
OSCAR: What? 
ANDY: Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay? 
OSCAR: Are you attracted to other men? 
ANDY:  No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent,  I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like. 
OSCAR:  
ANDY: Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive? 
OSCAR: If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you? 
ANDY: It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario. 
OSCAR: Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay. 
OSCAR: What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me. 
PHYLLIS: How far along is Pam? 
MEREDITH: A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding. 
MICHAEL:  Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go. 
MICHAEL:  Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors. 
DWIGHT:  Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night. 
ERIC: Why would we call you at night? 
DWIGHT:  Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved. 
JIM:  You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs. 
DWIGHT: Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right.  One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you  will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be. 
ERIN:  I am so happy you're eating again. 
KELLY:  Me too! 
ANDY:  Tuna, how come you never try to set me up? 
JIM: Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though. 
ANDY: Women friends? 
JIM: Yep. 
ANDY: Not guy friends? 
JIM: Are you... interested in her guy friends? 
ANDY: No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women. 
JIM: Okay. 
ANDY: But off the record, I'm kinda confused. 
JIM: Really. 
ANDY: Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like... 
JIM: Well you gotta figure this out. 
ANDY: Yeah, right? 
JIM: Yeah! 
ANDY: How? 
JIM: You gotta have sex with a woman. 
ANDY: Right-o. 
JIM: And a man. 
ANDY: Ohh... 
JIM: And then compare. 
ANDY: Alright.  Well hey... 
JIM: Yep. 
ANDY: Congratulations to you. 
JIM: On what? 
ANDY:  Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro. 
JIM:  
ANGELA:  Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard? 
PAM: What? 
ANGELA: Want me to say it again? 
PAM: Why did that come into your brain? 
JIM:  Can I talk to you for a second? 
JIM:  So, they know. 
PAM: Who did you tell? 
JIM: I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell? 
PAM: Nobody! 
CREED:  Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba. 
CREED: If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward? 
OSCAR:  What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog? 
TOBY:  What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin? 
JIM: Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today? 
EVERYONE:  Yes. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors. 
JIM: Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff? 
MICHAEL: That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap. 
PAM: Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning. 
KEVIN: I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls? 
CREED: I heard that from... Andy. 
ANDY: I heard it from Erin. 
ERIN: I heard it from Michael. 
MICHAEL:  
PAM:  Michael?  He's over here! 
PAM:  Where are you going? 
MICHAEL: Nowhere. 
DWIGHT: Michael...  You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm?  
PAM: Don't get on it.  
JIM: Michael, don't. 
PAM: Don't... get... on. Do not. 
JIM: Michael... 
KEVIN: Stay. 
PAM: Step away. 
CREED: Come on, boss. 
MICHAEL:  
MICHAEL:  Okay, I made it all up. 
EVERYONE:  
ANDY: Even the fact that I'm gay? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
ANDY:  Yes! 
MICHAEL: But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model. 
ANGELA: No. We heard that about Jim. 
MICHAEL: Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself. 
ANGELA: How is that a bad rumor? 
MICHAEL: Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit. 
OSCAR: Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog... 
STANLEY:  You told everyone I was having an affair? 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person. 
KELLY: Well then, what's the one true rumor? 
PHYLLIS: We have a right to know. 
ANDY: Michael... am I gay? 
MICHAEL:  The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that... 
JIM:  That Pam's pregnant. 
ANGELA: I knew it! 
KEVIN: I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought "Oh, she has a new bra with padding." But then I thought "Pam doesn't need padding." It just didn't add up, Jim. 
JIM: Okay. Thank you. 
PHYLLIS: Congratulations! 
ERIN: That's really great, you guys. 
RYAN: Don't vaccinate it. 
DWIGHT: Who's the father? 
PAM: Jim. 
CREED: How far along? 
JIM: Four months. 
CREED: Who's the OB/GYN? 
PAM: Stop. Don't. Just... 
MICHAEL: Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair. 
JIM: Nope. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Jim... 
JIM:  Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it. 
PAM: Yes. 
JIM: If everyone would like to see proof. 
PAM: Okay.  
KELLY: Are we just gonna wait here?  
EVERYONE:  
KELLY: It's true! 
MICHAEL: Look at that!  That is the inside of your vagina!  
PAM:  It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now.  
MICHAEL:  How long have you known about the pregnancy? Jim & 
PAM:  
MICHAEL: A week? A month? A year? 
JIM: Michael, we only told our parents last week. 
MICHAEL: Did you pee on a stick? 
JIM: I did. It was inconclusive. 
MICHAEL: You should've told me. 
PAM:  You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this. 
MICHAEL:  
ERIN: Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call. 
MICHAEL:  
PAM:  You called Stanley's wife? 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God. 
JIM: Don't take it. 
MICHAEL: No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious. 
PAM: If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious. 
MICHAEL: No, no, I can do this. 
JIM: You can't do this. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over. 
JIM: That sounds terrible. 
PAM: Michael, please don't. 
MICHAEL:  Hey, what up, Cynthia?  
JIM:  
MICHAEL: Hold on a second, Cynthia. 
JIM:  
MICHAEL: Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly.  Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess  and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try. 
MAURIE:  I learned that a company can describe their internship as "full of exciting experiences," even if that's a lie. There's no regulation. 
MEGAN: I learned that half these people's email password is "password." 
ERIC: I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets. 
MEGAN: I thought it was 500. 
ERIC: Oh... I guess I didn't learn anything. 
MAURIE: I learned that if you look even the tiniest bit like Jet Li, Michael will call you "Jet Li" all summer. 
MEGAN:  Julia Stiles. 
ERIC:  Alan Thicke. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah? 
OSCAR: You wanted to see me? 
MICHAEL: Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me. 
OSCAR: Yeah sure. 
MICHAEL: I'm going in for a procedure today. 
OSCAR: Is everything okay? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared. 
OSCAR: I'm sure everything will be fine.  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking? 
MICHAEL: It is a colonoscopy. 
OSCAR: Okay. 
MICHAEL: In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?  Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry? 
OSCAR:  Oh my God. 
MICHAEL: My main concern, should I have a safe word? 
OSCAR: Yeah.  David 
WALLACE: So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday? 
MICHAEL: Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night. 
DAVID: Okay, I will look at it Monday. 
MICHAEL: Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds. 
DAVID: Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room? 
JIM: Sure. 
PAM: Hey, Good luck. 
MICHAEL: Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  What's this about? 
JIM: Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay. 
MICHAEL: It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there. 
DAVID: No, ah it's okay Michael. We got it. 
MICHAEL: Really? 
DAVID: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Alright, do you mind if it sit this out? I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out. 
DAVID:  Okay.  
MICHAEL: Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me? No, because we are the Three Amigos. And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.  
MICHAEL: Hey let me escort you to your desk. 
PAM: Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you. 
MICHAEL: You and Jim are close, huh? 
PAM: Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together. 
MICHAEL: Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you... 
PAM: Ummm, I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in. 
PAM: Did I? Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious. 
MICHAEL: If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk. 
PAM: Please don't talk about my breast milk. 
MICHAEL: I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you? 
PAM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: I just don't want you to. 
DARRYL: I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me. 
TOBY: And that's how you broke your ankle? 
DARRYL: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it? 
DARRYL: This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away. 
DWIGHT: Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden. 
DARRYL: If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare. 
DWIGHT: Nnnnn, that's not... okay. 
DARRYL: Be quiet. 
DWIGHT: I'm talking about... hmmm. 
TOBY: I will send this off to corporate. Make sure you hold on to your medical bills. Feel better. 
DARRYL: Thanks T-Man, later.  He's lying. 
TOBY: He has a doctor's note. 
DWIGHT: Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders. 
TOBY: A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news. 
DWIGHT: Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  Y'all having birthday cake? 
TOBY: That's not a very good Darryl. 
DWIGHT: Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes? 
TOBY: Hmmm. 
DWIGHT: It just doesn't add up. 
TOBY: Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point. The ladder didn't reach the top shelf. I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  I'll punch you in da mush, see. 
MICHAEL:  Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now. I will... I love you too. Bye. 
JIM: Who was that? 
MICHAEL: Sorry about that. What'd I miss? 
DAVID: Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind. 
MICHAEL: Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this... call waiting.  Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes. 
CREED:  They've been in there a while. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
CREED: Can't be good. 
MICHAEL: Nope. 
CREED: Think they're talking about me? 
MICHAEL: No, I think they're talking about me. 
CREED: Yeah, that makes way more sense. Okay thanks boss. 
MICHAEL: What is Jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That 's bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you there has been work everyday. Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here. 
PAM: Hey Kelly. 
KELLY: Ugh, so jealous of your boobs. 
PAM: Thank you. Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine. 
KELLY: Is Ryan going? 
PAM: I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet. 
PAM: We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off, if they came. So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work. 
KELLY: Here's the deal. I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time. That came out wrong. It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim. 
ANDY: What can I do for ya Hoss? 
MICHAEL:  How are your sales doin'? 
ANDY: How are my sales doin'? Busted. My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy. You're not buying it, you're good. Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately. I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer. 
PHYLLIS: Again with the cousin. 
ANDY: Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay. "Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha." 
MICHAEL: Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay? 
MICHAEL: Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed. 
MICHAEL: You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work? Well, I don't believe that. I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart. It is just elegant. 
MICHAEL:  Be my eyes. 
ANDY: You got it. 
STANLEY: What have we here? 
ANDY: Oh, just backing up and turning around. 
KEVIN: Hey, we're gonna do this... 
ANDY: Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you.  Pardon moi, Messieurs. I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room. 
DAVID: Cheese platter? 
ANDY: Oui, Oui, Monsieur. From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar. Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan. Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious. At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing. If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese. Bon appetit. 
DAVID: Alright, well I should go. Thanks for this. You've given me a lot to think about. Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak. 
JIM: No, I won't. Alright, thanks for giving me your time, I appreciate it. 
DAVID: Thank you Jim. 
DAVID: Erin, is Michael around? 
ERIN: I think he's around here... 
MICHAEL:  Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me. How you doin'? 
DAVID: Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second? 
MICHAEL: Yes, definitely. 
TOBY:  Sounds like a EMDP-40. 
DWIGHT: Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched. 
TOBY: You're into trains? 
DWIGHT: I have been my whole life. 
TOBY: Wow. 
DWIGHT: I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house. 
TOBY: That's so cool. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
TOBY: Wow, I'd love to take a look at that. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime. 
TOBY: Well, you know, 'cause of the trains. 
DWIGHT: Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming. 
TOBY: Uhh, oh boy, oh boy. 
DWIGHT: Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera! 
TOBY: Get over there! Get over there! 
DWIGHT: Oh, worker's comp, my ass! 
TOBY: I can't believe this.  Hey you, ass****! 
DWIGHT: Toby... 
TOBY: You gonna eat all that dog food yourself? 
DWIGHT: Ooohhh...  Oh man! You okay? 
TOBY: Just keep going. 
PAM: Hey Ryan. 
RYAN: Hey. 
PAM: So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding. 
RYAN: Yeah, I might stop by. 
PAM: It costs about $75 per person. 
RYAN: Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77. 
PAM: Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not? 
RYAN: Yes, I'm coming to your wedding. 
PAM: Okay, Ryan Howard, yes. 
RYAN: Probably, yes. 
PAM: Kelly Kapoor, yes. 
DAVID: Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites? 
MICHAEL: Look who you're talking to. 
DAVID: I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents. 
MICHAEL: Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever. 
DAVID: What about Jim? Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position? 
MICHAEL:  Permission to speak on the record? 
DAVID: Please do. 
MICHAEL: Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don't think so. Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe. 
DAVID: I thought you liked Jim? 
MICHAEL: Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here. Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable. 
DAVID:  "Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is." 
MICHAEL: It's not very well written, but you get the gist. 
DAVID: Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch? 
MICHAEL: I can just continue to run it myself. 
DAVID: Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position. 
MICHAEL: This was Jim's idea? 
DAVID: Mmhmm. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block. 
DAVID: Ummm... okay, here's the thing though. The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you. I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer. We may have to replace him. 
JIM: I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help. Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon. 
DAVID: Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second. 
JIM: Sure. 
MICHAEL:  I can't help but feel partially responsible. 
MICHAEL:  Little pick me up?  Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush. 
JIM: When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all? 
MICHAEL: Well we did talk about how handsome you are. 
JIM: Why don't we head in your office to talk? 
MICHAEL: Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said... 
JIM: Michael, look I'll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed. 
MICHAEL: Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy. 
JIM: Michael, did you say anything? 
MICHAEL: Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion. 
JIM: Really? 
MICHAEL: Yes! 
JIM: You will? Wanna do it right now? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
JIM: I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark. 
DWIGHT: I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated. 
TOBY: If they were dilated... 
DARRYL: Toby! Dwight! Is that them? 
GWENNETH: Definitely. 
DARRYL: You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food. 
DWIGHT: We thought that she was you. 
DARRYL: Why would you think a lady is me? 
DWIGHT: Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this? 
TOBY: No, nah. I don't see it. 
DARRYL: Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you. 
DWIGHT: Aww, Darryl. 
DARRYL: C'mon Gwenneth. 
GWENNETH: Sad. 
DAVID:  This is David. 
MICHAEL: Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  Michael Scott here. 
DAVID: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction. 
DAVID: So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim? Michael 
: Absolutely,  not.  Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job. 
DAVID: Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier. 
MICHAEL: Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him. 
DAVID: Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file. 
MICHAEL: Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. Toby Flenderson is doing drugs. 
DAVID: Michael, I really don't know what's going on  down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit. 
TOBY: Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh... 
DARRYL: Cool. 
DWIGHT: Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator. 
TOBY: What? 
DWIGHT: He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed. 
DARRYL: Stupidest thing I've ever heard. 
DWIGHT: Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby. 
TOBY: Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain... 
DARRYL: Alright, yeah fine so whatever... 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
TOBY: You really did it... 
DWIGHT: Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form. 
DARRYL: And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister. 
DWIGHT: Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that... 
TOBY: Ahhh, kay. Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives. 
TOBY: So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork. We worked it out. 
MICHAEL: Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face. Alright, Just do it. 
JIM: How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job. 
MICHAEL: I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam,  and now I don't wanna lose the baby. 
JIM: So instead, you screwed me? 
MICHAEL: That's what she... 
JIM: No. 
ERIN: David Wallace is calling. 
MICHAEL: Kind of in the middle of something here. 
ERIN: Should I tell him you'll call him back? 
MICHAEL: I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself. Let's both. 
MICHAEL:  Hello. 
DAVID: Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you? 
MICHAEL: No, it's just us. 
DAVID: Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please. 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  Come in.  
JIM: Hi David. 
DAVID: Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool. But it only works if everyone's on board. 
MICHAEL: Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager. 
DAVID: We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff. 
JIM: Wow, that sounds pretty cool. 
MICHAEL: I like that, so manager and co-manager. 
DAVID: Co-manager and Co-manager. See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs. 
MICHAEL: Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager. 
DAVID: Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do? 
DWIGHT: Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed... 
MICHAEL: Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement? 
DWIGHT: I'm... I was making it. 
MICHAEL: Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager. 
STANLEY: Co-manager of what? 
MICHAEL: Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts. 
PHYLLIS: What's happening to you Michael? 
MICHAEL: What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome. 
JIM:  Thank you.  
DWIGHT: AHHHHHHHHHHHH! 
MEREDITH: Niagara Falls in October? Pfft, hells yeah. 
PAM: Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card? 
MEREDITH: Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier. 
PAM: Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging... 
MEREDITH: I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs. I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you. 
PAM: You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding. 
MEREDITH: Uh huh. 
PAM: To ask for directions.. 
MEREDITH: Right... 
PAM: And you will eat whatever is fanciest? 
MEREDITH: Unless there's ribs.  
ANGELA: Rude. 
PAM: So rude, right? 
ANGELA: Mmm hmmm. 
PAM:  Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible. 
ANGELA: Pam, my bag was there... 
DWIGHT:  Could you please sign my expense report? 
MICHAEL: No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic. 
DWIGHT:  Sign this. 
JIM: Ah, ah, ah. Where's the "please"? We're not animals. 
DWIGHT: Sign it. 
JIM: No, not without a "please." 
DWIGHT: Idiot. 
DWIGHT:  I have a complaint about Jim. 
MICHAEL: That is not big picture. 
DWIGHT: I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office. 
MICHAEL: ... Okay. 
DWIGHT: Jim won't sign my expense report. 
MICHAEL: That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day. 
DWIGHT: No, that is huge. 
MICHAEL: You're trying to trick me. 
DWIGHT: This has to do-- 
MICHAEL: Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. 
DWIGHT:  I'd like to lodge a complaint. 
JIM: I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about? 
DWIGHT: You! 
JIM: Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen? 
DWIGHT: One minute ago. 
JIM: Okay. And how do you feel? 
DWIGHT: Angry. 
JIM: All right. Did he hit you? 
DWIGHT: No. 
JIM: Did you cry? 
DWIGHT: No. 
JIM: Did you feel like crying? 
DWIGHT: No. 
JIM: I'm just gonna write "held back tears." 
DWIGHT: Wait, stop writing that. That is not true. 
JIM: If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it. 
DWIGHT: I'm not cr-- uhh! 
DWIGHT: I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious!  Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah! 
ERIN:  Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down. 
MICHAEL: Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while. 
JIM: Michael... 
MICHAEL: Yes? 
JIM: Can I talk to you in my office for a second? 
MICHAEL: Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office? 
STANLEY: Can I also be a boss? 
OSCAR: Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes? 
JIM: I have noticed that we-- 
MICHAEL: Welcome. 
JIM: Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um-- 
MICHAEL: Disruptive. 
JIM: Yes. 
MICHAEL: No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important. 
JIM: Okay, maybe we should talk specifics. 
MICHAEL: Let's do. 
JIM: Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets. 
MICHAEL: N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim? 
JIM: I am. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets... 
JIM: Right. 
MICHAEL: At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are. 
JIM: Yes, I agree. 
MICHAEL: Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust. 
JIM: I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day. 
MICHAEL: You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea. 
JIM: You mean on a weekend? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
JIM: How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential. 
MICHAEL: Alright. No more meetings this week. 
JIM: Really? You just agreed to that? 
MICHAEL: I can be very suprising. 
PHYLLIS: What's going on? 
PAM: I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant. 
RYAN: You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts? 
PAM: We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much. 
PAM: It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash? 
PHYLLIS: Perfect. I hate registries. 
PAM: Oh, good. 
PHYLLIS: My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you? 
PAM: No, we're not. 
PHYLLIS: Good. Good. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm? 
JIM:  Okay, I thought I saw people missing. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each. 
JIM: Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door? 
MICHAEL: Stanley, you don't need to answer that. 
JIM: Stanley? 
STANLEY: "If you don't smell this, you're fired." 
JIM: Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these. 
MICHAEL: What do you mean by "these people"? 
JIM: Michael, this is a conference room meeting. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room. 
JIM: That's not what I meant. 
MICHAEL: Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want. 
JIM: I disagree. 
MICHAEL: What do you guys think?  
JIM: Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael? 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people. 
JIM: That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager. 
MICHAEL: That is not what Wallace told us. 
JIM: That's exactly what Wallace told us. 
MICHAEL: That is not the way I heard it. 
KELLY: I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C. Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible. 
MICHAEL: It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around. 
JIM: I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace.  I will call David Wallace. 
ERIN: David Wallace is on line two for you guys. 
MICHAEL: Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just-- 
JIM: Hey, David. You got Jim here. 
MICHAEL: Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager. David 
WALLACE: Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it. 
MICHAEL: Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision. 
JIM: Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees. David 
WALLACE: It's probably a little of both. 
MICHAEL: Which is it more of? David 
WALLACE: Excuse me? 
JIM: David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work. David 
WALLACE: Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me? 
MICHAEL: I thought maybe we could talk after this is over. David 
WALLACE: Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it? 
JIM: Nope, not at all. 
MICHAEL: No, it will not be. I am on top of it. David 
WALLACE: Very good. 
JIM: Alright, thanks alot, David. 
MICHAEL: Talk to you later--  Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye.  Alright, I am looking forward to this. 
JIM: You don't have to lie. 
MICHAEL: I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore. 
JIM: Right. 
MICHAEL: All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are. 
JIM: Alright. Let's get started. 
CREED: Hey, why haven't we ever, um... 
MEREDITH: We have. 
MICHAEL: You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it. 
JIM: Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll? 
MICHAEL: No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim. 
JIM: Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options. 
MICHAEL: Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way? 
JIM: It's hard to tell so far. 
MICHAEL: You use your brain too much. 
JIM: I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less? 
MICHAEL: Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all. 
JIM: You just came up with that. 
MICHAEL: As I was saying it. 
JIM: Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit. 
MICHAEL:  Con-- you look like a nerd. 
JIM: Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year. 
MICHAEL: Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds. 
JIM: Pro-- no favoritism. 
MICHAEL: Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there. 
JIM: I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart--  How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it. 
KEVIN: Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where. 
PAM: I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash. 
KEVIN: Like money? Like you-- you want my money? 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
KEVIN: Will you take a check? 
PAM: Yeah. 
KEVIN: Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, "To love's eternal glory." 
PAM: Okay. 
KEVIN: Wait til' Monday. 
PAM: Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible.  oh look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!" That's the first time I've seen it in writing! 
JIM: You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen. 
MICHAEL: That will not go over well. 
JIM: I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us... 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself. 
JIM: I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking. 
MICHAEL: No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue. 
JIM: Michael. 
MICHAEL: And then another-- 
JIM: Look, you have a lot of strengths. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are. 
JIM: I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well. 
MICHAEL: Ha! That-- I am not known for that! 
JIM: But there is a reason why I'm here! 
MICHAEL: Yes! You went over my head to Wallace! 
JIM: No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael! 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me? 
JIM: I don't think you're good at making tough decisions! 
MICHAEL: Ah. 
JIM: At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision. 
MICHAEL: Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?! 
JIM: But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them?  You call it. 
JIM:  
MICHAEL:  This had better be terrible. 
JIM: Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff. 
MEREDITH: Wait. Seriously?! 
JIM: Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults. 
OSCAR: Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people. 
ANGELA: But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises? 
OSCAR: Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with. 
JIM: Ooh, easy. That's not it at all. 
OSCAR: Well? 
JIM: Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office. 
KELLY:  What's going on? 
KEVIN: Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen. 
KELLY: What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?! 
OSCAR: Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart? 
KELLY: No!  How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?! 
DWIGHT: This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?! 
JIM: Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so-- 
DWIGHT: What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?! 
OSCAR: Exactly! 
KEVIN: Totally! 
OSCAR: We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises. 
CREED: Yes. 
ANGELA: Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em! 
MEREDITH: My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?! 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Her kid needs shoes, Jim! 
MEREDITH: What the hell?!  
JIM: Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so...  
MICHAEL: That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This-- 
ANGELA: What are you talking about Michael? 
STANLEY: We just need to hear your plan for our raise. 
MICHAEL: My plan-- a man-- panama. 
ANDY: That's not how that goes. 
MEREDITH: You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct... 
JIM: Thank you, Meredith. 
MEREDITH: ...when he was telling us his dumbass plan. 
OSCAR: We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no? 
MICHAEL: Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise?  Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do. 
OSCAR: Again, that gives us no information. 
PHYLLIS: This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood! 
MICHAEL: What about a raise based on merit? 
JIM: Rank each person individually? 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best. 
JIM:  Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started.  
MICHAEL: Are you making a-- 
JIM: Nope. I'm numbering the paper. 
OSCAR:  Just-- 
KEVIN: Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us. 
ANGELA: It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting! 
MEREDITH: I am so pissed at this company! 
DWIGHT:  And Jim! 
MEREDITH: Yeah. Who said that? 
DWIGHT: I think it was Creed. 
CREED: Yep. 
JIM:  It's going really well, actually. 
JIM:  Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture  of who you think deserv-- who's that?  
MICHAEL: Toby. 
JIM: He's not a part of this. You know that. 
MICHAEL: Just wanted to draw a picture of him. 
JIM: Okay, your move. 
MICHAEL: Alright! Who to pick?  Who to pick? 
JIM: Here we go. 
MICHAEL: I... will skip a turn. 
JIM: Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that. 
MICHAEL: I need more time. 
ERIN: Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.  
DWIGHT: People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly. 
DWIGHT: Come on in.  That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces. 
OSCAR: What the hell?! 
DWIGHT: Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager. 
MICHAEL: Hey, what are you guys doing in here? 
KEVIN: What does a bean mean? 
PAM: Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me? 
KEVIN: Michael, what does a bean mean? 
PAM: Jim? 
JIM: I was just trying to be unbiased. 
KEVIN: What does a bean mean?! 
OSCAR: Someone please explain it to Kevin. 
MEREDITH: Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours. 
PHYLLIS: Not according to the beans. 
ANGELA: This is how you make this important decision? 
ANDY: There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me.  That is ridiculous. This is how it works.  
PHYLLIS: It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning! 
ANDY: Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I would, too. 
DWIGHT: Are we idiots?  What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?! 
PHYLLIS: I say no. 
DWIGHT: No, I mean, what do you say to my plan?  Okay. 
MICHAEL:  
KEVIN: What does a bean mean? 
MICHAEL:  How you doing? 
JIM: Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four. 
MICHAEL: Oh, what are you usually? 
JIM: Six. You? 
MICHAEL: Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero. 
JIM: I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right? 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. 
JIM: We tried to find the fairest way to do it. 
MICHAEL: Yes, we did. 
JIM: I just-- what? 
MICHAEL: Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.  
PHYLLIS: Michael! 
KEVIN: Michael! 
PHYLLIS: Come on! This isn't fair! 
JIM:  Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset? 
PHYLLIS:  Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this! 
JIM:  Thank you. 
MICHAEL: You're welcome. 
JIM: What's in here? 
MICHAEL: Gin.  
JIM: Ooh! 
MICHAEL:  Just pretend we're not here. 
RYAN: Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding? 
PAM: Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you. 
RYAN: Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now? 
PAM: $100 now for sure. 
RYAN: Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift... 
PAM: Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred. 
RYAN: Instead of $5,000 a year from now? 
PAM: How sure is this? 
PAM: The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game. 
PAM:  Don't tell Jim. 
PAM: I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room? 
JIM: We would really appreciate it. 
DWIGHT: Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass. 
PAM: Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy. 
PHYLLIS: Now this is getting ridiculous. 
DWIGHT: Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk. 
MEREDITH: All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone. 
PAM: I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace. 
ANDY:  Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...  
MICHAEL:  What do you think? I spent all morning on it. 
JIM: It is really special. 
PAM: Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great. 
MICHAEL: It's just a really important day for me. 
JIM: Well, congrats. 
MICHAEL: Thanks. 
ERIN: Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day. 
JIM: Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column. 
KEVIN: So... you're going to provide them, then? 
JIM: No. This is a fire cracker free wedding. 
KEVIN: What the hell? 
DWIGHT: Come on. You've got to be kidding me. 
PAM: Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding. 
JIM: Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended. 
ANGELA: Decent people everywhere will get offended. 
PAM: Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned. 
ANGELA: Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers. 
JIM: That's nice. 
PAM: You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding. 
ANGELA: Really, Pam... 
MICHAEL: Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time.  
ANGELA: Ow! He pinched me! 
MICHAEL: No. 
PAM: Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married. 
DWIGHT: We'll see. 
PAM: Thank you, Dwight. 
JIM: Good-bye. 
PAM: See you later.  
MICHAEL: And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara. 
ANDY: What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara.  
MICHAEL: Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke. 
ANDY: No... I didn't steal your joke. 
MICHAEL: Yes. I said that yesterday. 
DWIGHT: But you can say that about anything. 
MICHAEL: Dwight... 
DWIGHT: What happens in accounting, stays in accounting. 
KEVIN: Oh yeah. 
MICHAEL: No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke. 
DWIGHT: It's easy. That's what I'm saying. 
MICHAEL: This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls! 
MICHAEL: Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe. 
DWIGHT: I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family. 
MICHAEL: Get out of here. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster. 
MICHAEL: There's... a name. 
DWIGHT: Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn. 
DWIGHT: Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately. 
MICHEAL: Ok. 
DWIGHT: She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike. 
MICHAEL: Is that all you have on her? 
DWIGHT: Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name. 
MICHAEL: You're an idiot. 
KEVIN: People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair.  It's the hair--  Ok. Ok. I'm going.  God. 
ANDY:  Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to? It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know. 
KELLY: This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver. 
ANDY: Mmm-hmm. Erin? 
ERIN: Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back. 
ANDY: Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom. 
PAM:  Hey, my aunt told me something neat. 
JIM: Yeah? 
PAM: She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points. 
JIM: Oh, wow. That's cool. 
PAM: Yeah. 
JIM:  Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever. 
PAM: Oh. 
JIM: Lousy Picture. 
PAM: We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures. 
MICHAEL:  Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep. 
DWIGHT: What? No way! 
MICHAEL: Those glasses are super dark. 
DWIGHT: Oh. God. 
MICHAEL: Alright. We need some tunes, I think. 
DWIGHT: You know what? I made you a cd... 
MICHAEL: You did? 
DWIGHT: Mmm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: That was nice of you. 
DWIGHT: This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room. 
MICHAEL: Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in. 
DWIGHT: You're gonna like this.  "Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--"  
MICHAEL: Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room? 
DWIGHT: Yeah. It's practical. 
MICHAEL: No. No. That's not how it works. 
JIM: Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun. Front Desk 
CLERK: Halpert... 
JIM: And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite. Front Desk 
CLERK: Great. 
JIM: I know. We're pretty excited, too. 
PAM: Can we take a look at the suite now? Front Desk 
CLERK: Oh, I'm sorry. Somebody just checked in. 
PAM: Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend? Front Desk 
CLERK: Oh, no. Just an individual. That man over there. 
ANDY: Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed.  
JIM: I don't like that. 
PAM: I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please. 
MICHAEL: Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott. Front Desk 
CLERK: One moment while I check. 
DWIGHT: The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement. 
MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm. Front Desk 
CLERK: I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not seeing you in here. When did you make your reservation? 
MICHAEL: I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms. Front Desk 
CLERK: Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. I'm afraid we're all sold out. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation 
NUMBER: Romeo. Tango. G7745. Front Desk 
CLERK: Yes. Schrute. 
DWIGHT: And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes? Front Desk 
CLERK: Sure. No problem. 
DWIGHT: Ok. Front Desk 
CLERK: Here's your key, Mr. Schrute. 
MICHAEL: Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room. 
DWIGHT: No way. What if I meet someone? 
MICHAEL: I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: No. No. 
MICHAEL: I would do the same for you. 
DWIGHT: You would? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Really? 
MICHAEL: Yes... just go-- 
DWIGHT: Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Thank God. 
DWIGHT: Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you? 
MICHAEL: Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why. 
DWIGHT: Please? 
MICHAEL: If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay. 
DWIGHT: Mmm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
DWIGHT: Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha!  That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me. 
MICHAEL: I don't have a room? 
DWIGHT: No you do not. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.' 
DWIGHT: It worked. 
MICHAEL: Jerk. 
MICHAEL: When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet. 
STANLEY: Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson. 
MICHAEL: Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight? 
STANLEY: Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me. 
MICHAEL: Not in the same bed. In the other bed. 
STANLEY: I got one queen size bed. 
MICHAEL: You... are... kidding me. 
STANLEY: A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael. 
MICHAEL: I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight? 
ERIN: Oh. Gross. 
KELLY: Blow my brains out. 
MICHAEL: That's rude. 
TOBY: Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want. 
MICHAEL: You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it. Mr. 
HALPERT: So, which one is Pam's grandma? 
PAM: Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles. 
JIM: Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right? Mr. 
HALPERT: No. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word. 
JIM: Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott. Mr. 
HALPERT: Oh. 
MICHAEL: How ya doin'? Mr. 
HALPERT: Hi. 
MICHAEL: Nice to meet you. Mr. 
HALPERT: Nice to meet you. 
MICHAEL: Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and-- 
JIM: Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think. 
MICHAEL: That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives. 
JIM: Pretty sure everyone heard that. 
MICHAEL: Didn't move my lips. 
PAM: Hey, Mema. 
MEMA: I wasn't sure about your branch of the family. After I heard about your parent's divorce. But you and Jim are just perfect. God bless you. 
PAM: Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect. 
MEMA: Well... I wouldn't care to live if I thought that. 
JIM: Mr. Beesly. How are ya? Mr. 
BEESLY: I'd like you to meet Christy Kelly. 
JIM: Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece? Mr. 
BEESLY:  No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table? 
DWIGHT: From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report. Little 
GIRL: Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter? 
DWIGHT: Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt. 
KIDS: Ewwww! 
DWIGHT: That's right. It is ew. It is very ew. 
PAM: Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor. 
OSCAR: Pleased to meet you. 
PENNY: I'm sorry, it's Kevin. I thought it was Gil? 
KEVIN: She thought I was your boyfriend. 
OSCAR: You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you? 
PAM: Oscar, it was an honest mistake. 
OSCAR: Him? Him? 
KEVIN: Oscar, I would be proud to date you. 
PENNY: I'm sorry. 
KEVIN: I'm not gay. I'm Kevin. 
PENNY: Nice to meet you, Kevin. 
KEVIN: Yes. 
OSCAR: You owe me and apology. 
PENNY: I'm so sorry. 
KEVIN: Are you seeing anyone right now? 
PAM: She has a boyfriend. He's out of town. 
KEVIN: Cool. 
RYAN:  I was the youngest VP in the company history. 
MEREDITH: More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories. 
RYAN: Um... also-- 
ANDY: How did Meredith get put at the young people's table? 
KEVIN: She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin. 
ANDY: What? You're kid-- That's-- You're-- 
ISABEL: Jim and Pam, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here. 
MICHAEL: Head table, where I belong. 
DWIGHT: It's just for family. 
MICHAEL: Well, who's that one? 
DWIGHT: Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her.  In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2. 
MICHAEL: What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight? 
DWIGHT: That's a very good record. 
PETE: Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'. 
TOM: That's when I'll do the face, like- 
PETE: Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and-- 
TOM: A noogie? 
PETE: You know what? Never too married for a noogie. 
MICHAEL: They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom. 
TOM: Pam, you've got the greatest smile and you're body is really fine. 
PETE: Smoking. 
TOM: Hoping it'll make our wives take it up a notch. 
PETE: A little mo' cardio. 
MICHAEL: That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider. 
DWIGHT: Knight Rider. 
MICHAEL: That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope. 
DWIGHT: No. 
MICHAEL: That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.  
DWIGHT: Very smart. 
MICHAEL: And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh. 
JIM: No. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Go ahead. 
JIM: Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming. 
PETE: Douche. 
JIM: Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint.  Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick? 
PAM: Like... a year. 
JIM: I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses-- 
MEMA: What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink? 
JIM: Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant. 
MICHAEL:  Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex-- 
MEMA: They were living together? 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation. 
JIM: Michael. 
MICHAEL: When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation. 
JIM: Oh, my God. Please. 
MICHAEL: When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman-- 
PAM: Michael. 
MICHAEL: ...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok. 
PAM: Michael. Stop. 
MICHAEL: Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word. 
JIM: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Jim. 
JIM: To waiting. 
EVERYONE:  To waiting. 
MEMA: I should have known. The hotels television set had a movie on called "Bruno" last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, I couldn't turn it off. So I had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, 'How could they pick such a hotel?' Hmmm. Now I know. 
PAM: Mema. 
MICHAEL: That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it. 
JIM: I can't believe it was me. 
MICHAEL: I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me. 
JIM: Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things? 
MICHAEL: I have not found that to be the case. 
PAM: Hey, smooth guys. 
JIM: I'm so sorry. 
MICHAEL: Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me. 
PAM: Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning. 
JIM: Oh, my God. Are you serious? 
MICHAEL: There's gonna be a free room? 
MICHAEL: Hi, Mema. It's Michael. 
MEMA: Oh. You're that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I? 
MICHAEL: I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody. 
MEMA: I want to go to bed but I can't. I can't turn that television off. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there.  
MEMA: Oh. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: You're welcome. 
MEMA: It was that horrible Charlie Rose. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life. 
MEMA: People are like cats and dogs these days. 
MICHAEL: Exactly. 
MEMA: This used to be such a great country. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
MEMA: I don't know what happened to it. 
MICHAEL: They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema. 
MEMA: You mean, Sylvia. 
MICHAEL: Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio. 
ANDY: Partay. Room 639. 
KEVIN: Yes! 
ANDY: Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models. 
KEVIN: That sounds epic. Can we bring anything? 
ANDY: Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo! 
ANDY: No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down. 
ANDY: If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come. 
ANGELA: And where do you think you're going? 
PAM: I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit. 
ANGELA: Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead? 
PAM: I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while. 
ANGELA: Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on. 
PAM:  Nevermind. 
ANGELA: Are you sure? 
PAM: Yeah. 
ANGELA: It'll be fun. 
PAM: No. 
MICHAEL: What are you wearing? 
DWIGHT: What? It's a casual, social outfit. 
MICHAEL: Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex. 
MICHAEL: Ok.  That's not appropriate.  Uncool. Uncool, Dwight.  Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go.  
KEVIN: It's a good idea. 
OSCAR: It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece. 
KEVIN: Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice. 
DWIGHT: I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm. 
ISABEL: Wait. You're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have? 
DWIGHT: Nine and three-quarters. 
DWIGHT: I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'. 
MICHAEL:  Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar. 
DWIGHT: Michael. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Drop this one. Abort. 
MICHAEL: Why? 
DWIGHT: I found twins. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you. 
DWIGHT: Aren't they magnificent? 
MICHAEL: They're men, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: I love finding a good set of twins. 
MICHAEL: Something is wrong with you. 
ERIN:  Go Meredith. Nice moves. 
ANDY: You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this. 
KELLY: Lame! What else you got, Andy? 
ANDY: How about a little bit of this. 
ERIN: Oh yeah. What else you got? 
KEVIN: What else you got? 
ANDY: Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo!  
ERIN: What else you got? 
KEVIN: It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here.  Pam?  
ANDY: I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket. 
PAM: What? 
ANDY: I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital. 
PAM: Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours. 
ANDY: Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here. 
PAM:  Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital? 
JIM:  What? 
PAM: He tore his scrotum dancing. 
JIM:  What? 
PAM: He is in my room icing his balls. 
JIM:  What? 
PAM: Please stop saying what. Can you take him? 
JIM: Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted. 
PAM: Your brothers took you out drinking? 
JIM: Uh... 
MICHAEL:  Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly. 
PAM: That's Michael. You're out with Michael? 
JIM:  And Dwight. 
DWIGHT:  Hey-O! 
JIM: Pam, it just happened. 
PAM: Okay, fine. I'll take him. 
JIM: I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go! 
MICHAEL:  I love you!  
PAM: Are you pushing me off the phone? 
JIM: No. Let's talk for a long time. 
PAM: Goodbye.  
MICHAEL: Mmm! It's after midnight.  Michael and 
DWIGHT: You're married.  He's married! 
DWIGHT: Congratulations. 
JIM: That's not how that works. 
DWIGHT: Oh my goodness. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back. 
DWIGHT: You'll have Pam to answer to. 
MICHAEL: She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."  "And... and clip my toenails." 
DWIGHT: "Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV." 
MICHAEL: Now you sound like Kermit. 
ANDY: Are you sure this is the right way? 
PAM: Nope. I, like you, have never been here before. 
ANDY: Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum. 
PAM: Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before. 
ANDY: I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so-- 
PAM: My job? My job is to get married in the morning. That's my job. 
ANDY: Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so-- 
ANDY:  Ow, ow! 
ANDY:  I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom. 
PAM: Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night? 
ANDY: No. No that was real. 
MICHAEL:  Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. God. Can't I get a little privacy? Hotel 
EMPLOYEE:  Good morning. How can I help you? 
KEVIN: I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet. Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: You must be Mr. Malone. One moment please. 
KEVIN: Thank you. Hotel 
EMPLOYEE:  Sir. It's the man with the shoes. Hotel 
MANAGER: Mr. Malone. Your shoes are gone. 
KEVIN: They were stolen? Hotel 
MANAGER: No. Destroyed. 
KEVIN: What? Hotel 
MANAGER: The bag was opened by our shoe shine and the smell overcame him. I too smelled them and made the choice that they must be thrown away. Incinerated actually. 
KEVIN: But that was my only pair of shoes. Hotel 
MANAGER: It became a safety issue, sir. 
KEVIN: Well... well damn-it. Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: I can offer you a complimentary breakfast. 
KEVIN: Okay. 
DWIGHT:  You have everything? 
ISABEL: Hmm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: Cell phone? Charger? 
ISABEL: Yeah. So you sure you don't want breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day. 
DWIGHT: It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel. 
ISABEL: That's really sweet, Dwight. So I'll see you at the wedding? 
DWIGHT: You know it. 
ISABEL: K.  
DWIGHT: Okay, get out of here. 
ISABEL: Bye. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
MICHAEL:  Hey, good morning.  It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.  Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit. 
DWIGHT:  Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots. 
MICHAEL:  How can you eat like that? 
DWIGHT: I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself. 
DWIGHT: Hey, what was she like? 
MICHAEL: She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger. 
DWIGHT: Brides side or grooms side? Or townie? 
MICHAEL: She was from Europe. 
DWIGHT: No kidding. 
MICHAEL: Uh-huh. 
DWIGHT: I bet she had hairy armpits. 
MICHAEL: No. 
DWIGHT: Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere. 
MICHAEL: Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me? 
DWIGHT: No. 
MICHAEL: She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe? 
DWIGHT: Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth. 
MICHAEL: No... you're crazy. 
DWIGHT: Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass. 
MICHAEL: She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it-- 
DWIGHT: You should ask her out. 
MICHAEL:  I already have my European girlfriend. 
STANLEY: If your hat hits me in the face one more time-- 
PHYLLIS: That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it.  
ANGELA:  Oh my God. 
OSCAR: Oh... 
KEVIN: Oscar. Angela. 
ERIN: Are you in a lot of pain? 
ANDY: Oh cause of last night? No way. Reports have been exaggerated. Weddings make me very emotional. I um--I just have that side to me. 
ERIN: People say you cry all the time. 
ANDY: Well that's not-- 
MEREDITH: Crotch injuries are the worst. You don't need to tell me. 
ANDY: I wasn't telling you. 
MEREDITH: Is there still something there? 
ANDY: Excuse me? 
MEREDITH: It didn't get torn off? 
ANDY: No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that? 
JIM: I may have told some people that. I'm nervous. I'm about to get married. 
ERIN: If you want to sit on this--  I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis. Make it softer. 
ANDY: It was my scrotum. Um, and it was. Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me. 
DWIGHT: I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs. 
PENNY: Is it zipping over your belly? Don't squish the baby. 
PAM: Thank you weirdo. Pam's 
MOM: everybody see Kristie's stupid blonde extensions? It's like they were made from a plastic broom. 
PAM: Okay, here I come.  Pam's 
MOM: Oh darling! You look beautiful. 
PAM: Thanks mom. Pam's 
MOM: Oh, I hope he deserves you. 
PAM: He does. Pam's 
MOM: Are you sure? Remember you don't have to do this. You don't. 
PENNY: Mom, you're totally projecting. You're being a drag. 
PAM: Yes. Thank you, mom. 
ISABEL: Hey, I'm going to go outside and talk to Dwight. 
PAM: Okay great.  Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  Wait, what?  Oh! Oh no! 
JIM:  Hey! 
PAM: Can you come here please? 
JIM: Is this allowed? 
PAM: No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here. 
DWIGHT:  That was an intelligent comment. 
ISABEL: Hello stranger. How do I look? 
DWIGHT: Oh. Fine. Isabel,  nice to see you. What do you want? 
ISABEL: Um...  nothing. Anymore. 
DWIGHT:  So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement. 
MICHAEL:  Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy? 
ISABEL: I'm standing. I'm a bridesmaid. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go? 
PAM: Hey. 
JIM: Wow. You look-- 
PAM: Terrible. 
JIM: So beautiful.  Hey-- 
PAM: My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels-- 
JIM:  Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty. 
PAM:  Thank you. 
JIM: And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right? 
PAM: No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and--  
JIM: There. Now we're even.  
PAM:  Everyone's driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people? 
PHYLLIS: I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
OSCAR:  What are you doing? 
KEVIN: I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee. 
OSCAR: How long do you take to pee? 
KEVIN: The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on. 
MICHAEL:  Hey. Hi. Do you--would you have a snack in your purse? You're a mom. I just figured you might have-- Pam's 
MOM: Oh, yeah-- 
MICHAEL: Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or-- Pam's 
MOM: No. 
MICHAEL: Oh... okay. Were you saving it? Pam's 
MOM: Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. I was just--I've had a very rough weekend. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry.  Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes. 
ERIN: Do you think they canceled the wedding? 
ANGELA: Relax. You'll get your shot at Jim. Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party. 
MICHAEL: my weekend was bad so far. Pam's 
MOM: Oh-- 
MICHAEL: I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm. Pam's 
MOM: Oh that sounds awful. 
MICHAEL: And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else. Pam's 
MOM: Oh-- 
MICHAEL: It is a terrible year for love. Pam's 
MOM: Yeah. Guess it is. 
MICHAEL: I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen. Tom 
HALPERT: Excuse me, are you Michael Scott? 
MICHEL: Um, yeah. 
TOM: Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you. Pete 
HALPERT: Sisters in the can and we totally want to get her when she comes back. 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually.  There you go. Use it in good health. Tom and 
PETE:  Yes! 
MEREDITH: Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What is the etiquette on taking the gifts? Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing? 
STANLEY: Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster? 
KEVIN: Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs? 
STANLEY: No. 
KEVIN: Who would want it? 
OSCAR: Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes. 
DWIGHT: Toby. 
TOBY: What? 
DWIGHT: I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour. 
TOBY:  
DWIGHT:  Crap.  Come here you. 
TOBY: Well I guess this weddings not going to happen. I wonder if this is it for them.  Pam's 
DAD: Hey. What happened? 
RYAN: Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here? 
JIM: Well we are here now, so let's just-- 
MICHAEL:  Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look? 
JIM: You look great. 
PAM: You look great. 
TOM:  Wear a tie much? 
PENNY:  I begged them not to. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
PENNY: I know you specifically put this song on your Do Not Play list. 
PAM: Yes I did. 
PENNY: I'm sorry. 
PAM:  Go ahead. I think it's your turn. 
PENNY: Wait, what happened? You're okay with this? 
PAM: Yeah, I'm okay. 
PENNY: Okay then!  
MICHAEL: Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube. 
PAM: Saw it. 
JIM: I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her. 
KEVIN: What an awesome party. The best wedding I've ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic. My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  Whoo. My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold. What a lovely hotel. 
MICHAEL: The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. "Mental" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it. 
TOBY: Well the "fun" is in it.  
MICHAEL: Get out. 
TOBY:  Yeah, I know. 
MICHAEL: Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need "small talk." What topics can you use for small talk? 
ANDY: Golf. 
MICHAEL: Mmhm. 
ANDY: Stock market. 
MICHAEL: Mmhm. 
ANDY: Dave Matthews. 
MICHAEL: Yes, what else? 
CREED: Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes... 
MICHAEL: No. 
MEREDITH: The weekend! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, "So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?" 
MEREDITH: Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet. 
MICHAEL: All right... 
MEREDITH: He calls it an upper decker. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with. 
RYAN: Then do it. 
MICHAEL: What? 
RYAN: Write a book. 
MICHAEL:  The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman... 
ERIN:  Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to. 
MICHAEL: Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec.  Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is? 
ERIN: In your schedule it just says nine til noon is "creative space" and I thought this could be part of that. 
MICHAEL: Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon. 
ERIN: You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says "free play." 
MICHAEL: Push free play til tomorrow morning.  Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made. 
GROTTI: Ah. 
MICHAEL: Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage. 
GROTTI: As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride. 
MICHAEL: Mmhm. 
GROTTI: But you also got a lot of responsibility 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
GROTTI: None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player. 
KEVIN: Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks. 
ANDY: What do you think? 
DWIGHT: I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags. 
GROTTI: God forbid you... should have a fire in the warehouse. 
MICHAEL: Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up. 
GROTTI: Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there's injury. 
MICHAEL: Mmhm, I hear you. The truck. 
GROTTI: You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well. 
GROTTI: I can be very very persistent. 
MICHAEL: Do your worst.  
MICHAEL:  Oh, great. 
GROTTI: Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh? 
MICHAEL: Mmhm. 
ANDY: What happened in there? 
MICHAEL: Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman. 
DWIGHT: Did he threaten you? 
MICHAEL: No Dwight, not everything is a threat. 
ANDY: Mobsters are! 
MICHAEL: There is no such things as monsters. 
ANDY: He drives an SUV! 
DWIGHT: I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space. 
OSCAR: Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob? 
DWIGHT: No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster. 
MICHAEL: Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance. 
ANDY: All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation. 
OSCAR: For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia. 
MICHAEL: I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance. 
ANDY: Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down! 
DWIGHT: Exactly. 
MICHAEL: He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer. 
OSCAR: Uhh. All right, who else is here?  
OSCAR: Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between "sane and others." Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The "coalition for reason" is extremely weak. 
TOBY: Oscar says I checked out huh? Huh.  
MICHAEL:  Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think? 
RYAN: Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.' 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
RYAN: What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name? 
MICHAEL: Um it is, Grotti. Andy and 
DWIGHT:  Oh no. Fabulous. 
OSCAR: What? What? 
ANDY: It's John Gotti, you idiot! 
OSCAR: It's, it's a completely different name! 
PHYLLIS: So he won't get caught! 
ANDY: Yeah. It's pretty close. 
OSCAR: No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it. 
DWIGHT: No I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it "murder." And not "muck-duck." 
MICHAEL: Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences. 
DWIGHT: Lock your door! 
MICHAEL: I'm not gonna lock my door.  
JIM: Hello? 
OSCAR: Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon. 
JIM: Oscar! Uh, what is going on? 
OSCAR: It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this. 
JIM: Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so- 
PAM: Hey Oscar. It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon. 
OSCAR: Pam, I'm sorry-- 
PAM: Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us. 
OSCAR: You're right. You're right.  Oh, okay bye. 
MICHAEL: It's Grotti. He's following up. 
ANDY: Already? This, this guy is persistent! 
MICHAEL:  "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business." 
DWIGHT: That's bad. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: That's bad. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or? 
ANDY: Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I'm calling the police. 
ANDY:  That is the stupidest thing you could do right now! 
DWIGHT: He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
ANDY: Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed! 
MICHAEL: Shh! 
DWIGHT: You know what? 
MICHAEL: That's not gonna happen. 
DWIGHT: That's an exaggeration. 
ANDY: That's how it works! 
MICHAEL: What am I supposed to do here? 
ANDY: When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back 
MICHAEL: I was thinking exactly the same thing. 
DWIGHT: No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat. 
ANDY: Dwight... 
DWIGHT: The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people. 
MICHAEL: I don't know, I don't know about that. 
ANDY: Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting. 
DWIGHT: Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent. 
ANDY: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous. 
ANDY:  I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan. 
MICHAEL: Hold on, hold on! Just- 
ANDY: No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way. 
MICHAEL: All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone. 
ANDY: Well you're gonna have to.  
DWIGHT: We'll be right beside you. 
ANDY: What? 
MICHAEL:  What are you wearing? Who's Pat? 
ANDY: Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing. 
DWIGHT: Do you know how to use it? 
ANDY: To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it. 
MICHAEL: Let's go, come on.  God! 
ANDY: Should I change? 
DWIGHT: You're wearing loafers! 
MICHAEL: Forget it! Forget it! 
MICHAEL:  Take that thing off the table! Please! 
ANDY: Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it. 
DWIGHT: Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel. 
ANDY: Oh! God!  
MICHAEL: Oh my God! 
DWIGHT: You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax- 
MICHAEL: Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is. 
MICHAEL: Hello. 
GROTTI: Mr. Scott. 
MICHAEL: Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates. 
GROTTI: Hi. Angelo Grotti. 
ANDY: Hi. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
GROTTI: So, you got this table? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
GROTTI: This is one of those half booths, can't-decide-what-it-is type of thing. 
MICHAEL: Well. 
GROTTI: Waitress, we're gonna sit over here. 
WAITRESS: That's fine. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
KEVIN:  Hello. Credit card 
REP: Hello Mr. Halpert. I'm calling from the identity theft department at Capital One. We've detected some unusual activity on your credit card. 
KEVIN: Oh man, do you think it was stolen? 
REP: First would you mind verifying your home address? 
KEVIN: Um, yes.  Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA 
REP: And may I have the last four numbers of your Social Security Number? 
KEVIN: Six-six-five-zero. 
REP: Well Mr. Halpert. You're obviously not in San Juan Puerto Rico. 
KEVIN: Wait a minute. Yes I am. 
REP: I'm going to go ahead and put a hold on your card. 
KEVIN: No. That... I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer. 
REP: Very funny sir. We'll get a new card out to you right away. 
KEVIN: No- 
REP: Have a nice day, and thank you! 
KEVIN: Shoot. 
GROTTI: If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy. 
DWIGHT: Oh he's not that nice. 
MICHAEL: That's not true. 
ANDY: Hmm. Very true. 
MICHAEL: Okay shut up. 
WAITRESS: Have you decided? 
GROTTI: Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back. 
WAITRESS: Okay then. And for you sir? 
MICHAEL: I will have the gabba-gool. 
WAITRESS: The... what? 
MICHAEL: The gabba-gool. 
WAITRESS: I don't really know what that is. 
ANDY:  You know, gabba-gool. 
MICHAEL: I don't, I don't have to have that. 
DWIGHT: What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool. 
MICHAEL: Guys, guys- 
WAITRESS: I don't really think that we have that. 
MICHAEL: That's okay. 
DWIGHT: Bring him the gabba-gool! 
MICHAEL: Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad. 
WAITRESS: Okay. 
MICHAEL: If the salad is on top, I send it back. 
OSCAR: Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards? 
KEVIN: I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone. 
OSCAR: This constitutes identity fraud. 
KEVIN: Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you. 
OSCAR: What's that supposed to mean? 
KEVIN: Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail. 
OSCAR: Why would I love jail? 
KEVIN: Because... You would love it. 
MICHAEL: I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out. 
GROTTI: Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you. 
ANDY: Maybe we have a plan for you? 
GROTTI: How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt! You always think, it can't happen to you, and  Think about it. 
WOMAN:  Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic? 
ANDY: Yeeeeah. 
WOMAN: My battery is dead, I've got my kid, can you please help? 
ANDY: Yes I can. 
MICHAEL: No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad. 
GROTTI: Come on! Lady in distress? Go! Go! 
ANDY: Okay! 
WOMAN: Thank you so much, I really appreciate it. 
MICHAEL: Hey, do you need any help? 
GROTTI: I'm sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down. 
MICHAEL: He's a good mechanic. 
GROTTI: Where were we? 
MICHAEL: I don't... 
DWIGHT: He was trying to force you to decide on a policy. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay okay. 
DWIGHT: So we're choosing... 
MICHAEL: Yep, all right. 
DWIGHT: Check out Dental? 
MICHAEL: Put it down. 
ANDY: Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down. 
KID: He seems bad at this. 
ANDY: You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store.  Aaaah! You got a leaky spark tube. 
WOMAN: What?!? 
ANDY: So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles.  
GROTTI: Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion.  You okay, Pat? 
ANDY: Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of. 
GROTTI: Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car? 
ANDY: It was before, my tech- my technical training. 
DWIGHT: Don't do it! 
ANDY: Do it. 
DWIGHT: Don't. 
ANDY: Just do it. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
GROTTI: Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow? 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DWIGHT: I don't understand, why would you buy a policy? 
MICHAEL: It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour. 
ANDY: You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you. 
MICHAEL: I had to make a snap decision Dwight. 
DWIGHT: It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour. 
MICHAEL: It was a lot of snap decisions. 
DWIGHT: Do you know what "snap decision" means? 
MICHAEL: Yes! 
DWIGHT: It means like this.  
MICHAEL: Just get in the car. 
JIM: Hello? 
MICHAEL: Jim? 
JIM: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Oh thank God. 
JIM: How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran. 
MICHAEL: It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier. 
JIM: That sounds bad. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend. 
JIM: I'm gonna help you through it all right? 
MICHAEL: Okay! 
JIM: All you're gonna need to  and- it- and then go to-- 
MICHAEL: Jim? Are you? 
JIM: And then you'll be saved. 
MICHAEL: What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said. 
JIM: Just  and then you'll be saved. 
MICHAEL: No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again! 
JIM: A- ah-- 
MICHAEL: No! Oh my God! 
JIM: And you'll be saved. 
MICHAEL: No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you! 
JIM: I  at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don't call again. 
MICHAEL: Jim?!?  Oh my God. 
MICHAEL: Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away? 
OSCAR: Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it. 
MICHAEL: Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing? 
OSCAR: Just- no. No. 
MICHAEL: All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks. 
DWIGHT: We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault. 
ANDY: He's alive. So you're welcome. 
DWIGHT: Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job. 
ANDY: Yeah, some of that existed before. 
DWIGHT: Not the living in fear, that's new. 
ANDY: You're right, that is new. 
DWIGHT: Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy. 
ANDY: Well I don't see that happening. 
DWIGHT: Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy? 
ANDY: Are you saying- 
DWIGHT: Yeah... 
ANDY: That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain? 
DWIGHT: What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia! 
ANDY: That seems a little far-fetched. 
DWIGHT: Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened. 
DWIGHT: Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean. 
MICHAEL: No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works. 
ANDY: No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean. 
DWIGHT: It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really. 
ANDY: Class act. Boy scout. 
MICHAEL: But Grotti acts like he's mafia though. 
ANDY: He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman. 
DWIGHT: And he made us all look like chumps! 
MICHAEL:  
MICHAEL: If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden. 
GROTTI: This is Grotti. 
MICHAEL: This is Scott. 
GROTTI: Oh! Great. Michael, I'm finishing up your paperwork right now. 
MICHAEL: Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me? 
GROTTI: I, I thought you'd be pleased. 
MICHAEL: Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd. 
GROTTI: What? 
MICHAEL: I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance. 
GROTTI: I don't get it. How was I scaring you? 
MICHAEL: I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk. 
ANDY: Whoa. Okay. 
MICHAEL: You suck! 
DWIGHT: Okay that's- 
MICHAEL: And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance. 
DWIGHT: That's good, let's wrap it up. 
MICHAEL: How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it? 
GROTTI: Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give me a call? 
MICHAEL: Doubt it.  Dwight and 
ANDY:  Oh man. 
MICHAEL: What a tool.  What? 
ANDY: Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia! 
MICHAEL: No. What do you mean? 
DWIGHT: We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared. 
MICHAEL: What? 
DWIGHT: You successfully backed down the mob! 
ANDY: You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite! 
MICHAEL: Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not. 
MICHAEL: So I looked him in the eye and I said, "Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead." I said something like that. 
DWIGHT: Very close. 
OSCAR: Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg. 
MICHAEL: Erin? 
ERIN: Yes? 
MICHAEL: Coffee? 
ERIN: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back. 
ERIN: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back. 
ERIN: How do you return coffee? 
MICHAEL: Go. Any questions? 
PAM:  Are you kidding me? 
KEVIN: Hi Pam, is Jim there? 
PAM: Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here! 
KEVIN: Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi. 
PAM: Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority. 
KEVIN: Cool. Okay.  Bye. 
KEVIN: They have no idea what happened. 
ERIN: They're back! 
KEVIN: Oooh yeah...  Jim and Pam! 
KELLY: How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic? 
JIM: It was. 
PAM: It really was. 
JIM: Really was. 
KELLY:  I'm so happy for you... 
JIM: Puerto Rico was awesome. 
PAM: Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot. 
JIM:  Frank and Beans.  Always makes her laugh. 
PAM:  Frank and beans! 
MICHAEL: Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there? 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind. 
DWIGHT: Its Jim and Pam, Michael. 
MICHAEL:  It is? 
DWIGHT: Yeah... 
MICHAEL: They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam!  
JIM: Nope. 
MICHAEL: And oh, Jim... 
PAM: Hi, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy. 
MICHAEL: Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him.  
MEREDITH: So what'd you bring us? 
PAM: Some candy. 
MEREDITH: What else? 
PAM: That's it. 
MEREDITH: Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding. 
MICHAEL:  
PAM: It's good to be home. 
DWIGHT: This conversation has two items on the agenda. 
JIM: Do we have a conversation scheduled? 
DWIGHT: Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say...  con-quack-ulations! 
JIM: Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you. 
DWIGHT:  You're welcome!  
DWIGHT: I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing. 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years. 
JIM: It's a real handsome duck. 
DWIGHT: Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair. 
PAM: Hey! 
ERIN: Hi! 
PAM: Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy. 
ERIN: Coco Leche! That's my favorite! 
PAM: Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it. 
ERIN: Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first. 
PAM:  I think it'll be okay. 
ERIN:  I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though. 
PAM: Great. 
ERIN: Oops, sorry.  Oops. 
MICHAEL: I have recently taken a lover. 
JIM: Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady? 
MICHAEL: Pam's mom. 
JIM: What? 
MICHAEL: Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding? 
JIM: You're messing with me. 
MICHAEL: About what? 
JIM: You did not have sex with Pam's mom. 
MICHAEL: Oh, big time. 
JIM: What kind of car does she drive? 
MICHAEL: She drives a green camry. 
JIM:  
MICHAEL: And the seats go all the way down. All the way down. 
JIM: Oh my God.  Oh my God. 
MICHAEL:  What? 
JIM: Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly- 
MICHAEL: Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright? 
JIM: Oh my God. 
TOBY:  Hey, Jim. 
JIM: Not now, Toby, my God! 
TOBY: Oh, Jesus! 
MICHAEL: Get the hell out of here, idiot. 
TOBY: What did I do? 
JIM: Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again. 
MICHAEL: I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy. 
JIM: No, not more than anything. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I have a good thing with the mom- 
JIM: Don't call her "the mom." 
MICHAEL: She's right on my way home from work. 
JIM: Then take a different way home, man! 
MICHAEL: I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam. 
JIM: Okay, so we're good. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two? 
ERIN: Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico? 
MICHAEL: Sure. Thanks for asking. 
ERIN: Pam, we're all set.  Yum. 
JIM: Frank and beans! 
PAM: Frank and beans!  So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock? 
JIM: You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide? 
PAM: Bottle of rum it is.  Alright, shall we? 
JIM: You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy. 
PAM: Come on, it'll take two seconds. 
JIM: No, it-  
MICHAEL:  Oh, wow. 
PAM:  
MICHAEL: That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican. 
ERIN: Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people. 
MICHAEL: Erin, look.  
ERIN: Fun! 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
PAM: Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, no, it's nobody. 
PAM:  I don't know. I think Michael has a date. 
MICHAEL:  Hmm... no. 
PAM:  I think you have a date. 
MICHAEL: I don't. 
PAM: Come on. 
JIM: Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it. 
MICHAEL:  I don't deserve this, guys. 
JIM: Yes, you do. 
MICHAEL: No, I don't. 
JIM: Just take the parrot. 
MICHAEL:  
JIM: Okay, back to the old grind. 
MICHAEL: I was probably going to break up with her anyway. 
PAM: Oh, that's too bad. 
JIM: Don't- 
MICHAEL: Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here. 
JIM: Sounds complicated. 
MICHAEL: It is. 
PAM: Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes. 
MICHAEL: You want me to be happy? 
PAM: Of course. 
MICHAEL: Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine. 
PAM: Oh. 
MICHAEL: More than a friend, a co-worker. 
PAM: Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who? 
MICHAEL: It's okay. 
PAM: No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo! 
MICHAEL: That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset. 
PAM:  
DWIGHT:  You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills? 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DWIGHT: There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down... 
MICHAEL:  Feels good. 
DWIGHT: There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down... 
MICHAEL: I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner. 
DWIGHT: ...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine. 
PAM:  How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy! 
JIM:  Who wants a hot chocolate? 
PAM: Thank you. 
JIM:  Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure. 
PAM: You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott. 
JIM: Andy, can I talk to you for a second? 
ANDY: Sure thing, Tuna Boss. 
JIM:  
ANDY:  How may I be of service to you? 
JIM: I am gonna need your advice  I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think? 
ANDY:  This aurea is a joke. 
JIM: Really? 
ANDY: What are you thinking? 
JIM: I was gonna go with this one. 
ANDY:  Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better. 
DWIGHT:  The Nard Dog... what was that all about? 
ANDY: I know, right? 
DWIGHT: What were you talking about in there? 
ANDY: Trust me it would only make you mad.  
MICHAEL:  Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities. 
ANDY: Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill? 
MICHAEL: That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own. 
PAM: Haha! Ha ha ha. 
JIM: And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  
MICHAEL: Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  Alright, good. 
DWIGHT: Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself. 
MICHAEL: Alright, that's... 
MEREDITH: Paint a mural of Chicano leaders. 
MICHAEL: Alright... 
PAM: I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  
MICHAEL: Okay, I'm out of here,  see you later guys... 
VARIOUS: Get out and stay out, bye... 
MICHAEL: Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation... 
PAM: I love it, conservation. Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.  No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings!  
MICHAEL: Anybody else? Who else has an idea? 
ANGELA: I have some ideas about conservation... 
JIM: Yes! Angela! Please... 
MICHAEL:  Can you hold down the fort?  Hey boo! 
ANGELA: Thank you. Sure well first of all I think that we could totally... 
MICHAEL:  What's it... why are you crying? 
JIM: Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder... 
KEVIN:  Shhhh... 
ANGELA: Well, for our profit... 
KEVIN:  Shhh... 
MICHAEL:  No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle. 
KEVIN: Who's pickle? 
MICHAEL:  Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now. 
ANGELA: I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor. 
JIM: Yes. 
OSCAR: Hold on, hold on, what's going on? 
JIM: Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good! 
PAM: I'm not apologizing to anyone. Michael owes me an apology. 
MICHAEL: For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover? 
PAM: Don't call my mother your lover. 
KEVIN: Yes! That's what I'm talking about. 
ANDY: That is not okay dude. 
MICHAEL: Alright, in my defense... 
PHYLLIS: Disgusting... 
CREED: She's messed up man... 
PAM: Yes! Thank you, welcome to my personal hell! 
OSCAR: You have no sense of boundaries Michael. 
MICHAEL: Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual. Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness. 
PHYLLIS: Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for. 
OSCAR: Maybe you're right, who are we to... 
PAM: Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother! 
DWIGHT: I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on. 
MICHAEL: Let's get back to the matter at hand. 
PAM: Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom... 
MICHAEL: No, no, no... no, no... 
RYAN: Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about... 
MICHAEL: I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it. 
PAM: Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous! 
MICHAEL: Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out. 
PAM: You are never going to be my father, you get out! 
MICHAEL: I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am... 
PAM: Me too... 
PAM: Hey.  
OSCAR: Hey. 
ANGELA:  Pam, how's your day going? 
OSCAR: Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions. 
PAM: Oh, well, thanks Oscar. I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom? 
OSCAR: My mother's in a wheelchair. 
PAM: Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page. 
KELLY:  Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question. Do you think that I should get a Fedora? 
RYAN: Ahh, I don't think so, no... 
KELLY: Well, I think I'd look really hot in one. Where'd you get your fedora? 
RYAN: I'd rather not say. 
KELLY: I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you. 
ERIN: Hi Dwight! 
DWIGHT:  Shh! 
RYAN:  ...it should go with the persona you already have. 
KELLY: Well, I think I have that persona. 
DWIGHT: Where did you get that mallard? 
KELLY: What the hell is a mallard? 
DWIGHT: That! 
KELLY: Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back. 
KELLY: If you take it back, I'll scream. 
DWIGHT:  I'll give you five bucks for it. 
RYAN: Twenty. 
DWIGHT: Ten. 
RYAN: Deal.  
KELLY:  You're so cool. 
RYAN: This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas. 
MICHAEL:  Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute? 
TOBY: Yeah, sure, what's up? 
MICHAEL: Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry. 
TOBY: Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot. Thank you for saying it. 
MICHAEL: Can I sit down for a second? 
TOBY: Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder. 
MICHAEL: This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation. 
TOBY: Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place. 
MICHAEL: She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here. 
TOBY: Ok, I mean, I could talk to her. 
MICHAEL: Really? Would you do that? 
TOBY: Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.  
MICHAEL:  You're a good, good guy. 
TOBY: I'm good... 
TOBY: You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends. 
TOBY:  Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec? 
PAM: Sure, what's up? 
TOBY: Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution. 
PAM:  What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles? 
MICHAEL: No... that's... 
TOBY: Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know... 
PAM:  Oh, would that make you feel better? 
MICHAEL: I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation. 
PAM: You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving. 
TOBY:  Buddy, I think that... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  Hey, hey, you know what? You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it. 
STANLEY: Heh, heh, heh. 
PAM: Michael, you're just her rebound! 
MICHAEL: You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her. 
PAM:  What! You knew? 
JIM: Barely, I... I don't have all the facts. Frank and Bean... 
MICHAEL:  Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will. 
PAM: Mmmmm, yes! 
MICHAEL: Well, that is not gonna happen! 
PAM: Then why'd you even offer!? 
MICHAEL: Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy. 
PAM: Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness! Stop dating my mother! 
MICHAEL: You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder. 
PAM: What's that supposed to mean? 
MICHAEL: You know what it means. 
JIM:  Hey... 
PAM: Shut it! 
JIM: Yep... 
MICHAEL: I don't need to be friends with Pam. I have plenty of female friends. My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week. 
JIM:  Dwight, you brought the mallard back. 
DWIGHT: Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even... 
JIM:  Hi buddy. 
DWIGHT:  I'm sorry. 
JIM: A wooden duck? 
DWIGHT: Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me. 
JIM: Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage... 
DWIGHT: Oh, I'm equipped... I can... 
JIM: Silence. 
DWIGHT: Don't tell Michael... 
JIM: I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car. 
DWIGHT: Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  
MICHAEL:  Night everyone. Night Pam, thanks again for the rum. 
ERIN: Night Michael. 
MICHAEL: Night Erin. 
JIM:  Hey Pam, can I see you for a second? So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day. So he generously offered to wash our car. 
PAM:  Awww, he did that for me? 
JIM: Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay. 
PAM: Mmmm. 
JIM:  Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam? 
PAM: Haha, yeah. Say more nice things. 
JIM: Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans! 
PAM: Maybe I'm overreacting. 
JIM: Yeah... maybe. 
PAM: But I don't think I am. 
JIM: You're not, nope. Nope. 
KEVIN:  Oh... where'd you get that hat? 
RYAN: I'd rather not say. 
DWIGHT:   "We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our..."  I've got eight hours of this. Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe. Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard? I'm not insane.  "...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer." 
MICHAEL: Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community. 
KIDS: YAY! 
MICHAEL: Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  ... ha ha ha. 
JIM: We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company. 
MICHAEL: I am going to scare these kids so bad. 
DARRYL: This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look.  Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim. 
ANGELA: Black widow. 
KELLY: Lulu from The Fifth Element. 
DARRYL: Nobody told me what people were, alright? So... label yourselves or take what you get. 
CREED: I want to sell your blood! 
RYAN: That's really not the trend in vampires right now. 
DARRYL: Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell. 
MEREDITH: I'm a hobo. 
DARRYL: I asked for a list.  ...and a clown. 
DWIGHT: I'm Jigsaw, idiot. 
DARRYL: You're not as scary as Book Face, over there. 
JIM: Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face. 
DARRYL: Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy! 
KIDS: Yeah!  
MICHAEL: Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright? 
MICHAEL: Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message? 
MICHAEL: It is the easy way out. You are not alone. 
DARRYL: What the hell is wrong with you? 
MICHAEL: Who wants candy? 
MICHAEL: ...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival. 
JIM: Wow. 
MICHAEL: Sounds like fun. You guys would love it. 
JIM: I bet we would. 
MICHAEL: They have a TCBY booth. 
JIM: Cool. 
MICHAEL: The same stuff you get downtown. 
JIM: Mmm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Do you like TCBY? 
JIM: Who doesn't? 
MICHAEL: I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun 
ERIN: I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour. 
JIM: Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me. 
ERIN: They said the both of you. 
JIM: That is a mistake. 
MICHAEL: You should give them a call. Check that out. 
JIM: Alright. Let's clear this up.  Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem? 
MICHAEL: Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional? 
JIM: Great. See ya' then. 
MICHAEL: Wha- what? 
JIM: They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along. 
MICHAEL: Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand. 
JIM: I absolutely don't understand, either. 
MICHAEL: I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright. 
JIM: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Let me get your stroller. 
JIM: Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right? 
MICHAEL: What are you gonna call him? 
JIM: Dave. 
MICHAEL: No. What is his name? 
JIM: Dave. 
MICHAEL: Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal. 
JIM: Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing? 
JIM: Yes, it is. 
MICHAEL: ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that. 
JIM: No thanks. 
MICHAEL: They are into style. 
JIM: Mmm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: They are into appearance. We are selling success. 
JIM: ...and paper. 
MICHAEL: That's sorta secondary.  
JIM: Nope. No. 
JIM: He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me. 
PAM: Here we are outside- 
ANDY: WB! 
PAM: - the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park. 
ANDY: Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls. 
PAM: The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them. 
ANDY:  Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202. 
PAM: Here it is.  Suite 401. 
ANDY: Yeah. I was gonna sing that part. 
PAM: I know. Now you don't have to. 
ANDY: Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling.  Suite 401. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Hi. Any messages? 
ERIN: You're soaking wet. 
MICHAEL: Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning. 
PHYLLIS: Wow. Sounds scary. 
MICHAEL: It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't. 
ANGELA: Why isn't Jim wet? 
JIM: I outran it. 
MEREDITH: I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing. 
MICHAEL: It rained. 
DWIGHT: Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa? 
MICHAEL: Nothing. Cocoa. 
JIM: I'll just leave that suit in your office then. 
MICHAEL: Good. Yep. 
SECRETARY: Must be nice to have company on these cold calls. 
ANDY: We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio.  
SECRETARY: How exciting! Do you guys know the sex yet? 
PAM:  Oh. No, no.  We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together. 
ANDY:  Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies. 
ERIN:  Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Thank you. 
STANLEY: Did you say 'Koi pond'? 
MICHAEL:  Yeah? 
ERIN: Michael, people are asking questions. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on? 
PHYLLIS: Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond? 
MICHAEL: Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection. 
OSCAR: Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond? 
JIM: Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else. 
MICHAEL: It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing. 
ANGELA: So you fell in? 
MICHAEL: No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in. 
ANGELA: So a child had fallen in? 
MICHAEL: Not yet! 
KEVIN: That is hilarious.  
MICHAEL: No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying.  
JIM: Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out. 
PAM: And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area. 
CUSTOMER: Well that sounds like a really nice deal. 
ANDY: Sha-bow. 
CUSTOMER: And I must say, that since we are a family business it is nice to see that you are, too. 
ANDY: Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not. 
CUSTOMER: My mistake. Sorry. 
PAM: It's ok. 
ANDY: Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine. 
CUSTOMER: That- that's good for you. 
PAM: Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes. 
ANDY: Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam. Doesn't matter what Pam looks like. 
PAM: Yeah. 
PAM: You were way meaner to me than I was to you. 
ANDY: No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich. 
PAM: You blew the sale, you idiot. 
ANDY: Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale. 
MICHAEL: Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together? 
ERIN: Staples?  Uh, David Wallace called. 
MICHAEL: Oh. He did? What did he say? 
ERIN: He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
KEVIN:  I'm gonna kill you. 
STANLEY: Michael, don't listen to them. 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Stanley. 
STANLEY: You just ignore their carp. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
DWIGHT: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
DWIGHT: A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay. 
CREED: Hey, boss, did you find Nemo? 
MICHAEL: I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story. 
OSCAR: Don't you mean 'Koi Story'? 
PHYLLIS: And when you fell in, did you flounder? 
DWIGHT: Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and - 
MICHAEL: I know what a flounder is. 
MICHAEL: I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good. 
MICHAEL: The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis? 
PHYLLIS: Michael, you make fun of us every day. 
MICHAEL: Uh... 
KEVIN: Yeah. Every single day. 
MICHAEL: You never said anything. 
MEREDITH: Uh, we have. Countless times. 
MICHAEL: Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!' 
ANGELA: That's never the case. 
MICHAEL: We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right?  Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on. 
DWIGHT: I don't want people making fun of my nose. 
MICHAEL: Your nose? 
DWIGHT: It's too small. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
OSCAR: Oh my. That is small. 
DWIGHT: Just, write it down, please. 
OSCAR: Can you breathe okay? 
KELLY: What keeps your glasses on? 
DWIGHT: Hey! It's on the list, everybody. 
MICHAEL: No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance. 
KEVIN: I don't want people making fun of my weight. 
MICHAEL: Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah?  Meredith? 
MEREDITH: I don't want to say it out loud. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away. 
MEREDITH: I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do?  
MICHAEL: Ok. 
ANDY: That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it. Keena 
GIFFORD: Well, you two are quite the salesmen and a very cute couple. 
ANDY: Well- 
PAM: Oh-  Thank you. Keena 
GIFFORD: Some couples don't seem like a good match. You two do. 
PAM: Well, you know. 
ANDY: Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook- 
PAM: He loves to eat. 
ANDY: I love to dance- 
PAM: I love to watch him dance. 
ANDY: Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room- 
PAM: And I'll just watch him. Keena 
GIFFORD: And a baby on the way? You must be so excited. 
PAM: Yes. 
ANDY: Yeah. We are thrilled. 
PAM: Mmm-hmm. 
ANDY: In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey? 
PAM: It was, sweetie. Keena 
GIFFORD: Oh. I know the best teacher. Her name is Miss Janet. 
ANDY: Yeah. On Clearview Avenue. Keena 
GIFFORD: Yeah! 
ANDY: Yeah. 
ANGELA: This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel. 
PHYLLIS: So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal? 
ERIN: Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died.  
MICHAEL: It's a fish. 
ERIN: They want you to pay for it. 
MICHAEL: It could've died of natural causes. So... 
ERIN: Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer. 
OSCAR: When is the funeral? 
MICHAEL: Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want? 
ERIN: $300. 
MICHAEL: What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm. 
CREED: Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy? 
JIM: Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it. 
MICHAEL: No, no. 
DWIGHT: Thank you.  
MICHAEL: No. We are not done here. This- 
ANDY: One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick! Keena 
GIFFORD: That's great! 
ANDY: Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me. 
PAM: Yeah, well, that'll happen. 
ANDY: Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too.  
PAM: Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting. 
ANDY: Message received, little soy bean. 
JIM: I think you just gotta ride this one out, man. 
MICHAEL: No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'. 
JIM: No, they don't. 
MICHAEL: Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail. 
JIM: Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away. 
MICHAEL: I want to make fun of you right now. 
JIM: Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball. 
MICHAEL: No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid. 
JIM: See? 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God. 
MICHAEL: Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much?  Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to. 
PHYLLIS: Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby? 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem. 
DWIGHT: Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself. 
MICHAEL: It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing.  No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse.  Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think.  Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice. 
KEVIN:  Enjoying your nut? 
OSCAR: Kevin. 
ANGELA: Why? 
KEVIN: I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut. 
ANGELA: I was. 
MICHAEL: Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over. 
JIM: Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so... 
KEVIN: We'll stay late. 
ANDY: Well, that went pretty well. 
PAM: Yeah, I guess. 
ANDY: We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it. 
PAM: If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss. 
ANDY: You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much. 
PAM: Yeah. Way too much. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
PAM: I mean, what the hell was that? 
ANDY: What the heck was that? 
PAM: When you cried? 
ANDY: Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy. 
PAM: You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes? 
ANDY: No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right? 
PAM: Hmm. 
ANDY: I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single. 
PAM: Well, are you dating anyone? 
ANDY: What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool. 
PAM: Ah. 
ANDY: You think I can do better? 
PAM: Ah. 
ANDY: Gotta get my goin' out on. 
MEREDITH: Hey, let's watch this thing. 
JIM: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this. 
OSCAR: How can we not watch this? 
JIM: What happened to 'Do Not Mock'? 
PHYLLIS: We're not mocking, we're watching. 
JIM: That will inevitably lead to mocking. So... 
PHYLLIS: Well, we'll deal with it as it comes. 
MICHAEL: Is this the tape of me falling? 
PHYLLIS: Yes. Put the DVD in. 
KEVIN: Open QuickTime. 
OSCAR: It starts on it's own. Let it - 
KEVIN: No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this. 
JIM: Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it. 
MICHAEL: No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you. 
JIM: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: It's alright. I can handle it. 
JIM: No. 
MICHAEL: I am a grown-up, Jim. 
MEREDITH: Shh. It's on. 
KEVIN: Here they come.  Boom! 
OSCAR: Oh. Did - did you see that? 
JIM: See what? 
ANGELA: Why'd you stop it? 
JIM: Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it. 
OSCAR: Jim, you let Michael fall in. 
DWIGHT: Play it again.  He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in. 
JIM: Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze. 
MICHAEL: I don't think you froze. 
JIM: It's a killer new dance move.  Do you wanna talk in your office? 
ANGELA: No. 
JIM: I didn't ask you.  Would you like to talk?  
DWIGHT: Judas. 
DWIGHT: Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But- 
JIM: I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job. 
MICHAEL: Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me. 
MEREDITH:  Hey, what's up lifeguard? 
OSCAR: Jim, I think I'm in your way.  
MICHAEL: Oscar's a douche. 
JIM:  He's alright. 
MICHAEL: No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok.  
JIM: Thanks Michael. 
MICHAEL: You're welcome. Whoa!  Almost fell.  
PAM: Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me? 
ERIN: Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them. 
PAM: Ok. 
ERIN: Thanks. 
PAM: Mmm-hmm. 
ERIN: How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales? 
PAM: No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool. 
ERIN: Yeah, he is! 
PAM: Yeah, he is. 
ERIN: He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met. 
PAM: That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando. 
ERIN: Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is. 
PAM: I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Good morning everybody. Who would like an authentic New York bagel? Hmmm? Stanley? 
STANLEY: Thank you.  
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you. 
ANDY: Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels? 
DWIGHT: Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them? 
PHYLLIS: This is really nice Dwight, thanks. 
ANDY: Thanks. 
DWIGHT: Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one. 
DWIGHT: Good morning Michael. 
MICHAEL: Morning Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Hungry? 
MICHAEL: No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs. 
DWIGHT: Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac. 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah... 
DWIGHT: You're thinking of deer penis. 
MICHAEL: It worked. 
DWIGHT: Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  Bagel? 
MICHAEL: I don't mind if I do. 
DWIGHT: K. I brought cheese too. 
MICHAEL: I'm taking one for my lady friend. 
DWIGHT: Excellent. 
MICHAEL: Brain food. Thank you very much. 
DWIGHT: Okay.  You owe me. 
DWIGHT: Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical? 
DWIGHT: Pam, would you care for a bagel? 
PAM: Oh, no thank you. 
DWIGHT: That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel. 
PAM: I have an early lunch. 
PAM: Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don't know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out. 
ERIN: These are amazing. You took all these? 
RYAN: I've always found beauty in uncommon places. Homeless people. Graffiti. Photography lets me capture all that. Have you ever been photographed before? 
ERIN: Oh just by like friends. 
RYAN: Well here's what I've been doing around here. It's for a series on exposure in the workplace. 
HELENE:  Whoohoo! Pammy? 
PAM: Hey!  Hey. Happy birthday. 
HELENE: Thank you.  
MICHAEL:  My girls. There they are.  
MICHAEL: Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your "Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I don't really see them together". So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food. 
ANGELA: Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend? 
PAM: I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding. 
MICHAEL: Yeah-- 
KEVIN: Hi. 
MICHAEL: I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we? 
HELENE: Wait a minute.  Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace. 
KELLY: Oh my God I love it.  
HELENE: Tell her how you gave it to me. 
MICHAEL: No, that wouldn't be-- 
HELENE: He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning. What a nice way to wake up. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity. 
KEVIN: Because of sex? 
MICHAEL: Hey-- 
PAM: Kevin! 
MICHAEL: Please, Kevin. You're fired.  Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go? 
PAM: Yes, let's go.  
ERIN: Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent. 
PAM: Oh, you guys. Just one second.  Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch. 
JIM: Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too. 
PAM: I know. Isn't that always how it goes? 
JIM: Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them. 
PAM: I want to handle it. 
JIM: That's okay. 
PAM: I feel like its-- 
JIM: It's my pleasure.  Hello? Well that's great.  Turns out the paper was there all along. 
CREED:  Thank God. 
CREED: Something's up. That paper was never supposed to arrive. 
HELENE: So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales? 
PAM: Yeah-- it's exciting. 
HELENE: Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales. 
JIM: Pam's sales are fine actually. 
MICHAEL: Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today. 
PAM: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Today is about family. 
PAM: Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it. 
ANDY: Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you. 
DWIGHT: Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it. 
ANDY: Yes!  And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory. 
DWIGHT: Wow-- 
ANDY: Feel it against your cheek. 
DWIGHT: I will.  
ANDY: You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness. 
DWIGHT: Let me get that door for you--  
ANDY: Whoa-- 
DWIGHT: There you go! 
ANDY: Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you.  
DWIGHT: Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees. 
ANDY: Is that right? 
DWIGHT: Observe.  
ANDY: Huh.  
DWIGHT: Right? 
ANDY: That really works. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay. 
ANDY: Hey-- oh, hold on a second. Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus. 
DWIGHT:  And that needs to be straight as an arrow. 
ANDY: Whoa-- thank you very much.  Oh boy. 
DWIGHT: Thank you very much for that. 
ANDY:  You are very welcome. 
DWIGHT:  Have a seat. Allow me. 
ANDY:  Have a seat yourself. 
DWIGHT: You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse. 
ANDY: Not necessary. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no!  
ANDY: You didn't have to do that. 
DWIGHT: Andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game. 
MICHAEL: Hello. Scott. Table for four. 
HOSTESS: Welcome Scott family. It'll be just a moment. 
PAM: I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too. 
MICHAEL: What table should we take? So many to choose from. 
JIM: Wow. 
HELENE:  Oh my God! 
MICHAEL: What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow! 
PAM: Michael, you did all this? 
MICHAEL: Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it. 
HELENE: Well, thank you. All of you. 
MICHAEL: Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day. 
HELENE: Oh you'll love it. You can have my guide books. I think I'm done with those really long plane rides. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books. 
PAM: So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year? 
HELENE:  Sticking with 49. 
PAM: 49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition. 
MICHAEL: That's funny. 
HELENE: Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to? 
JIM: Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too.  
MICHAEL: You're 54 years old. 
HELENE: No. I'm 58. 
MICHAEL: You're 58 years old? 
HELENE: Uh huh. 
MICHAEL: Congratulations. 
MICHAEL: The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave. 
PAM: Mom, have you decided what you want to be called? 
HELENE: Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma. 
PAM: Please be Grandma. 
JIM: Definitely Grandma. 
PAM: I want you to be Grandma. 
HELENE: Oh, Michael what do you think? Grandma? 
MICHAEL:  That-- 
PAM: Yay, Grandma! 
MICHAEL: Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think? 
PAM: Maybe. 
MICHAEL: Helene? 
HELENE: Oh, oh no. I don't think so. 
MICHAEL: I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in? 
HELENE: Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out. It just-- doesn't interest me. 
MICHAEL: So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done. 
HELENE: Hmm... I might have done it when I was younger, but now there's just other things I'd rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming-- 
MICHAEL: Well there's no jumping in a triathlon. 
HELENE: Oh-- 
MICHAEL: You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping? 
HELENE: No, no...  
MICHAEL: Snowboarding? 
HELENE: You want to go snowboarding? 
MICHAEL: I might. 
HELENE: Michael, what are you talking about? 
MICHAEL:  Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to. 
ANDY:  Aye-yi-yi!  
DWIGHT: What's going on in here? 
OSCAR: Andy bought lunch. 
DWIGHT: Oh... no... really? 
ANDY: Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness. 
DWIGHT: There is no book. There's only a survival guide. 
ANDY: You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone. 
DWIGHT: Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga! 
MICHAEL: So we should get the check? 
PAM: What about your gift Michael? 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it. 
HELENE: I'm sure I won't. 
MICHAEL: Yes you will. 
PAM: He locked himself in his office all morning working on it. 
HELENE: Gimme. Look at this wrapping paper. It's got the word love on it in every language. 
PAM: Aww-- 
MICHAEL: I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper. 
HELENE:  A scrapbook of our first memories by Michael Gary Scott. For my girlfriend Helene on your birthday.  
MICHAEL: That's just an arbitrary title. 
HELENE: Ok, there's a penny. What's that from? 
JIM: Penny for your thoughts. 
HELENE: It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in. I went back later, waded in and I found it. 
JIM: Wow. 
PAM: That's amazing. 
MICHAEL: It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows. 
HELENE:  A poem! 
MICHAEL: Oh that I plagiarized I think. 
HELENE:  I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay... 
JIM:  Shel Silverstein. 
PAM: Yeah. 
HELENE: Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene. 
PAM: That's really nice Michael. 
MICHEL: I think it sucks. 
HELENE: I think it's wonderful, absolutely wonderful. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us. 
HELENE:  God... it's a scrapbook. 
PAM: Home run Michael. 
JIM: You set the bar so high. 
MICHAEL: That was a bunt. 
ANDY: Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this. 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered. 
ANDY: No, I insist. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.  
ANDY: Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous. 
DWIGHT: Don't worry about it. You can just owe me. 
PAM: Hey. Where'd you go? 
MICHAEL: Oh, just went to the bathroom. 
PAM: And then you stopped at the bar on the way back? 
MICHAEL: I got thirsty. 
PAM: Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake. 
MICHAEL: Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself. 
PAM: Cakes really good. 
HELENE: Oh, I know. I love how they use butter cream frosting. 
MICHAEL: Finish your cake, Helene. 
HELENE: Hmmm? 
MICHAEL: I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing. 
MICHAEL: Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her. 
PAM: Michael. Michael ,it's okay. 
MICHAEL: No it's not. 
PAM: I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy. 
MICHAEL: Wow. That just-- you've really grown. 
PAM: Well-- 
MICHAEL:  Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping. 
JIM: Okay, so-- 
MICHAEL: And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there. 
PAM: Michael. 
MICHAEL: It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer--  -- tility. 
HELENE: I, um-- I got it. 
HELENE: I'm 58. What am I supposed to do now? 
MICHAEL: Well, hobbies-- 
JIM: Stop. 
ANDY:  Ahh. 
DWIGHT: What's going on? 
ANDY: Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me. 
DWIGHT: Alright, move it. 
ANDY: What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost. 
DWIGHT: Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time. 
ANDY: It's like a little envelope-- there you go. 
DWIGHT: Got it.  To Dwight. Wha--  Starbucks gift card. 
ANDY: Surprise!  It's from everybody. $15 value. 
DWIGHT: Dammit. I am no closer to taking Jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now.  They're mushrooms. They don't get that high. 
MICHAEL: Pamela Beesly Halpert-- 
PAM: What? 
MICHAEL: May I have a word with you in my office please? 
PAM: I am working. 
MICHAEL: Well, this is a work related matter. 
PAM: Really? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
PAM: Really? 
MICHAEL: Yes. Join me please, won't you?  I am going to give you a raise. 
PAM: Why? 
MICHAEL: Because of all the good work you've done. 
PAM: I have the lowest sales record of anyone here. 
MICHAEL: That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude. 
PAM: I have the worst attitude of any person here. 
MICHAEL: Do you want the raise or what? 
PAM: Yeah, I'll take it.  
MICHAEL: Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude. 
PAM: You're bribing me? 
MICHAEL: No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or-- 
PAM: I want to hit you. 
MICHAEL: What? 
PAM: I want to hit you. I'll do that. 
MICHAEL:  Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding? 
PAM: No. Are you kidding? 
MICHAEL: Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just-- 
PAM: No. I don't think I can hit you in the office. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
PAM: So, um... we'll do it after work. In the parking lot. In front of everyone. I'm going to hit you as hard as I can. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
PAM: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
PAM: See you then. 
MICHAEL: See you. 
RYAN: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
RYAN: Quick question. 
KELLY: Yeah. 
RYAN: Are you scared? 
MICHAEL: Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking-- 
RYAN: We heard about the punch. 
MICHAEL: What punch? 
KELLY: Pam. She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work. 
MICHAEL: I'm pretty sure we said slap. 
KELLY: No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now. 
RYAN: I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen. Do you? 
MICHAEL: I-- mmm-- I'm good. 
RYAN: alright. See you there. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Do you and Pam ever get frisky? 
JIM: Inappropriate. 
MICHAEL: I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other? 
JIM: All the time. 
MICHAEL: Really? 
JIM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: She strong? 
JIM: She wants it bad Michael. 
MICHAEL: Can you stop this? 
JIM: I can. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
JIM: And I don't support her choice to hit you. 
MICHAEL: I don't either. 
JIM: But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning. 
MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm. I know. 
JIM: I just need some time. 
MICHAEL: You gotta do something-- 
JIM: I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision. 
MICHAEL: How much time do you think you'll need? 
JIM: No more than a week. Maybe two weeks. 
MICHAEL: Come on, man! 
TOBY: Pam, can I talk to you for a second? 
PAM: Oh... 
TOBY: I heard about the hit. Just-- make sure it's off company property, right? 
PAM: Right. 
TOBY: Okay, I think we should probably be okay. 
PAM: Okay. 
TOBY: Okay. And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot. So its-- its all one motion through the-- body. So you stay a little low and there's a twist. You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  Pow! 
PAM:  Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot. 
TOBY: Yes. 
PAM: Okay.  
TOBY: Yes. 
PAM: Wow! 
TOBY: Okay. 
MEREDITH: Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him. 
KEVIN: My money's on Pam. 
OSCAR: It's not a fight. What other outcome could there be? 
KEVIN: Michael could win. 
OSCAR: How? He can't hit back. 
KEVIN: Why can't you just agree with me sometimes? 
MICHAEL: Am I scared of getting hit in the face? No. Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege. I'm scared I'm gonna love it.  Let's do this. 
MICHAEL: It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home. 
KEVIN: We're here for the show, Michael. 
MICHAEL: You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn? 
KELLY: It has almost no calories. 
PAM: Are you ready? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
PAM:  You have to keep your hands down, Michael. 
MICHAEL: I know.  Okay. Alright.  Oh-- God! 
PAM: Michael, you have to put your hands down. 
ANGELA: Put your hands in your pockets. 
MICHAEL: Okay!  Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. 
PAM: What are you sorry for? 
MICHAEL: So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose. 
PAM: How about for dating my mom? 
MICHAEL: Maybe that-- 
PAM: And dumping her on her birthday. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
PAM: Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again. 
MICHAEL: Okay. I promise.  For the record your mom came on to me.  
PHYLLIS: Holy crap. 
PAM: Are you okay? 
MICHAEL: No! 
PAM: You're okay. 
JIM: Feel better? 
PAM: No. You were right. 
DWIGHT:  Wait, why are you limping? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. 
DWIGHT: Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs. 
MICHAEL: As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me. 
MICHAEL: Ahh...  
DWIGHT: Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down. 
MICHAEL: Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Fire Jim. 
MICHAEL: No. 
DWIGHT: I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him. 
MICHAEL: What are you talking about-- 
DWIGHT: Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers. 
MICHAEL: Forget that. 
DWIGHT: Can I have an office? 
MICHAEL: No. 
DWIGHT: You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it. 
MICHAEL:  Oh that feels better. 
DWIGHT:  Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you! 
JIM: Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change. 
DWIGHT: How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch  
JIM: OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know. 
DWIGHT: No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go! 
KEVIN: No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace. 
DWIGHT: False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me! 
JIM: OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you. 
DWIGHT: That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present. 
JIM: So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it? 
DWIGHT: Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes.  Block. Grasp wrist as such.  
JIM: And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two. 
DWIGHT: Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow.  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh! 
JIM: Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool. 
DWIGHT: He really is, but not for long.  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on. 
JIM: You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand. 
DWIGHT: The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise.  
MICHAEL: But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy. 
ANDY: I did stand up comedy once. 
MICHAEL: You did? 
ANDY: Yeah, I killed. 
MICHAEL: That sounds like it was hilarious. 
ANDY: It was hilarious. 
DWIGHT: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Yes? 
DWIGHT: What is the meaning of this email that everyone got? 
MICHAEL: You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day. 
DWIGHT: This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: Woo hoo, shout out! 
DWIGHT: Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP. 
MICHAEL: Erin, do we have the journal? 
ERIN: Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule. 
MICHAEL: Did you? 
PAM: Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online. 
MICHAEL: Oh, the Wall. 
OSCAR: I found the article.  "On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's. It is rumored that they will recommend... " and the article cuts off. 
MICHAEL: It's $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say?  
JIM: Are you serious?  
ANDY: I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it. 
PHYLLIS: "It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy." 
MICHAEL: No, no, that doesn't make any sense. 
STANLEY: Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs. 
OSCAR: Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things. Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that sounds awful. 
OSCAR: Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory. 
DWIGHT: You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize. David Wallace's 
SECRETARY: I'm sorry, Michael, David's in a meeting. 
MICHAEL: Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious!  David Wallace's 
SECRETARY: Um, I'll just have him call you back. 
MICHAEL: OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye.  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free. 
KEVIN:  Michael, are you OK? Did you throw up in there? 
MICHAEL: No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be. 
KEVIN: It smells like throw up in here. 
MICHAEL: Crazy world. Lotta smells. 
KELLY:  Guys, what if this is our last day at work? What if we never see each other ever again?  
ANDY: I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws. 
JIM:  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen. 
MICHAEL: OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins. 
JIM: Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine. So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along. 
MICHAEL: Monkey see, monkey do. 
JIM: That's it. 
MICHAEL: Monkey pee all over you. 
JIM: That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today? 
MICHAEL: We have a monthly staff meeting 
JIM: Alright, let's conference room it up!  Here's the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working. 
JIM: Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good. 
JIM: Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that. 
DWIGHT:  He needs me. Seat saved infinity.  
JIM: OK, great. 
MICHAEL:  What? Oh my God!  There has been a murder. There's been a murder in Savannah.  
MICHAEL: Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations. Battleship got me through my parents' divorce. Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation. I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across. 
MEREDITH:  Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game. 
MICHAEL: It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it... 
JIM: Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea. 
MICHAEL: This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder. 
JIM: I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this. 
MICHAEL: Tube City, you owe me one. 
JIM: Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one. Voice on CD 
PLAYER: August the 5th, 1955. It's a sad day down here in Savannah. Local magnate Bill Bourbon was killed last night and all y'all have congregated tonight for a meal to celebrate Bill as he passes on to his great reward. You're not just here to pay your respects, you have to figure out which of y'all is the no-count scoundrel who killed him. 
STANLEY: This is ridiculous.  
MICHAEL: There will be food. You leave, you do not get food. 
STANLEY: What kind of food? 
MICHAEL: Sandwich platters. 
STANLEY: I'm in.  
MICHAEL: Baby carrots.  
MICHAEL: OK, here are your character cards. Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props. Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is. Everything else is up to your imagination. So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse. 
KEVIN: Whoa, I'll try it. 
MICHAEL: OK, use your imaginations. 
ANDY: Who'd you get? 
ERIN: Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal. 
ANDY: Oooooo, saucy. 
ERIN: How about you? 
ANDY: Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother. 
ANGELA: Michael, I don't like this game. It's scary. 
MICHAEL: It's not scary. 
ANGELA: I don't like my character. 
PAM: Who are you? 
ANGELA: Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps. I'm not comfortable with this.  
MICHAEL: Well how do you think I feel? I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy. Every night, a different woman. Being oogled. Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful. 
MICHAEL:  Well, well, well. What is this contraption, I do declare? 
OSCAR: It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company. 
MICHAEL: Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare. 
RYAN: You don't have to keep saying "I do declare". Any time you say something it means you are declaring. 
MICHAEL: That is the way Southern people talk. 
JIM: And what Designing Woman are you basing that on? 
MICHAEL: Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery? 
PAM: I'll go.  My name is Deborah U. Tante. Deb for short. 
ANDY: That's clever, Debutante. 
PAM: Bill Bourbon was my uncle. I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug. 
MEREDITH: Nice accent. You sound like Forrest Gump. 
PAM: I do not. 
ANDY: Well, you do actually. You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth. 
KEVIN: Oooo, now do the Swedish chef. 
ANDY: Uh, not familiar, what province is he from? 
KEVIN: He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass. 
PHYLLIS: You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept. 
DWIGHT: Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class! 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing. 
DWIGHT: I will poison your food. 
ANDY: I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind. 
MICHAEL: Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now! 
MICHAEL: I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters. 
KEVIN: Y'all. 
CREED:  Sorry I'm late, boss. What's going on? 
MICHAEL:  Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect. 
CREED: OK. Hang on just a second. Let me just settle in and I'll be right back. 
MICHAEL: Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.  
ANDY:  Hey there young lady. 
ERIN: Hello. 
ANDY: I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend. 
ERIN: Sounds like a plan, Sugar. 
ANDY: Alright, a plan it is. 
DWIGHT: Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts. 
ANGELA: It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter. 
DWIGHT: I know you did it! 
DWIGHT: I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect. 
KEVIN:  Do you want to go out on a date with me? We can make out by the horses. 
ERIN: Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay. 
MEREDITH: How about a threesome? 
ERIN: Yeah, my boudoir's always open. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
ANDY: I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin. Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone. And she might be a murderer. 
OSCAR: I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors. 
PHYLLIS: What does that mean? 
OSCAR: Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity- 
MICHAEL:  Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah. 
OSCAR:  This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks. We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can't pay...  - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern. 
JIM: OK, I'm going back to work. 
MICHAEL: No no no no no no no.  I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue. Here we go. Voice on CD 
PLAYER: Well by now you've figured out that ol' Beatrix Bourbon was the killer. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, I was doing so well. 
MICHAEL:  Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the murderer is.  Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do? 
JIM: OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting. 
KEVIN: That could be a good sign. 
ANGELA: Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up. 
JIM: Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work. 
KEVIN: Now, Jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign. 
ANGELA: Don't just say things. 
JIM:  Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to- 
MICHAEL:  I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case. 
JIM: No, you're not reopening the case. The case is closed. 
MICHAEL: No it ain't. 
DWIGHT: Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns. 
ANDY: Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's. It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time. 
ERIN: I haven't seen it. 
ANDY: Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend? 
ERIN:  Of course, Nathaniel. 
ANDY: Yeah, OK. 
ERIN:  Where are you taking me? 
ANDY:  Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah. 
ERIN:  Savannah? That's a far way from Scranton. 
ANDY: Did you mean a real date? 
ERIN: No.  Did you? 
ANDY: Totally... not.  
ERIN: I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game. 
DWIGHT: You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid? 
MICHAEL: I already declared you, it was too dark to tell. 
DWIGHT: Stop playing games with me, Crawdad. 
MICHAEL: This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir. 
DWIGHT: Answer me. 
MICHAEL: You are out of order. 
DWIGHT: You are out of order. 
MICHAEL: You are- 
PAM: I think Michael may have snapped. 
JIM: Or maybe he's just stuck in character. 
PAM: Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck? 
JIM: Both. They're both worse. 
JIM: It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out. We're not going under. 
PAM: Jim, what if we both lose our jobs? I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one. 
MICHAEL:  Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors? 
JIM: Michael, not now. 
MICHAEL: Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now. Come on. Come on. 
PAM: I should just go.  Where to now Caleb? 
MICHAEL: To Mama Juju Boo Boo. 
JIM: Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why. 
MICHAEL: Because this is the recreation of a crime scene. 
MEREDITH:  I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks. 
DWIGHT: Hey shut up. You're dead. 
JIM: Michael, can I talk to you in your office? 
MICHAEL: No Michael here, my name is- 
JIM: Caleb! 
JIM: Today of all days... 
MICHAEL: No, you shut up. They need this game, Jim. Let us have this stupid little game, alright?  
MICHAEL:  Oh, you startled me. My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest. What can I do you for? 
ERIN: Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call. 
MICHAEL: Detective Wallace? 
ERIN: I don't think so. I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here. 
OSCAR: You're not gonna answer the phone? 
MICHAEL: No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room. 
JIM: I'll take it. 
JIM: Hey David. 
DAVID: Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late. Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet. 
JIM: Oh, OK. 
DAVID: But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good. We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year. Insolvent. So, well... You know what? I'm sorry, I have to run. But we will talk soon, OK? 
JIM: Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to- 
DAVID: You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great. Keep after it, but I gotta run. 
JIM: OK. 
DAVID: Thanks Jim. 
JIM: See ya. 
PAM:  What's the news? 
JIM: Nothing yet. 
PHYLLIS: Well, I guess that's not- 
JIM: Well there is some bad news.  There has been another murder. 
MICHAEL: A murder, you say? I do declare. 
JIM: Conference room everyone. 
STANLEY: Do we have to play? 
JIM: No. 
STANLEY: Super. 
DWIGHT: Oh, this could be a juicy one. 
MICHAEL: Get in there! 
JIM: I think today was a good day to have two managers. 'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy. It's because they're doing it for the kids. And I get that now. 
MICHAEL: There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue. My little heart can barely take it no more.  Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time. 
ANDY:  I didn't do it! 
DWIGHT: OK, everybody just calm down. 
ANDY: I am calm. 
MICHAEL: On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns. 
DWIGHT: I have crossbows. 
MICHAEL: We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready? 
DWIGHT: OK, I'm ready. 
MICHAEL: One, two, three..  
JIM: Andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent. Oh, and it is 6:00. 
JIM:  Really? 
PAM:  It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this! 
JIM: Yeah, I want to go home. 
PAM: Get the keys out of my purse, start the car.  
OSCAR:  Not again. 
DWIGHT: Bow down before Recyclops. 
JIM: Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops. 
DWIGHT: Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter? 
JIM: The next year he really stepped things up. 
DWIGHT: Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin? 
JIM: A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape. 
DWIGHT: Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns. 
JIM: Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember. 
DWIGHT: Recyclops will have his revenge. 
JIM: I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved. 
PAM: Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops. 
DWIGHT: Recyclops destroys!  
STANLEY: Oh, is today Recyclops Day? 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
STANLEY: I thought you were killed by Polluticorn. 
DWIGHT: Polluticorn wishes.  
ANDY: That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment. 
DWIGHT: Humans are terrible for the environment. 
PAM: The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child. 
JIM: Mmm. 
PAM: A world where you truly can be anything you want. 
JIM: God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart.  
MICHAEL:  Ok. Ok. How 'bout this?  
PAM: That's great. 
MICHAEL: I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.  
PAM: Sure. 
MICHAEL: Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face. 
MEREDITH: And it looks like you're taking a dump. 
MICHAEL: Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild. 
ANDY:  Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott.  
PAM: Don't do the twirl. 
PHYLLIS: Lose the twirl. 
DWIGHT: The twirl sucks. 
KEVIN: Michael, I hated the twirl. 
ANDY:  Hate the twirl! 
MICHAEL: Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, good. Don't do it. 
MICHAEL: I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin. 
OSCAR: The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it. 
MICHAEL: Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points. 
OSCAR: Those are the bullet points. 
MICHAEL: Well, could you condense it please? 
OSCAR: That's as simple as I can make it. 
ERIN: Michael? The limo's here for you. 
MICHAEL: It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling. 
ERIN: He said limousine, so... 
KEVIN:  Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here.  Michael, look. Oh, man. 
MICHAEL: They sent a limo. 
MICHAEL: Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that. 
DWIGHT: What kind of mileage does this baby get? 
ERIN: It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows. 
OSCAR: This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs. 
MICHAEL: Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs. 
DWIGHT: Calves. Calves all the way. 
ANDY: I'm so jealous right now. 
MICHAEL: Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you- Limo 
DRIVER: Car seats eight. 
MICHAEL: What? Limo 
DRIVER: The car seats eight. 
MICHAEL: The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest. Jim & 
PAM: No thanks. 
RYAN: I'll use it when you're done. 
MICHAEL:  Mmm... whoa. 
OSCAR: The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers. 
MICHAEL:  I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here. 
ANDY: Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here? 
MICHAEL: Definitely. 
DWIGHT: Smells like it. 
MICHAEL: Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed. 
DWIGHT: Word. 
ANDY: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
MICHAEL:  Who's playing with the button? 
JIM: Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook? 
RYAN: Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under. 
JIM: But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program. 
RYAN: The company's probably going under, though. 
JIM: Could go either way. 
RYAN: Seems like it's leaning one way. 
JIM: Maybe we should just wait and find out. 
RYAN: Definitely. 
JIM: Ok. 
RYAN: So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff? 
JIM: Nah. Might as well do it now. 
ANDY: Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what? 
MICHAEL: I will have to answer. 
DWIGHT: I'll ask you a question. 
ANDY: Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park. 
DWIGHT: Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it? 
MICHAEL: No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.'  I won't say that. I'll something like that. 
ANDY: This is your big day. Come on. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my god. This is it. 
LAURIE: Mr. Scott? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
LAURIE: I'm Laurie. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hi. 
LAURIE: Thank you for joining us. Come with me. 
MICHAEL: Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott. 
LAURIE: Ok. If you just want to follow me I'll take you up to the lounge. 
MICHAEL: Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So - 
ANDY: Kay. 
DWIGHT: Good luck, Michael. 
MICHAEL: See you later. 
MICHAEL:  Officers. Thank you. 
LAURIE: After you, Mr. Scott. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
DAVID: Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hello. 
DAVID: So glad you could make it. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
DAVID: How was the ride? 
MICHAEL: Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime. 
DAVID: I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton. 
ALAN: It's nice to meet you, Michael. 
MICHAEL: It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege. 
DAVID: Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe. 
MICHAEL: Ah.  Your eminence. 
REGISTRAR: For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles. 
DWIGHT: Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che.  Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.  Ah. Damn it.  Wha- okay  
DWIGHT: I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy. 
OSCAR: Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall.  Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple. 
ANDY: Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line. 
OSCAR: Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you. 
ANDY: Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis? 
DWIGHT: How is he gonna have grandkids? 
MICHAEL: You guys ever protect the president? 
SECURITY: No. 
MICHAEL: What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous? 
SECURITY: Not supposed to talk about it. Nelly Furtado. 
ALAN: Alright, guys. You ready? 
MICHAEL: Rock and roll.  
ALAN: Dunder Mifflin is still a strong company. We are poised to come through this more streamlined and profitable than ever.  
MICHAEL:  This is not as much fun as I thought it would be. 
DAVID: It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy. 
MICHAEL:  We're going bankrupt, you think?  They are really angry. 
ALAN: The shareholders need to empower our leadership - Woman in 
LINE: I'm just gonna run to the bathroom. Will you save my place? Man in 
LINE: Sure. 
DWIGHT: No. You will not. Woman in 
LINE: Excuse me? 
DWIGHT: Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences? Woman in 
LINE: It'll just be a second. 
DWIGHT: Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest. 
ALAN: ... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager. 
DWIGHT:  Yes. 
ALAN: In these uncertain times, Michael has managed to maintain steady profits from his Scranton branch. We all thank you, Michael.  Another bright spot in the Dunder Mifflin landscape, our new waste pulp re-purposing plant in Milford.  
JIM: Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now? 
PHYLLIS: Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy. 
JIM: Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things. 
JIM: I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael.  What's so funny? I'm a co-manager. 
STANLEY: That doesn't make you a boss. 
PHYLLIS: It's not like you can fire people or anything. 
JIM: Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this? 
PHYLLIS: Ryan. 
STANLEY: Can't say. 
PHYLLIS: Sorry. Plastered. 
JIM: Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?  
PAM: Stuff gets around. I don't participate. 
JIM: Who here heard it from Ryan? 
KEVIN: Does and email count? 
JIM: Yes. 
KEVIN: Yeah.  
JIM: I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?  
PAM: I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one. 
OSCAR: These questions are bush league. 
ANDY: You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there.  Don't be a wuss. 
ANDY: I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose . 
DAVID:  Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship. 
SHAREHOLDER: You're a criminal. 
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's - Female 
SHAREHOLDER: Limousine? 
MICHAEL: Yes. Second 
SHAREHOLDER: You're all corrupt. You should be in jail.  
ALAN: Quiet! Quiet, please! Please, quiet! Quiet, please. We want to hear your questions. 
RYAN: Do you love her or do you love the idea of her? 
CREED: I don't know, man. I just don't know. 
JIM: I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him? 
PAM: Can you actually fire people? 
JIM: To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people. 
PAM: Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone. 
JIM: Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell. 
PAM: Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'. 
JIM: Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day. 
PAM: Well, you'll figure it out. 
ALAN: Ok. We're gonna take a 15 minute break and then we're gonna answer more questions. Third 
SHAREHOLDER: You haven't said anything yet and we're headed for bankruptcy.  
MICHAEL:  Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers.  I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them - Fourth 
SHAREHOLDER: How are you gonna fix the company? 
MICHAEL: Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track.  45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business.  And you can take that to the bank.  And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.  I love you, New York!  You. You. 
JIM: Hey, Ryan. How's it going? 
RYAN:  Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist... 
JIM: Mmm-hmm. 
RYAN: That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version. 
JIM: Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it. 
RYAN: Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it? 
JIM: You know what? 
RYAN: What? 
JIM: I think I know the problem. 
RYAN: Great. 
JIM: I think you seem distracted. 
RYAN: Yep, that is a problem. 
JIM: But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help. 
RYAN: Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim. 
JIM: I am, too. Let me show you. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Things are really picking up. 
O'KEEFE: What was that about? 
MICHAEL: What? 
ALAN: You were supposed to wave. 
MICHAEL: I did wave. I did a lot more than wave. 
DAVID: What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole. 
MICHAEL: We tell them the plan, right? 
DAVID: There is no plan. 
MICHAEL: Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes. 
O'KEEFE: Excuse me? 
MICHAEL: Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out. 
O'KEEFE: Who the hell is this guy? 
MICHAEL: I am the guy who roused that crowd. 
DAVID: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Got them on their feet. 
DAVID: Yes. 
MICHAEL: They were so happy down there. 
DAVID: Yes. 
ALAN: Who cares? 
MICHAEL: Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor. 
DAVID: No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm texting him, so. 
DAVID: Please do not text anybody, now, Michael. 
MICHAEL: It's done.  
MICHAEL: Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away.  
JIM: I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second.  Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention.  I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people. 
RYAN: Mmm-hmm. 
JIM: Let me show you what I mean.  Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done. 
RYAN: I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight. 
JIM: Right. 
RYAN: Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything. 
JIM:  You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it.  
RYAN:  Is there internet? 
OSCAR: Ummm... 
MICHAEL: Tell them what you told me. This is genius. 
OSCAR: Ok 
MICHAEL: Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all - 
OSCAR: Um.. 
MICHAEL: It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them. 
OSCAR: I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands. 
MICHAEL: That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better. 
OSCAR: I think this has gone very well and I thank you. 
MICHAEL: O-kay. Oh... hey, hey.  What are you doing? 
OSCAR: Michael, I didn't ask to come up here. 
MICHAEL: Wow, man. That - 
OSCAR: What? 
MICHAEL: That was embarrassing. 
OSCAR: For me. 
MICHAEL: For me, too. You embarrassed me. 
OSCAR: You - 
MICHAEL: Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow. 
O'KEEFE: He's our best manager? Where's the off button on this moron? 
MICHAEL: Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron. 
MICHAEL:  
MICHAEL: Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate. 
O'KEEFE: He can take the bus. He's had his limo ride. 
MICHAEL:  Oscar! Oscar! Come on! There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin! 
ALAN: The gentleman in the, uh, glasses. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble.  Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there.  A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to. 
ALAN: Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
ANDY: You wanted to see me? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, Have a seat. 
ANDY: Is it serious?  Wow. Andy's a wittle scared. 
MICHAEL: Okay, right there is the problem. There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk. 
ANDY: Why would people say that? 
MICHAEL: I have it on good authority that you said the following.  Can you read that back to me? 
ANDY: Andy have a boo-boo tummy. 
MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm. 
ANDY: Would you rather me say "Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?" 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
ANDY: "Crazy diarrhea happening right now?" Cause things can get real adult real fast. 
MICHAEL: You are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand." 
ANDY: Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes. Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across? Well if I do, Andy's sowwy. 
MICHAEL: You can't be a baby in the office. It makes me look like I hire babies. 
ANDY: Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying. 
MICHAEL: Okay, who said that? 
ANDY: I don't-just people. For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic. 
MICHAEL:  Well, thank you... thank you a lot. And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops. 
ANDY:  Tank you Mr. Elwis. 
MICHAEL:  You're welcome, baby. 
ANDY: Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news. 
JIM: Wait, are you the patient or the doctor? 
ANDY: The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays. 
JIM: Wow, what do you put our chances at? 
ANDY: 0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat! 
JIM: Hmm, sounds risky. 
ANDY: Don't worry. There is a surefire cure. Employee of the Month. Every awesome place I've worked has had one. 
ANDY: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron. 
JIM: Wow, that's not such a bad idea. 
ANDY: Great!  
JIM: Anything else? 
ANDY: Nope!  
ERIN: Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day? There's a bunch of those. 
MICHAEL: Keep. 
ERIN: There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say "Delivered." Should I delete all of those? 
MICHAEL: I want to keep those so I can see what I sent. 
ERIN: That's why you have a "Sent Mail" folder. 
MICHAEL: Keep. 
ERIN: There's about 30 news alerts for "Nip Slip." 
MICHAEL: For what? 
ERIN: "Nip slip." 
MICHAEL: Oh okay. I don't know how those got on there... 
ERIN: Well... 
MICHAEL: Must be hackers. 
JIM: Hey. What's up? 
MICHAEL: What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend? 
JIM: Did you murder someone? 
MICHAEL: Worse than that. 
ERIN: Oh, my God. 
MICHAEL: Lurk much?  I miss Pam. 
JIM: I think she's okay. 
MICHAEL: Is that what we're going for now? "okay?" We used to go for "pretty good." 
JIM: Great. Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies, but... 
JIM: You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager. 
MICHAEL: Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month. 
JIM: It would look bad. Sorry. 
MICHAEL: It would look good, on my mantle. 
ANDY: Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! Your idea. 
DWIGHT: My idea. I just need Andy to think it's his idea. So it won't get traced back to me. In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace. He will be fired. 
ERIN: Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory? 
PAM:  Looks great. 
ERIN: Oh, did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't. 
PAM: Okay.  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence? 
MICHAEL: There you are. I don't think we have finished with my Inbox. 
PHYLLIS: What's "Scott's Tots?" 
STANLEY: Has it really been ten years? 
STANLEY:  "Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders" 
PAM: Michael, why did you promise that? 
MICHAEL: To change lives. 
PAM: No Michael, why would you promise that? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, okay. Call the school, cancel. I can't go through with this. 
ERIN: We've already rescheduled seven times. 
PAM: Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done. 
MICHAEL: Well... 
PAM: It's terrible. 
MICHAEL: No. 
PAM: Just terrible. And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get. 
MICHAEL: I just, I fell in love with those kids. and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise. I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education. I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous. 
MICHAEL: Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right? 
PAM: No! 
MICHAEL: I'm not a bad person, I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college. Okay, all right. 
PAM: You have to tell them. 
MICHAEL: Would you come with me? You know, like old times, instead of...  
ERIN: I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it. 
PAM: It's fine. Erin, you're going to go. And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth. 
MICHAEL: Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse? 
DWIGHT: Hey Jimmy, what's up? 
JIM: Not much. 
DWIGHT: Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office. 
JIM:  Thanks Dwight. 
DWIGHT: That laugh is so infectious. 
JIM: You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go. 
DWIGHT: I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work. 
JIM: Let me guess, you think you should get it. 
DWIGHT: This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize. 
JIM: Well, in an ideal world... 
DWIGHT: In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching. 
JIM: Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense." 
DWIGHT: I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data. 
JIM: That's okay, I'll do it. 
MIKELA: Mr. Scott? 
MICHAEL: Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you? 
MIKELA: I'm good. 
MICHAEL: Good to see you. Where's your saxaphone? 
MIKELA: It's in the music room, Mr. Scott. 
MICHAEL: Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind. 
ERIN: Wow! 
MICHAEL: Well, you didn't even hear it. 
MIKELA: Everyone's so excited that you're here today. 
MICHAEL: Oh, good. 
MIKELA: Now, I know you probably want to see everyone, but I was wondering if I could ask you some questions first? 
MICHAEL: Sure. 
ERIN:  You're famous. 
MIKELA: I'm sure you remember this place. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah. 
MIKELA: Do you want to go in? 
MICHAEL: No, not at all. Nope, come on. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you know what? You know what? I shouldn't go in there. I'm pretty busy, I should just... 
MIKELA: We just want to say thanks. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
STUDENTS:  Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott! 
TEACHER: Mr. Scott, I know you're a busy man, and your schedule moves around a lot. But through all your generosity through the years, your tots, who are ready to graduate, thought it was time to give you a proper thank you. 
STUDENTS:  Oh! What? Oh! Break it down! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! 
LEFEVRE: You came into our lives and made a promise, made us honest, made us realize, we don't need to compromise, cause we can have it all! Cause you made it possible, for us to achieve the improbable! 
STUDENTS: Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! 
MICHAEL: Wow! 
DWIGHT: Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in- 
KEVIN: Hey. 
DWIGHT: So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing. 
KEVIN: Jim said that? 
DWIGHT: He thought you were doing an incredible job last month. 
KEVIN: Jim said that? 
DWIGHT: You seem suprised. 
KEVIN: No, no, that makes total sense. 
DWIGHT: Hey buddy, so every- 
OSCAR: Sure.  
DWIGHT: Five minutes ahead of schedule. Right on schedule. 
TEACHER: Politicians are always coming around, telling us they're going to fix our schools, promising this and that. But you, Mr. Scott, you are actually doing it. You have taught these kids with hard work, that anything is possible. You are a dream maker and I thank you! I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, I thank you! So much. 
LEFEVRE: There were a lot of times over the years where I was pressured to get into the drug game. But I always thought back to my guardian angel, and the gift that you gave me. So I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to go to college, educate myself, and become the next President Obama. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, God. Oh, God. 
JIM: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome. I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes. And the winner is, employee number nine. And that is? 
ANDY: Number nine, number nine. Jim Halpert. 
EVERYONE: Huh? What? 
OSCAR: Are you kidding me? 
DWIGHT: Oh, no! 
JIM: Okay, wait, I was not... I did not- 
KEVIN: I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not? 
JIM: Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score. 
ANGELA: To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us. 
JIM: Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize. 
ANGELA: Yes! 
JIM: Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, you said "In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize." Isn't that what you said? 
JIM: No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money. But- 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money. 
TEACHER: Let's put your hands together and give a warm welcome for the man of the hour, Mr. Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: All right. Wow. Um, I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives? Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "A" gym and "B" gym, that sort of thing? Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay. Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share. Ummm.  Should we go? 
TEACHER: Oh, no. We're okay. It's a double period 
MICHAEL: Ah. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, you're going to make me say it. All right, I am so proud of all of you. Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name? 
ZION: I'm Zion, I'm Mikela's younger brother. 
MICHAEL: Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition. Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition. I'm so, so sorry. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
MIKELA: You lied to us. 
MICHAEL: I lied to myself too. I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s, I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place. 
LEFEVRE: You owe this to us! 
MICHAEL: Okay, hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class. Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience. And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.  Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you. 
STUDENTS:  
MICHAEL: Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. They're lithium. 
JIM: Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it. Okay? This was your idea anyway. 
ANDY: Correction. It was my idea. 
JIM: Okay. 
DWIGHT: My idea! 
CREED: Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant. 
PAM: Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on. 
PHYLLIS: That's fair. 
DWIGHT: Excellent idea, Pam. 
PAM: Thank you. 
ANDY: That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert. 
PHYLLIS: How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible? 
DWIGHT: There must be some reasonable explanation for this. 
PAM: No, wait, come on. I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month. 
ANDY: Oh, really? From what, two to four? 
PAM: Yup. 
JIM: Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay? 
DELIVERYMAN: Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert. 
JIM: Okay. That is me, but I didn't order the cake. 
KEVIN: Look who it is!  
ANGELA: "It could only be you!" Way to go. 
DWIGHT: He knew all along! 
KELLY: I'm going to have some cake. 
STEPHANIE: David Wallace's office. 
DWIGHT:  This is Kevin Malone, is David there? 
STEPHANIE: No, he's in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message? 
DWIGHT: Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam. 
DWIGHT:  This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace. 
DWIGHT:  It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things are getting really bad down here. 
LEFEVRE: Hey, Mr. Scott. 
MICHAEL: Erin, can you give us a second? 
LEFEVRE: That was messed up what you did. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry. 
LEFEVRE: Who does something like that? Who promises that to a bunch of kids and then just doesn't come through like that? 
MICHAEL: What can I do? 
LEFEVRE: You can pay for my college. 
MICHAEL: I can give you an extra laptop battery. Not everyone took one. How about this? If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay? 
LEFEVRE: They're expensive. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right? 
LEFEVRE: It's about $1,000. 
MICHAEL: Really? Wow. That's over $200 a year. 
LEFEVRE: No, $1,000 each year. 
MICHAEL: For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now, you are to use one check a year. And please call me before you cash the check? Cause I've got monies to move around. 
LEFEVRE: Okay. Okay. Make it out to my mom, Rosa. 
MICHAEL: That's a lot of zeroes. 
JIM: This is Jim. David 
WALLACE: Jim, what the hell is happening there? 
JIM: Hey, uh David. 
DAVID: Yes. 
JIM: So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it. 
DAVID: Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife? 
JIM: No. 
DAVID: Am I missing something? 
JIM: I really don't know how it happened, David. 
DWIGHT: I know how it happened.  
DAVID: Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier. If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion. 
JIM: All right, it will not happen again. I promise. 
DAVID: Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you. 
DWIGHT: No! 
DAVID: It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job, right? 
DWIGHT: What? 
JIM: Yeah. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: No. 
DAVID: Okay. Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend? 
DWIGHT: What? 
JIM: Yes. 
DAVID: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Oh, you're kidding me! 
JIM: See you. 
DWIGHT: Damn it! 
ERIN: Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do--- 
MICHAEL: Please stop. 15 lives. I destroyed 15 young lives today. 
ERIN: No. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
ERIN: No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy. 
MICHAEL: You're what, like, 12? 
ERIN: The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out. Which is something to think about, I think. 
MICHAEL: I think you're doing a great job. 
ERIN: Really? 
MICHAEL: What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business? 
ERIN: I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant. 
MICHAEL: Really? 
ERIN: Yes, but I'm terrible at math so... 
MICHAEL: You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse. 
ERIN: Seriously? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. I just sort've had a feeling about him. I have a feeling about you too. Michael and 
ERIN: Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. 
JIM: See you tomorrow, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Apparently. 
RYAN: How's it going? Good day? 
DWIGHT: Not now, Temp. 
RYAN: Um, okay, so, um, listen. I know about your diabolical plan. 
DWIGHT: What? Diabolical plan? I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol...  
RYAN: I found a copy of it in the copier tray. 
DWIGHT: So what do you want? 
RYAN: I want the same thing you want. I want to take Jim Halpert down. I want in. 
DWIGHT:  Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of-- 
JIM: Too loud. 
DWIGHT: --the party planning committee... 
JIM: Too, too loud. Too Loud. 
DWIGHT: But effective, look!  On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas. 
EVERYONE: Merry Christmas. 
DWIGHT: Merry Christmas. Good. 
DWIGHT: My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph!  Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed. 
DWIGHT: It is time to unveil the tree. 
OSCAR: Hey, Rockefeller Center! 
JIM: Yeah. 
RYAN: Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that. 
JIM: This is all we have. 
RYAN: Ugh. 
JIM: No, it's not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie. 
DWIGHT: It is warm feelings. 
MEREDITH: Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it? 
DWIGHT: Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight!  
JIM: Why would you start so high? 
DWIGHT: Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ... 
JIM: Three, two, one!  
PHYLLIS: Ooh. 
PAM: Ah! 
PHYLLIS: You didn't decorate it? 
JIM: No. 
DWIGHT: Exactly. 
JIM: We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together. 
DWIGHT: Everyone. 
ANDY: Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up? 
PAM: Is it, is it fake? 
JIM: Pam! 
DWIGHT: Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die... 
JIM: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Like the spirit of Christmas! 
STANLEY: We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree? 
DWIGHT: This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas! 
ERIN: Hello. Sorry guys.  Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop. 
KELLY: What psycho would send that as a gift?  
ANDY: I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds?  
PHYLLIS: Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus! 
DWIGHT: Hey Santa! 
OSCAR: They finally let you do it! 
PHYLLIS: Yeah! 
KEVIN: Congrats Phil! 
ERIN: It's so edgy! 
PHYLLIS: I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it.  It's been a long journey... but  I'm Santa Claus! 
PAM: So Santa, what can we expect from this party? 
PHYLLIS: It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good! 
CREED: What if you've been bad? 
PHYLLIS: Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you! 
CREED: What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong? 
JIM: Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal! 
PHYLLIS: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail! 
PAM: You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box! 
OSCAR: That's funny. 
PAM: Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny.  I think my water just broke! 
OSCAR: That's too funny. 
PAM: Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy! 
MICHAEL: Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see.  
PAM: Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: What the hell is going on? 
MICHAEL: Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa? 
JIM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Phyllis? 
JIM: Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it. 
MICHAEL: Take it back. That is absurd. 
JIM: No, I'm not gonna do that. 
MICHAEL: No? No! Jim! Come on! 
JIM: I think she's doing a good job. 
MICHAEL: It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on! 
JIM: I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa. 
MICHAEL: Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those. 
MICHAEL: If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore. 
MICHAEL:  Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt! 
GROUP:  Okay... 
MICHAEL: No it's not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, what's your name? 
KEVIN: Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap. 
MICHAEL: Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well. 
KEVIN: When can I sit on your lap? 
MICHAEL: Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God. 
KEVIN: That's really comfortable.  
MICHAEL: What would you like for Christmas little boy? 
KEVIN: I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that. 
MICHAEL: What did you think was going to happen? 
KEVIN: I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before. 
MICHAEL: All right, just say "some toys" please. 
KEVIN: Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list. 
MICHAEL: Damn it Kevin, come on. 
KEVIN: What about if I tell you the things I don't want? 
MICHAEL: Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God! 
KEVIN: I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted! 
MICHAEL: Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again. 
KEVIN: Awesome. 
PHYLLIS: Well? 
JIM: I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa. 
PHYLLIS: The only Santa. 
JIM: That's what I want. 
PHYLLIS: You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved! 
JIM: What would Bob do? 
PHYLLIS: Never mind, I shouldn't have said that. 
ANDY: Does it hurt? 
ERIN: It stings a lot. 
ANDY: Hmm. 
ERIN: I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts. 
ANDY: I know, right? 
ERIN: So far no one will admit to it. 
ANDY: Huh! 
ERIN: Is it you?  
ANDY: Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It's me. 
ERIN: Seriously? 
ANDY: "Seriously?" Are you serious? 
ERIN: What? 
ANDY: Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted! 
OSCAR: There he is. 
DARYL: Hey. 
OSCAR: Is Matt around? I got his check. 
DARYL: Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it. 
OSCAR: Ah, I'll just... wait for him. 
DARYL: Matt's a pretty good-looking dude, don't you think? 
OSCAR: I'll just leave it here with you.  
MICHAEL: Ryan come here! 
RYAN: Whoa, whoa. 
MICHAEL: Come on, come on. 
RYAN: I'm doing something over here. 
MICHAEL: Ahhh... Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here! 
RYAN: What are you talking about? 
MICHAEL: Just sit down! 
RYAN: No no no. 
JIM: Hey hey hey. Everything okay? 
MICHAEL: Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun! 
JIM: Can I just talk to you for a second? 
MICHAEL: Whoop! Okay, what? 
JIM: You can't yell out "I need this, I need this" as you pin down an employee on your lap! 
MICHAEL: Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless! 
JIM: Yup. 
MICHAEL: Do you understand, you forced my hand? 
JIM: Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa. 
MICHAEL: Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why don't "we" take a vote on it? 
JIM: Great! 
MICHAEL: Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are-- 
JIM: Who wants Phyllis as Santa?  
MICHAEL: No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me? 
KEVIN: Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis. 
JIM: And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand.  Can I get you some punch? 
MICHAEL: I'll get some punch. That looks delicious.  
OFFICE: Aw, Michael! 
DWIGHT: Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger. 
PHYLLIS: How do you know it's a gun? 
DWIGHT: What else does it look like? 
STANLEY: Not a gun. 
DWIGHT: Well I don't have all the pieces yet. 
STANLEY: Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun. 
DWIGHT: Not a gun.  
PHYLLIS: In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin!  
MICHAEL: I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. "Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself." That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me? Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me. 
MICHAEL: Behold!  Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas.  Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget. 
TOBY: Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is. 
MICHAEL: Oh the Anti-Christ! 
TOBY: You can't,  Ow. Look, you cannot push religion. 
MICHAEL: Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying? 
TOBY: No! 
MICHAEL: Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company! 
ANDY: Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa? 
PHYLLIS: All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael. 
ANDY: Okay. Kelly and 
ERIN:  I saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas day, on Christmas day... 
PAM: Have you talked to him? 
OSCAR: Who? 
PAM: Matt? 
OSCAR: Is it that obvious?  No- hey... 
PAM: Mmm! Good pate, right?  Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar? 
MATT: I don't think so. 
PAM: Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate. 
MATT: I had some. 
PAM: Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right? 
OSCAR: Okay Pam. 
PAM: Okay. 
PAM: Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together. 
PHYLLIS: This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch! 
DWIGHT: We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot.  
MICHAEL:  Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit? 
DWIGHT: Yes!  
MICHAEL: Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts... 
PHYLLIS: Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year - 
STANLEY: I have. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get? 
KEVIN: He got scented candles! 
MICHAEL:  Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley. 
ANGELA: Amen. 
PHYLLIS: And this brings us to you, little one. 
MICHAEL:  I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up. 
ANGELA: It's fabric! I really wanted this. 
MICHAEL:  That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet. 
ANGELA: Andy, is this you? 
MICHAEL:  No! 
PHYLLIS: It's a secret. 
MICHAEL:  Andy had Erin. 
ANDY: Nnnnya. 
MICHAEL:  What? Was I not supposed to say it?  What? Turn it back on. 
JIM: No.  
DAVID: Yes Michael, what is so urgent? 
MICHAEL: David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as. 
DAVID: I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up. 
MICHAEL: I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards. 
DAVID: Michael... 
MICHAEL: I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa. 
DAVID: Michael- 
MICHAEL: What? 
DAVID: This is a very very bad time. 
MICHAEL: Really? What's going on? 
DAVID: Stephanie, can you hop off please? 
STEPHANIE: Sure David.  
MICHAEL: What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time? 
ERIN: Do you want me off the call too Michael? 
MICHAEL: Hey! Get off! Get off the phone! 
DAVID: Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house. 
MICHAEL: What does that mean? 
DAVID: I'll be fired. 
MICHAEL: Well, can't Alan protect you? 
DAVID: Alan will be out too. All of us. 
MICHAEL: All of us? 
DAVID: Goodbye Michael. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God. 
MICHAEL: Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into. 
MICHAEL: Hey. How's everybody doing? 
JIM: Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half. 
MICHAEL: That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus. 
ANGELA: Are you serious? This is so offensive. 
MICHAEL: You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room. 
DWIGHT: What's your pin number? 
MICHAEL: I don't want to say. But, "it's fun to stay at the -"  
MICHAEL: "It's fun to stay at the -" 
DWIGHT: Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ... 
MICHAEL:  Mmm, mm mm mm.  
ANDY: I, I thought that you would like it. 
ERIN: It was a little much Andy. 
ANDY: Well it's the thought that counts. 
ERIN: What were you thinking?  
ANDY: I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen. 
MICHAEL: You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "How could they do this to us?" 
JIM: What? 
PAM: How could we do what?  
MICHAEL: It's not... Nevermind. Nothing.  
STANLEY: We deserve to know. 
MICHAEL: I didn't say anything! 
ANGELA: If you know something Michael... 
MICHAEL: We're going out of business! 
GROUP: WHAT? 
JIM: What? 
DWIGHT: You are kidding me! 
JIM: Wait wait wait, who said that? 
MICHAEL: David told me on the phone. David told me. 
DWIGHT: When? When did he tell you? Today? 
MICHAEL: Earlier today. 
DWIGHT: Awww! 
MICHAEL: He said, we have been sold.  
JIM: What? 
DWIGHT: Aaaarrhh!  
MICHAEL: Dwight! Jesus! 
ANGELA: Come on! 
JIM: Michael, wait. So they said we are sold? 
MICHAEL: David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone. 
JIM: Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things. 
MICHAEL: It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith. 
MEREDITH: No, I get it. 
MICHAEL: I'll call him. I'll call David. 
JIM: No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him. 
MICHAEL: He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom. 
DAVID: Hey Sweetie, what is it? 
MICHAEL: It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott. 
DAVID: What the hell? 
MICHAEL: Stephanie could you hop off please? 
DAVID: Michael, I have never- 
MICHAEL: David! 
DAVID: Ever, ever... 
MICHAEL: David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse. 
DWIGHT: Hey David. 
KELLY: Hi David!  
DAVID: Hello everyone. 
MICHAEL: David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned. 
DAVID: You weren't supposed to tell anyone Michael. 
MICHAEL: Well I think we're past that now. 
DAVID: I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know. 
JIM: Oh my God, David. That's horrible. 
MEREDITH: How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman. 
DAVID: Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works. So congratulations. 
MICHAEL: We're not fired? 
DAVID: No! No, and congratulations. 
MICHAEL: Yeah!  It's a Christmas miracle! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Woo hoo!  
DWIGHT:  I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone.  
DWIGHT: It's true. We all walk alone. 
KELLY:  Jim.... Jim!  
DWIGHT:  My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating... 
TOBY:  Wow! Cause...  
RYAN: Yeah! That was the idea. 
TOBY: Thank you! 
RYAN: Awesome! 
TOBY: Thanks man!  
KEVIN:  Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging... 
MICHAEL: Oh! You got it? What is that?  
DWIGHT: I have no idea. 
MICHAEL: Huh. Well, maybe those will help.  
DWIGHT: Michael? Please! Come on! 
MATT: Nice to meet you Oscar. 
OSCAR: Nice to meet you Mark! 
MATT: It's Matt. 
OSCAR: Right, Matt.  I know what I'm doing, Pam. 
DWIGHT: Oh man!  I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails... 
MICHAEL: Hi Santa. 
PHYLLIS: Hi Michael.  Mm. 'kay. 
MICHAEL: I'd like to make a wish. 
PHYLLIS: What? 
MICHAEL: I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry. 
PHYLLIS: An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy. Bob 
VANCE: Scott! What in the hell is going on here?  
PHYLLIS: No Bob, we worked it out. 
MICHAEL: You called Bob? 
PHYLLIS: I'm sorry, 
MICHAEL: Come on! Phyllis! 
PHYLLIS: I'm really sorry. It was earlier today. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
PHYLLIS: Hi sweetie. 
BOB: You okay baby? 
PHYLLIS: I'm good baby.  
MICHAEL: Oh God. Get a room Santas! 
MICHAEL: Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays. 
DWIGHT: It's real slippery out here.  
JIM: Oh my God! 
PAM: Twelve drummers drumming.  
ANDY: Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys!  
MICHAEL: Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this 
WAY: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens. 
ERIC: Hi - 
COMPUTRON:  Hello, Eric Ward. Welcome to Dunder Mifflin. I am Computron, your answer to everything. 
ERIC: Hello. 
MICHAEL:  I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron? 
COMPUTRON: Yes. 
MICHAEL: What is the world's largest ocean? 
COMPUTRON: Calculating. Calculating. Pacific! 
MICHAEL: Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh? 
ANDY: Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL. 
MICHAEL: That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant. 
PAM: Hello. 
COMPUTRON: The NFL celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1972. 
PAM: Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao. 
PAM: It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are. 
MICHAEL: Hello, Stanley. Fake 
STANLEY: Hi. 
PAM: For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it. 
ERIC: Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason I'm here. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit - 
ERIC: Right. 
MICHAEL: - since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right? 
ERIC: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it. 
COMPUTRON: Mul Yam in Tel Aviv is better. 
MICHAEL: No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it. 
COMPUTRON: Are you calling me wrong? 
MICHAEL:  Oh, my God. 
ERIC: It's called 'due diligence'. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. I'm a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Excuse me.  If you will - 
RYAN: Michael, do you think I could get a space heater - 
MICHAEL: - follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two.  
DWIGHT: Oh, we will. Have a seat.  
MICHAEL: I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time. 
ERIC: So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character. 
DWIGHT: He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question? 
TOBY: What are, are you doing at my desk? 
DWIGHT: Ignore him. He's the local lunatic. 
TOBY: Come on, Dwight. Get out of here. 
DWIGHT: Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host.  Welcome.  
TOBY: Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help? 
ERIC: Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of? 
TOBY: What do you mean? 
ERIC: Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits. 
TOBY: Um... nothing comes to mind.  
ERIC: So, the staff? 
TOBY: Mm-hmm. 
ERIC: Are people generally happy? 
TOBY:  Happy's a funny word. 
ERIC: In what way? 
TOBY: You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy.  Keep philosophers busy for awhile. 
ERIC: So... generally? 
TOBY: Yes. 
ERIC: Generally. 
TOBY: Generally happy.  
ERIC:  Generally happy. 
ERIC: What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that? 
TOBY: Oh, I don't know. 
ERIC: You, you don't know. 
TOBY: I don't know. 
ERIC: You're the head of Human Resources. 
TOBY: I don't know. No. 
ERIC: Ok.  
TOBY: I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth. 
MICHAEL: Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about? 
TOBY: Well, Eric's just going over some stuff. 
MICHAEL: Stuff. I love stuff. 
TOBY: It's, uh, it's HR stuff. 
MICHAEL: HR stuff?  HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley.  What is that? What kind of stuff is that? 
ERIC: It's uh, it's a company evaluation form. 
MICHAEL: Ah. 
ERIC: Talkin' bout, uh - 
MICHAEL: Talkin' bout, uh, what? 
ERIC: Waste is next. 
MICHAEL: Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage? 
ERIC: No, waste of time and resources. 
MICHAEL: Oh, time and resources. 
TOBY: Look, you know, in any company there's going to be certain degrees - 
MICHAEL: No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever.  
ERIC: Is anyone near retirement age?  
ERIC:  Hey, uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with HR. So... well, I think I'm gonna be here for awhile. 
MICHAEL: This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.  Right? Would you agree with that? 
TOBY: Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about. 
MICHAEL: That's, that is true.  
DWIGHT:  Thank you, so much. 
KEVIN: Thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ERIC: Thank you. It's nice to meet you all. 
PAM: Good to meet you. 
ANGELA: Have a great day. 
DWIGHT: Hope to see you soon. 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin?  
MICHAEL: I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun. 
COMPUTRON: Computron experiencing emotion. 
MICHAEL: Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy? 
COMPUTRON: Ok. 
MICHAEL: Just - sh - 
COMPUTRON:  Please don't. Computron - 
MICHAEL: Shut - 
COMPUTRON: wants to live. 
MICHAEL: Shut up. Shut up. 
MICHAEL:  Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'. 
DWIGHT: Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty. 
MICHAEL: So check out how we live 
BOTH: in the Electric City! 
MICHAEL: They call it Scranton! 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider. 
DWIGHT: But check that it's covered by your 
BOTH: Healthcare Provider! 
MICHAEL: Plenty of space in the parking lot. 
DWIGHT: But the little cars go in the compact spot! 
BOTH: Spot. Spot. Spot. Spot. Spot. 
MICHAEL: Snack attack time. 
DWIGHT: Don't lose your head. 
MICHAEL: We like Cugino's 
BOTH: for the tasty bread. 
MICHAEL: They call it Scranton! 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton! 
DWIGHT:  What? 
MICHAEL: Ugh. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah.  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?  
ERIN:  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?  
OSCAR: I think you don't know what you're saying. 
MICHAEL: It's from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me.  
MICHAEL: Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre.  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses. Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses. 
MICHAEL: Oh!  Wow. Awesome.  For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Here we go.  Oh! Wow. 
MICHAEL: Cool. What next?  
ERIN: Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow? 
MICHAEL: Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control - 
DWIGHT: Impulsivity and inattention to detail. 
MICHAEL: Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened... 
DWIGHT: Terrible mistake. 
MICHAEL: And distributed things which should not have been distributed. 
DWIGHT: Undistributable. 
PAM: Well, maybe we can put the box back together. 
DWIGHT: Impossible. He opened it like an ape. 
OSCAR: I think we can do it. 
PAM:  Yep, yep. 
OSCAR: Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle - 
PAM: Yep. 
OSCAR: Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down? 
PAM: Yes. 
CREED: Have you tried making everything smaller? 
MICHAEL: And -  Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves.  
PAM: Oh, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please.  
PAM: No, don't! 
MICHAEL:  Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok. 
MICHAEL: Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready? 
PAM: What do you want us to do? 
MICHAEL: Why do I have to explain everything? 
PAM: Because we're usually not on the same page. 
MICHAEL: Okay.  
GABE: Oh. Okay. And to you.  
MICHAEL: Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is.  You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons. 
DWIGHT: Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton? 
MICHAEL: You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok? 
GABE: Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions. 
MICHAEL: Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert. 
JIM: Co-manager, actually. 
MICHAEL: In training. 
JIM: Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So... 
GABE: We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger. 
MICHAEL: We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right? 
DWIGHT: So excited. 
MICHAEL: We have a little song prepared for you. 
GABE: Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website.  
MICHAEL: Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre. 
DWIGHT: Oh. Of course. 
MICHAEL: Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys. 
ANDY: Ok.  Andy & 
ERIN:  Hopped off the train in Scranton, PA, another cloudy gray afternoon. Jumped in the cab, here you are for the first time, look to the right see the "Electric City" sign. This is gonna be good day, for Dunder Mifflin and Sob-ray. Sab -  
MICHAEL: Saber. 
ANDY: Saber.  Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Andy & 
ERIN: Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sob-ray. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre.  
ANDY: You sure it's saber? 
PAM: Hey. 
JIM: Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20. 
PAM: Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away. 
JIM: Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute. 
PAM: We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into. 
JIM: Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird. 
PAM: We're hoping our interview seals the deal. 
JIM: But if not, there's always the army. The infantry. 
PAM: Okay. Okay. Yeah.  Christian 
SLATER: So you've just been bought by Sabre. You've probably got a lot of questions. Hi. I'm Christian Slater. What's it like to work for Sabre? Let's find out together. Working at Sabre means taking on the challenge of the road that rises to meet you. Sabre is respecting the past, but opening a window to the future. Have you ever tasted a rainbow? At Sabre, you will. Jo 
BENNETT: You'll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. We're very excited to go on this journey with you. 
JIM:  So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, "What's going on?" Well, you're not alone. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Really terrific. 
GABE: Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper. 
MICHAEL: Perfect. 
MICHAEL: No. Don't like that. 
GABE: At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your - 
MEREDITH: Talk about vacation days! 
GABE: We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks. 
OSCAR: But I banked six weeks. 
ANGELA: I already booked a Great Lakes cruise. 
MEREDITH: Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff? 
GABE: Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites. And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well. 
MICHAEL: Mm, nope. Don't like that. 
GABE: Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment. 
MICHAEL: We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right? 
GABE: Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ? 
MICHAEL: I don't know what they're made of. 
DWIGHT: They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day. 
GABE: Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle. 
MICHAEL: You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley. 
STANLEY: That's ok. 
MICHAEL: There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba - 
MICHAEL:  Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach? 
TOBY: Oop. 
MICHAEL: What? 
TOBY: Looks like we kicked it.  
MICHAEL: I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate. 
MICHAEL: I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us. 
GABE: Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so... 
MICHAEL: Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em. 
GABE: Which ones? 
MICHAEL: All of them. 
GABE: Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know? 
MICHAEL: So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups? 
GABE: You know what? Let me see what I can do. 
JIM:  Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies. 
PAM: There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here? 
JIM: Oh. Adorable, right?  I walked in on someone in the bathroom. 
PAM: What? 
JIM: I just walked in on someone in the bathroom. 
PAM: Who? The - 
JIM: I don't know. I don't know. 
PAM: The guy we're meeting with? 
JIM: I don't know, I don't know. 
ANDY: I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here. 
ERIN: Well, I saw them in there. 
ANDY: Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like,  "Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries." 
ERIN: I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with. 
ANDY: The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing. 
GABE:  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so... 
JO: Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now. 
GABE: Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have  really been proud of the way... Okay, um... 
JO: Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you?  I want to see who it is. Turn me around. 
GABE: I don't - it's just... 
JO: Turn me around. Now.  Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said? 
MICHAEL: Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello. 
JO: Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you. 
MICHAEL: Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent. 
JO: Aw, thank you. I've been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat? 
MICHAEL: Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and - 
JO: Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson's snowball company, so you'll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things. 
MICHAEL: Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do. 
JO: So listen, why don't you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you can't handle the changes. 
MICHAEL: I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help. 
JO: I would take until the end of the day if I were you.   
JERRY: Pam and Jim? Hey, I'm Jerry. 
PAM: Hi Jerry. 
JIM: Jerry. 
JERRY: Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room. 
JIM: This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh - 
JERRY: Oh, so you saw it already? 
JIM: No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular. 
PAM: It's lovely. 
JERRY:  Oh. Got to take this. Sorry. 
JIM: Do it. 
JERRY: Okay. Hi, this is Jerry. 
PAM: Ok, you've got to pull it together. 
JIM: We should just go. He's really uncomfortable. 
PAM: He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird. 
JIM: What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open? 
PAM: That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem. 
JERRY: Sorry about that. Right this way. 
JIM: All right. 
MICHAEL: I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre.  He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is?  Hey. Hi, sorry. 
DAVID: Michael. 
MICHAEL: I hope you're not busy doing something. 
DAVID: No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on. 
MICHAEL: You sure? 
DAVID: You look great. 
MICHAEL: You look great too. 
DAVID: You hungry? I'm just having lunch. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah, that sounds good. 
DAVID: Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in. Teddy 
WALLACE: Huh? Hey.  
MICHAEL: Hey. Wow. 
DAVID: Keep it up, son. 
MICHAEL: Really loud. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Oh, yummy.  You have got the life, my friend. 
DAVID: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Can I just stay here and never go back? 
DAVID: Things not going so well there? 
MICHAEL: Oh, man. How much time do you have? 
DAVID: I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Mrs. 
WALLACE: Hey, honey. How's your day going? Did you do anything cool? 
DAVID: Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out. Mrs. 
WALLACE: Oh, 'cause I saw you had shoes on, so I didn't know if you did anything. 
DAVID: No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see... Mrs. 
WALLACE: No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. 
DAVID: Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside.  Outside. 
JIM: There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit. 
JERRY: That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, and you're already lining up your holiday plans. 
JIM: Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes. 
JERRY: Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it. 
PAM: Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom? 
JIM: What? 
JERRY: Seriously? You told her? 
JIM: Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you. 
JERRY: And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going? 
JIM: No. 
PAM: Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well. 
JERRY: Well, you didn't consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well? 
PAM: Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us. 
JERRY: I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are? 
JIM: Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man? 
JERRY: It doesn't lock for the children's safety. 
JIM: Anybody could have walked in. 
JERRY: It was story time. 
MICHAEL: Sabre is changing everything.  Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace? 
DAVID: I don't know. I mean, what can you do? 
MICHAEL: Exactly. What are you thinking? 
DAVID: I, I - It's a tough one. 
MICHAEL: It is a tough one. 
DAVID: I don't have any ideas for you there. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. But one would be good. 
DAVID: Hey, oh, okay. Wait. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DAVID: I want to tell you about a business idea I have. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DAVID: Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing.  Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks.  Picks it up! 
MICHAEL: So the kid's making the noise to pick it up. 
DAVID: No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. 
DAVID: You-you don't like it. 
MICHAEL: No, I think it is- 
DAVID: No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac.  Did I say that? 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
DAVID: It'll be ok. 
ANDY: Hey, any fun weekend plans? 
ERIN: No, you? 
ANDY: Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to? 
ERIN: Nothing. It's wide open. 
ANDY: Okay. 
ANDY: That's as hard as I can hint. 
DAVID: Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again. 
MICHAEL: The what? 
DAVID: Suck it. That's what it's called. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. 
DAVID: Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it. 
MICHAEL: Like it. 
MICHAEL: There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em. 
MICHAEL: See you later.  
DAVID: Oh, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Bye now. 
DAVID: Thank you for coming. 
MICHAEL: Thanks for having me. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember.  That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here. 
MICHAEL: Hello.  Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go. 
MICHAEL: You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm not really one for making speeches. 
EVERYONE: Yes. Yes, you are. You make a lot. 
MICHAEL: But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you. 
ANGELA: That's your toast? 
MICHAEL: No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud. 
MICHAEL: Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good. 
KEVIN: Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast. 
MICHAEL: Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre. 
ALL: To us and to Sabre. 
MICHAEL: Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.  
DAVID:  Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it. 
TEDDY: Suck it! 
DAVID: Yeah! 
TEDDY: Suck it! 
DAVID: Yeah! 
TEDDY: Suck it! 
DAVID: Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll... 
TEDDY: Suck it! 
DAVID: Yeah! 
TEDDY: Suck it! 
DAVID: Yeah! 
BOTH: Take out my Suck It and we'll suck it. 
DAVID: Yeah! Teddy! 
TEDDY: Yeah.  Hotel 
EMPLOYEE:  Vancouver Court Hotel, how many I help you? 
MICHAEL: Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America! I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics. Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: Well, we are looking forward to having you, so, let me just pull up your information here... 
MICHAEL: Okey doke. Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: Um, I don't seem to have it, sir. 
MICHAEL: What? 
DWIGHT:  I'm not seeing anything under "confirmation." 
MICHAEL: No. 
DWIGHT: Could it be under "affirmation?" Cause you have thousands of those. 
MICHAEL: No.  We're trying to look it up right now. 
DWIGHT: You did get the e-vite to my barbeque! 
MICHAEL: Um, come on. 
DWIGHT: Michael... Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we've been fully booked for months. 
MICHAEL: Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation. 
DWIGHT: Wait, I got it! Confirmation 
CODE: XV2RDM! Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: ...Oh, here it is. Yep. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single? 
MICHAEL: That's it! Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize. Michael and 
DWIGHT: Uh-huh, okay... Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: Yeah, how may I help you Mr. Scott? 
MICHAEL: Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please. Hotel 
EMPLOYEE: There is a cancellation fee for this, sir. 
MICHAEL: Okay, put it on my card. 
MICHAEL: Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English? 
MICHAEL:  Why hello! 
GABE: This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch. 
MICHAEL: Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett. 
JO: Oh, that's Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the "Mrs." just to piss off the new wife. Well, let's take a gander around this place. 
ANDY:  These sure are pretty dogs... 
JO: They love a good crotch. 
ANDY: They sure do. 
JO: You should take that as a compliment! 
ANDY: Oh, I do! 
JO:  Hello. 
DWIGHT: Hello. 
JO: Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room? 
DWIGHT: I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy. 
JO: I like that. 
GABE: This is Accounting. 
KEVIN: Hi! 
JO: Good-looking group. 
GABE: Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton. 
JO: Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea? 
GABE: That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office. 
JO:  I thought this guy was the manager? 
GABE: Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager. 
JO: Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that! 
ANDY: Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers. 
ANGELA:  No, no! 
KEVIN: What, no candy? 
ANDY: Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem "too eager," so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit. 
ANDY: : Look alive. 
MEREDITH: Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat! 
MEREDITH: Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat. 
MICHAEL: Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job. 
JIM: Whoa, whoa. 
MICHAEL: Whoa, whoa! 
JIM: I'll take over. Um, what we're doing 
HERE: Michael handles more of the "big-picture" stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together... 
JO: Yeah. I think I understand. 
JIM: Alright. 
JO: Each of you is doing half a job. 
JIM: No. 
MICHAEL: And sometimes I can hardly handle that! 
JO: This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim? 
JIM: I don't think so. 
JO: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Forget the question... 
JO: I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager. 
MICHAEL: I humbly accept the management position. 
JIM: I... Why would you just say something like that? 
MICHAEL: Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of 
FOLK: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now. 
JIM: Do you even know what that means? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
JO: Well, I'm gonna let this marinate. So you can go. 
JIM: Um... 
JO: You can go on. Shoo! 
JO: I'm Jolene Bennett, Jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, and now I have my own pilot's license. I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you. 
ANDY:  Whoa-oh, traffic jam! 
ERIN: Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three! 
ANDY:  Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep! 
ERIN: Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up! 
ANDY: There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card. 
ERIN:  Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog! 
ANDY: Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock. 
ERIN: You named them? 
ANDY: Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember? 
ERIN: Uh, yeah I do remember.  Aw, they love each other. 
ANDY: Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed. 
ERIN: Wow, it smells really good too. 
ANDY: Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there. 
ERIN: Andy, whoa! Thank you very much! 
ANDY: It's got pheromones in it. 
JO: Hey! 
KEVIN: Hi. 
JO:  Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion! 
KEVIN: Jo, there's books in my chair. 
JO: That's right, darlin', now you're the proud new owner of a Sabre handbook and my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces, I mean, what's going on now? I mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin? Right? I mean, Sabre? What's that? Some company I've never heard of? Down in Tallahassee? Where is that? Near Mars? 
MICHAEL: No, we know. Texas! 
JO: Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm's reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we're gonna take that arm, and we're gonna start selling printers. 
MICHAEL: I could manage my way around that. 
JO: They're the easiest-to-use printers on the market. 
MICHAEL: I will try to manage my excitement! 
MICHAEL: I have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever Jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa. 
JO: I think that's it. So we're all good!  Thanks ya'll. 
DWIGHT:  I, uh... 
KELLY:  Oh my God. 
KELLY: I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual. 
PAM: So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year. 
JIM: This is way more than I make now. 
JIM: I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women. 
JIM: Hey, you got a second? 
MICHAEL: Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk? 
JIM: Actually, yeah. 
MICHAEL: What? 
JIM: Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do. 
MICHAEL: What? Really? 
JIM: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Wow! 
MICHAEL: La la la, hello Oscar! 
OSCAR: Michael. Reading. 
MICHAEL: What are you reading? 
OSCAR: The Atlantic. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again. 
OSCAR: I should step into sales myself. 
MICHAEL: Why, is there an untapped gay market? 
OSCAR: Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales. 
MICHAEL: ...Where did you get that information. 
OSCAR: Manual. 
MICHAEL: Manuel who? 
MICHAEL: Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled. 
MICHAEL: Son of a bitch.  Pardon me. 
JO: Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat! 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
JO: Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager. 
MICHAEL: Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales. 
JO: Really? 
JIM: Really. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman. 
JO: Well, I think you're both being a little too modest. 
JIM: No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons. 
MICHAEL: No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people. 
JIM: Why would you do that? 
MICHAEL: I'm turning myself in right now! 
JO: You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I'm gonna defer to your judgment. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
JO: I think you  will become the salesman, and congratulations!  You're gonna be the new manager of this branch! 
MICHAEL: Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss. 
PAM:  Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown! 
JIM: Mm! 
DWIGHT:  Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds.  89... 88... 
DWIGHT: You're twenty minutes late! 
RYAN:  Um, I was at another dumpster! 
DWIGHT: Just admit you lost track of time. 
DWIGHT: Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair. 
RYAN: Did you see Saw? 
DWIGHT: Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time. 
RYAN: No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw? 
DWIGHT: Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw. 
RYAN: Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment. 
DWIGHT: I like where you're going with this. Continue. 
RYAN: Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something? 
DWIGHT: I have an old barn! 
RYAN: Yes! 
DWIGHT: It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what? 
RYAN: We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask... 
DWIGHT: Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life! 
RYAN: Well suggest something else then! Don't just... 
DWIGHT: He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think! 
RYAN: Don't just criticize my idea! 
DWIGHT: Think! 
RYAN: You think of something then! 
ERIN: Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk. 
MICHAEL: How is that possible? 
ERIN: Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space. 
MICHAEL: No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen. 
ERIN: You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers?  Michael Scott, head of sales. 
JIM:  You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there. 
DWIGHT: The new IT guy. Nick. 
RYAN: Nick. 
DWIGHT: I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it. 
RYAN: Like Frodo! 
DWIGHT: Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock? 
RYAN: Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum. 
DWIGHT: Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum. 
DWIGHT: I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one. 
ERIN: Who's hungry? 
JIM: What is that? 
ERIN: It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say "Who's hungry?" 
JIM: Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though. 
ERIN: Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy? 
JIM: Why would I wanna do that? 
ERIN: It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain. 
JIM: For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here... 
ERIN: Oh sure. 
JIM: Yeah. Thank you. 
ERIN: Well. 
MICHAEL:  It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye.  I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called "Curves." I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it! 
KEVIN: Nice! 
DWIGHT: You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much. 
MICHAEL: Why not? It's part of the sales experience. 
DWIGHT: It's not really 1992 anymore. 
MICHAEL: Well, okay... 
KELLY:  You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me. 
ERIN: Geez louise. 
KELLY: I know, obsessed with me much? 
ERIN: Well, everyone got one. 
KELLY: What did yours say? 
ERIN: Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with. 
ERIN: It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all. 
DWIGHT: Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room. 
NICK: Uh, yep. 
DWIGHT: I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords. 
NICK: No, I actually don't. 
DWIGHT: Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him. 
NICK: I think that you should call the cops. 
DWIGHT: No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer. 
NICK: I don't know what to tell you, man. I'm sorry, I just can't give out his password like that. 
RYAN: Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you. 
NICK: Are you... you threatening me? 
RYAN: Threatening you? No.  
MICHAEL: What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here? 
PAM: Michael, stop. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs? 
PAM: Michael... 
MICHAEL: You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps. 
DWIGHT: Michael, it's Phyllis. 
MICHAEL: No, this is geological. 
PHYLLIS: I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on. 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding me? 
PHYLLIS: No. 
MICHAEL: And you guys are okay with this? 
DWIGHT: She sent an email, so. 
PHYLLIS: I did. 
ANDY:  It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God. 
KELLY: Oh! You scared me! 
ANDY: I'm sorry, I thought you saw me. 
KELLY: I didn't see you. And you were there all along.  Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go. 
ANDY: Cool, thanks. 
KELLY: Bye, Andy.  
ANDY: ...That was weird. 
MEREDITH: No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her. 
ANDY: I don't even know what that card said. 
MEREDITH: Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
MICHAEL: You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here. 
JIM: Well, the grass is always greener. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch. 
JIM: Well, it's what you wanted. 
MICHAEL: I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here. 
JIM: For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do. 
MICHAEL: We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black. 
JIM: Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her. 
MICHAEL: Lethal Weapon? 
JIM: That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way. 
JO: You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management? 
MICHAEL: What? What I'm saying... 
JIM: Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly. 
MICHAEL: And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys?  See? They love me. 
JO: Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it. 
JIM: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright! 
JO:  Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don't ride 'em. Lotta people try to ride 'em. 
ANDY:  Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following 
MESSAGE: "Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way." 
PHYLLIS: You don't even like us as friends? 
ANDY: Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you. 
OSCAR: What are we, five? 
ANDY: "Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog." 
KELLY:  Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy? 
ANDY: It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else. 
KELLY: Who? 
ANDY: It's not... Whether or not, you... 
KELLY: Who, what? 
ERIN: Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that? 
MICHAEL: Oh, it smells good in here. 
ERIN: Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator. 
MICHAEL: Erin, what about my keyboard?  Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova? 
ERIN: Oh!  
PAM:  He looks happy. 
JIM: Yep. 
DWIGHT: Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he  what? Michael! 
DWIGHT:  I can't help but think that something we did made this possible. 
RYAN: Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel. 
DWIGHT: Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink? 
RYAN: I would love to.  Why not? 
DWIGHT: Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you. 
RYAN: Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know. 
DWIGHT: It is not "farm boy swill," I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious. 
RYAN: I am not interested in anything I have to make myself! 
PAM:  I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks. 
DWIGHT: Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales. 
JIM:  Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely. 
DWIGHT: No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably! 
PAM: There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it. 
DWIGHT:  Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay. 
DWIGHT: I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd. 
PAM: Kevin, you're such a gourmand. 
KEVIN: I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken. 
PAM: Hmm. 
KEVIN: Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner. 
KEVIN: I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast. 
PAM: Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking? 
KEVIN: I think it should be a surprise. 
MEREDITH:  Oh, getting there, huh? 
PAM: No, no. I still have time. 
PAM: I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor. 
JIM: Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO. 
PAM: If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors. 
JIM: Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy. 
PAM: I cannot wait for that joke to be over. 
PAM: Ooh. 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car... 
JIM: Michael. 
MICHAEL: Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money. 
JIM: Michael, you shouldn't have done that. 
MICHAEL: Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office. 
PAM: You know the baby's not going to live here, right? 
MICHAEL: Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too. 
JIM: Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital! 
PAM: Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight. 
ERIN: Ooh, spooky. But why? 
JIM: Because the insurance company only covers two nights. 
PAM: Everything's fine. We have plenty of time. 
NICK: Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music. 
MICHAEL: Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd. 
ANGELA:  What are you looking at? 
DWIGHT: Ha, nerd. 
KELLY: Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself. 
DWIGHT:  Bare my child. 
ANGELA: Excuse me? 
DWIGHT: I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out. 
JIM:  That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on. 
PAM: Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet. 
JIM: Are you serious? Pam. 
PAM: No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes. 
JIM: I... Pam, please. 
PAM: I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight. 
ANDY: Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate. 
PAM: Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks. 
JIM: Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart. 
PAM: Five minutes apart. 
JIM: So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant. 
PAM: Okay, stop watching me. 
JIM: Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check? 
PAM: Not until midnight. 
ANDY: Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds. 
ERIN: I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr. 
ANDY: My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book. 
JIM: You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore. 
JIM:  Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals. 
PAM: Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it. 
MICHAEL: Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go! 
MICHAEL: Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  
MICHAEL: The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body. 
ANDY: Can we do sleight of hand tricks? 
MICHAEL: I will allow that. 
ANDY: Yes! Can anyone do those? 
STANLEY: I'm going to go look at the Internet. 
JIM:  Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one. 
PAM: Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
KELLY: Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior. 
PAM: Oh, thanks, Kelly. 
MICHAEL: Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills? 
PAM: Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request. 
MICHAEL: Yes, Phyl? 
PHYLLIS: I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club. 
MICHAEL:  Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that. 
ANDY: I can do the evolution of dance-dance. 
MICHAEL:  That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay. 
ANDY: Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay...  You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance. 
RYAN:  "You let me in your bed. But now, I sleep alone. Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home." 
ERIN:  Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. Assault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. War Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star Shoot. 
ANGELA: Good afternoon. 
DWIGHT: Have a seat. 
ANGELA: What is this? 
DWIGHT: Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract. 
ANGELA: Of course. 
DWIGHT: It's been a long time since we've come down here separately. 
ANGELA: You know I was thinking... 
DWIGHT: Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item 
ONE:  Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed? 
ANGELA: Agreed. 
MICHAEL:  Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there. 
KEVIN: For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast! 
JIM: Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know... 
PAM: Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times. 
JIM: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one. 
ERIN: Um, stimulate the nipples. 
MICHAEL: Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle. 
KEVIN: Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt. 
MEREDITH: I have a shirt like that in my car. 
MICHAEL: Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it? 
ERIN: Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods. 
MICHAEL: Okay, the opposite of that? 
KEVIN: Stick spicy food up her butt. 
JIM: Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now. 
PAM: Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry. 
PAM: Why don't you go do some work? 
JIM: Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled. 
PAM: I know, you don't like to be frazzled. 
JIM: No, I don't. 
PAM: Okay. 
JIM: Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally. 
MICHAEL: Ooh, someone's freakin'. 
ANDY: A little frazzled. 
MICHAEL: I think he is. 
JIM: I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes. 
DWIGHT: Acceptable names include and are limited 
TO: Ebenezer. 
ANGELA: Jedediah. 
DWIGHT: Jonas. 
ANGELA: Jedediah. 
DWIGHT: Warf. 
ANGELA: No Star Trek names. 
DWIGHT: Okay. Fine. 
ANGELA: What if it's a girl? 
DWIGHT: Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male. 
ANGELA: Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here. 
DWIGHT: Yes you can. 
ANGELA: No. 
DWIGHT: It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months. 
ANGELA: Absolutely not. 
JIM:  Hey. 
PAM: Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital. 
JIM: Ah, you know me too well. 
PAM: Okay, Jim. 
JIM: Yeah? ... Oh. 
PAM: Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay? 
JIM: Did you say "she?" 
PAM: I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad. 
JIM: Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man. 
PAM: I know. 
JIM: Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better. 
PAM: Good. 
JIM: Yeah. 
PAM: Okay. 
JIM: Alright... Hey, did you change? 
PAM: Oh, yeah, my water broke. 
JIM: Oh. Oh... 
PAM:  Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow. 
MICHAEL: Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet? 
PHYLLIS: No, it's 4:35. 
MICHAEL: 4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we? 
PAM: No, not yet, Michael. 
MICHAEL: We can do... 
PAM: Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin? 
MICHAEL: Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital? 
OSCAR: That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony. 
MICHAEL: What is October feast? 
PAM: There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there. 
KEVIN: Our ultra feast menu's 
THEME: Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay? 
PAM: Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital. 
JIM: Alright. Time to go. Okay. 
MICHAEL: That's right, let's do this. 
JIM: Let's give it a shot. 
PAM: Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine. 
JIM: Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital. 
PAM: They're not that bad still, babe. 
JIM: Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital. 
PAM: No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay. 
JIM: Come on, Michael says we should go now. 
MICHAEL: Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out. 
PAM: No, it's passing, it's fine. 
JIM: Pam. 
PAM: Ah, no, it passed. It's good. 
JIM: You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital. 
PAM: Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine.  Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it. 
JIM: Hey, are you kidding me? 
MICHAEL: Are you kidding? 
JIM: If anyone can do this, you can do this. 
MICHAEL: You can do this. You can do this. 
JIM: Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared. 
MICHAEL: I'm scared, too. 
KEVIN: I'm petrified. 
JIM: The best news is, we're going to have a baby today. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
JIM: A really awesome baby. 
MICHAEL: We're going to have a baby. 
JIM: So let's have it at the hospital. 
MICHAEL: Let's do that. 
JIM: How are we doing on contractions? 
MICHAEL: Two minutes apart. 
JIM: Two minutes... 
PAM: Oh, God. Oh, no. 
JIM: Michael, I told you. 
MICHAEL: It's okay. 
JIM: No, I told you to warn me at five minutes. 
PAM: Jim, we waited too long! 
MICHAEL: I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon. 
JIM: We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes? 
MICHAEL: We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is? 
PAM: I don't want to have my baby here. 
MICHAEL: You're not going to. You know where you're going? 
PAM: The hospital. 
MICHAEL: Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have? 
PAM: A baby. 
MICHAEL: Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby. 
MICHAEL: I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please! 
DWIGHT: No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops. 
JIM: Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually. 
MICHAEL: No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it. 
JIM: Alright, I have my wallet. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
JIM: Go bag's in the car... Keys, my keys, where's my keys? 
MICHAEL: Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag? 
ERIN: There's nothing in it. 
MICHAEL: You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital? 
OSCAR: The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus! 
DWIGHT: Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous! 
PAM: Dwight, get away! 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please. 
ERIN: I didn't know we had a tape measure. 
DWIGHT:  "We" don't. 
JIM: Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here. Dwight, Jim and 
MICHAEL: Here we go! 
PHYLLIS: Good luck! 
NICK: Good luck, Pam! 
MICHAEL: Thank you! Wish me luck! 
CREED: Have fun!  
MEREDITH: Hey, it's 5:00! 
MICHAEL:  Here we go! Here we go! On our way! 
STANLEY: Hold it! 
MICHAEL: Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now! 
TOBY: Oh, one more! 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, what is the traffic like? 
DWIGHT: Doesn't matter. I'll escort you! 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
DWIGHT: Let's go! 
MICHAEL: Geesh, Dwight! 
DWIGHT:  Michael! 
MICHAEL: What!? 
DWIGHT: This is where I saw that deer last week. 
MICHAEL: Where? 
DWIGHT: Right over by that fence. 
MICHAEL: By the bushes? 
JIM: Okay, Michael! Focus! 
MICHAEL: Okay, go, go, go, go! 
DWIGHT: Let's go! 
DWIGHT: I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends. 
JIM: Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon. 
MICHAEL: Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised. 
PAM: Michael! 
MICHAEL: Yeah? 
PAM: Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on. 
JIM: Michael, come on! 
MICHAEL: I'm texting about you, okay!? 
DWIGHT: Ugh, alright.  Let's move! ... What? 
POLICEMAN: Pull over! 
DWIGHT: Are you kidding me? 
POLICEMAN: Pull over!  You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Don't make this difficult, Dwight! 
PAM: Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here! 
JIM: Okay. 
PAM: It has the birth song on it! 
JIM: Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine. 
PAM: Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack. 
JIM: Okay, so what do you want to do? 
PAM: I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital! 
JIM: Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now. 
MICHAEL: Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go.  Ready? 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute. 
MICHAEL: Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday. 
DWIGHT: Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
PAM: Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under... 
DWIGHT: I don't need a key. 
PAM: Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the... 
DWIGHT: No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala. 
PAM: Dwight just listen! It's underneath...  
MICHAEL: Okay. 
JIM: Wait, you alright? 
PAM: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Do you have everything, guys? 
JIM: Michael, just go park the car. 
MICHAEL: Okay, alright.  Hospital 
EMPLOYEE: Sir! You can't park here! 
MICHAEL: Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay.  I just did. 
JIM: Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good. 
NURSE: Daddy? She's ready to push. 
JIM: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go. 
JIM:  Doing great, push again. 
DOCTOR: Not yet. 
JIM: No, don't push. Pull. Pull. 
NURSE: Why don't you get more ice chips? 
PAM: No, Jim, stay! 
DOCTOR: Okay. Really push this time, Pam. 
PAM: Okay. 
MICHAEL:  Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes. 
MICHAEL: That kid's going to have a lot of hair. 
ANDY: Hey, have you guys seen her? 
MEREDITH: She hasn't popped yet. 
ANDY: What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday. 
ANDY: I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper. 
PHYLLIS: This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here. 
MICHAEL: I think it's going to be any minute now. 
PHYLLIS: But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour. 
MICHAEL: Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do? 
PHYLLIS: I have an ice cream cake in the car. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright. 
MICHAEL:  Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna... 
PAM: This is happening! 
MICHAEL: You're starting, you're kinda losing them. 
JIM: Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God. 
PAM: Oh, my God. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see? 
DOCTOR: Sir! Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Put it, put it out. 
MICHAEL: Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days. 
PAM:  She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again? 
JIM: No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each. 
PAM: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Guys, guys! 
JIM: Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert. 
MICHAEL: Eleven pounds... 
JIM: She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great. 
EVERYONE: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Thank you! Thank you! 
OSCAR: Congratulations. That's great. (Pam's mom) 
HELEEN: Hi there. 
JIM: Hey, grandma's back. 
HELENE: Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee. 
JIM: Great. 
PAM: Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months. 
HELENE: Ooh, somebody has a full diaper. 
JIM: Oh. Let me get it. 
JIM: I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you. 
MICHAEL: Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma. 
HELENE: Hello, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you. 
HELENE: I'm, uh... You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go. 
PAM: Okay. 
HELENE: Love you. 
MICHAEL: Love you, as a friend. 
PAM: Love you, mom. 
MICHAEL: Ooh, I want to hold the baby! 
PAM: Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
PAM: Again, no pants. 
MICHAEL: Oh, okay. 
JIM: Ready? 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael. 
JIM: It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here. 
DWIGHT: Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work . 
MICHAEL: There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family. 
ANDY: This man has a gift! 
MICHAEL: Who else here is single? 
KELLY: I'm not single. I have a man.  
MICHAEL: I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too. 
STANLEY: Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs? 
MICHAEL: Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  Who else? Come on! People, I know models! 
RYAN: Ha ha, plus size models, maybe. 
MICHAEL: Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single. 
MEREDITH: You know it. I am never getting married. 
MEREDITH: Like Clooney. 
MICHAEL: Andrew, what about you? 
ANDY: Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing. 
ANDY: Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible. 
MICHAEL: Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love. 
PAM: Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents? 
JIM: We were just kids. What did we know? 
NURSE: How we doing? 
JIM: Great. 
PAM: Good. 
NURSE: Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night? 
PAM: Doesn't she sleep here? 
NURSE: She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot. 
JIM: I think we'll be okay. 
NURSE: Okay, great. 
PAM:  Oh, big yawn. 
JIM: Ready? One, two, three... 
PAM: One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down. 
JIM: I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it. 
PAM: She's not gonna... Just... 
JIM: I got it. Alright. 
PAM: Go. 
JIM: Nurse! 
JIM: How you doing? 
PAM: I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything. 
JIM: Really? 
PAM: Doesn't feel right. 
JIM: Well, you're pushing the milk out, right? 
PAM: How does one do that? 
JIM: Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that. 
PAM: Do you want to try it, Jim? 
JIM: I think you're good. Doing a good job. 
NURSE: Somebody buzzed? 
JIM: Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam. 
PAM: I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right. 
NURSE: Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later. 
PAM: Even if she's not getting anything? 
NURSE: Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery. 
PAM: No. I read in the book about nipple confusion. 
NURSE: Oh, good. You know everything. 
PAM: She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up. 
NURSE: Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay? 
JIM: Alright. 
NURSE: Alright. 
JIM: It's going to be alright. 
PAM: Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies. 
JIM: Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good. 
ERIN:  You wanted to see me? 
MICHAEL: What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life? 
ERIN: Oh, boy! ... What's that sound? 
KEVIN:  Ta-da! 
MICHAEL: I would like you to meet your new boyfriend. 
KEVIN: Yes! 
ERIN: I don't know what to say. 
KEVIN: Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me. 
MICHAEL: Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together? 
KEVIN: Erin, would you have lunch with me? 
ERIN: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Good! 
KEVIN: Yes! 
ERIN: Michael, could I talk to you privately? 
MICHAEL: Sure. Kevin, please leave. 
KEVIN: Bye. 
MICHAEL: Bye. 
ERIN: I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy. 
MICHAEL: Okay. This is going to kill Kevin. 
ERIN: I'm sure he'll be fine. 
MICHAEL: I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah. 
ERIN: Really? 
MICHAEL: No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though. 
ERIN: I don't want anyone to die. 
MICHAEL: Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
ERIN: Hi. 
KEVIN: She touched my shoulder. 
NURSE: Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy. 
JIM: Oh, hi. 
KATHY: Hi. 
DALE: Hi, so sorry. 
JIM: Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there. 
PAM: I know. 
JIM: You see that? I'm pretty sure she's... Hi.  
ERIN: Did you grow up around here? 
KEVIN: No. 
ERIN: So, you must have grown up around somewhere else? 
KEVIN: Yes. 
ANDY: Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like "Oh, this guy's going to fail this class," or, "What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, "Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted." ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous. Hospital 
EMPLOYEE: Uh, hi, Pam Halpert? 
PAM: Yes? Hospital 
EMPLOYEE: Hi. I'm Clark. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant. 
PAM: Um, yeah, that would be great. 
JIM: Yup. Really great. When's she available? 
CLARK: Actually, uh, I'm the consultant. Got milk? Ha ha. Alright, let's see what we're working with. 
PAM: So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch... 
CLARK: I'll get that for you. 
PAM: Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything. 
CLARK: Okay. Let me feel here. 
PAM: Okay. 
CLARK: Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand. 
PAM: Okay. 
CLARK: When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C. Uh, does that hurt? 
PAM: No, I mean, it feels... pressure. 
CLARK: Okay. 
JIM: Are you sure it doesn't hurt? 
PAM: No. It just feels like pressure. 
CLARK: Okay, well. Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that? 
JIM: Yup. 
CLARK: Stimulate it. 
JIM: Yeah. 
CLARK: Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh... 
JIM: Perfect. 
CLARK: And you can just... The baby should grab on to that. 
JIM: I think she will. 
PAM: Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if... 
JIM: We'll figure it out. 
CLARK: It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful. 
PAM: Okay. Aw, thank you. 
CLARK: Yes, congratulations. 
JIM: Thank you. 
CLARK: Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay? 
PAM: Okay. 
JIM: Please do. 
PAM: Oh, shoot. 
JIM: What? 
PAM: Shoot, she fell off. 
JIM: Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing. 
PAM: Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick? 
JIM: No need. I saw him do it. I can try it. 
PAM: Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it. 
JIM: Okay, I'll just go get the other guy. 
DWIGHT:  Hey, what's up, kid? 
ANGELA: Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you? 
DWIGHT: Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon? 
ANGELA: I look forward to it. 
DWIGHT: Very well. 
ANGELA: Goodbye. 
PAM:  Jim, Jim, get her. 
JIM: Hmm? 
PAM: Get the baby. Get her. Come on. 
JIM: Okay. Sshh. I know.  
PAM: I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched. 
JIM: That's amazing. 
PAM: Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the "C thing." 
JIM: That's awesome. 
PAM: Aw, we're doing it. 
JIM: that's great. 
PAM: We're really parents now. 
JIM: Mm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Kevin. Erin would like a few words with you. 
ERIN: Hey. 
KEVIN: Hi. 
ERIN: I have really enjoyed our time together. 
KEVIN: Yeah, me too. 
ERIN: I want to continue working on our friendship. 
KEVIN: Really, really fun. 
ERIN: Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing. 
KEVIN: Yeah, me too. 
ERIN: And, you're my friend. 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
ERIN: And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe... 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin? 
KEVIN: You said she liked me. 
MICHAEL: Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place. 
KEVIN: I've dumped better than Erin. 
MICHAEL: No. 
KEVIN: Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Lynn was as hot as Erin. 
KEVIN: Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you. 
MICHAEL: This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy? 
ANDY:  Ow. 
MICHAEL: Kev... Nice. Going. 
ERIN: Well... 
ISABELLE: Knock knock. 
PAM: Oh, hey, Isabelle. 
JIM: Hey. 
ISABELLE: Hey. Pam, she's gorgeous. Can I hold her? 
PAM: Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby! 
JIM: What? 
PAM: Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh. 
JIM: Okay, okay. 
PAM: Oh, my gosh. 
KATHY:  Oh,has she been fussing long? 
PAM: No, not at all. 
JIM: Perfect. 
KATHY: I was out like a light... Oh, she's not hungry... 
NURSE: How's it going? 
PAM: Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di... 
JIM: Ha ha ha. 
NURSE: Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home? 
JIM: We definitely are. At 3:00, right? You said we could stay until 3:00? 
NURSE: Yeah, you can. It's 2:35. 
JIM: Half hour. 
NURSE: Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat? 
JIM: Yes, car seat's right there. 
NURSE: That bottom part needs to go in the car. 
JIM: Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car. 
NURSE: Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes. 
JIM: Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be... Can we get a late checkout? I don't... I don't think she heard me. 
ISABELLE:  Hello? Dwight? What, what are you doing here? 
DWIGHT: Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so... 
ISABELLE: Wow, ha. New cabinets. 
DWIGHT: Yup. 
ISABELLE: All I did was bring macaroni and cheese... Where's the fridge? 
DWIGHT: Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this. 
ISABELLE: Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it. 
DWIGHT: Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun. 
ISABELLE: Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too. 
DWIGHT: Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha. 
ISABELLE: Yeah... 
DWIGHT: Alright. I'll call you, kid. 
ISABELLE: Do that. 
JIM: Are you really sure we should be leaving? Hospital 
EMPLOYEE: Yeah. 
JIM: But you hear the baby crying, right? Hospital 
EMPLOYEE: Mm-hmm... Where's your car? 
JIM: Uh, it's in the lot. Hospital 
EMPLOYEE: Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around. 
JIM: Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back. 
PAM: Okay, please hurry. 
ANDY: Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation. 
ERIN: Okay, good. 
ANDY: The fax says "Erin, will you have dinner with me?" from Andy, and the number is our office fax number. 
ERIN: It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit? 
ANDY: Sorry, that's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired. 
ERIN:  You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today. 
ANDY: Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax. 
ERIN: You read the fax. 
ANDY: I'm... I'm asking you out. 
ERIN: Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner. 
ANDY: So, it's a date. 
ERIN: Yes. Do you have a day in mind? 
ANDY: Yeah, what day? What day? 
ERIN: Everyday is fine. Or... 
ANDY: Well, that, what's that one? 
ERIN: Thursday? 
ANDY: Okay. Let's do it. 
ERIN: Okay. Hospital 
EMPLOYEE: Would you like me to help you up out of the chair? 
PAM: Oh, yeah, sorry. Hospital 
EMPLOYEE: Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today. 
PAM: Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it. 
JIM: Five tickets on the windshield... Hey. 
PAM: Hi. We did it. 
JIM: You used my move, didn't you? 
PAM: I used a variation of your move. 
MICHAEL:  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick... 
DWIGHT: Two forms of ID, please. 
ANGELA: And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it? 
DWIGHT: Nothing. 
ANGELA: Alright. How would you like to celebrate? 
DWIGHT: Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick...  I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair. 
MICHAEL: Hello hello. Top of the morning to you! Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra!  Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day. 
KELLY: I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us? 
RYAN: Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups. 
KELLY: Well why don't you invite your friends? 
RYAN: Why are you being so weird about this? 
MEREDITH: Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids. 
RYAN: Why no kids? 
KELLY: Yeah, where are your kids? 
MEREDITH: Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today! 
MICHAEL: It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas. 
ERIN: Welcome back, "Dad!" 
JIM: Oh, thank you! 
PHYLLIS: Hey! 
STANLEY: Hey! 
ANDY: Welcome back Tuna! 
JIM: Hey...  
DWIGHT: Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks. 
JIM: What do we got here? 
DWIGHT: Mega-Desk. 
JIM: Of course. 
DWIGHT: Command central. 
JIM: Hm hm. 
DWIGHT: Surveillance, gaming- and business. 
JIM: Okay.  Just gotta... 
DWIGHT: Okay. Come on! Jim! 
DWIGHT: Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk. 
JO: Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling! 
JIM: Morning! 
JO: Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something. 
JO: Oh good morning sweetheart. 
MICHAEL: Morning, honey-pile. 
JO: I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands? 
MICHAEL: It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by. 
JO:  Is that a lump of coal? 
MICHAEL: Yes it is! 
JO: Have I been that naughty? 
MICHAEL: No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal. 
JO: Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted. 
MICHAEL: Mm, that sounds great, actually. 
JO: Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay. 
MICHAEL: When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in! 
ANDY: Erin go braugh! 
ERIN: Andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt! 
ANDY: Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt. 
ANDY: Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to "How I Met Your Mother" that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them. 
JIM: No.  
DWIGHT: Great. 
JIM: No. 
DWIGHT: Thank you.  
JIM: No-no-no-no-no. 
DWIGHT: Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please? 
JIM:  Is this yours or mine? 
DWIGHT: They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy! 
JIM: Good Lord!  I can't believe I'm missing this. 
PAM: It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic. 
JIM: Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon.  
DWIGHT: Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life? 
JIM: It is. Big time. 
DWIGHT: Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now. 
JIM: Pretty amazing. 
DWIGHT: What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on. 
JIM: Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons. 
DWIGHT: I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father. 
JIM: Is that what happened to you? 
DWIGHT: I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother. 
JIM: That's a common mistake. 
DWIGHT: Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending. 
ANGELA: Hey!  Are you sick? 
ERIN: Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion. 
ANGELA: In your nose? 
ERIN: Yes.  
ERIN: I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six. 
JO: Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like. 
MICHAEL: That is a great idea JB. 
JO: Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist. 
KEVIN: Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap. 
JO: You know it doesn't have to be an invention. 
OSCAR: I have a question. 
MICHAEL: Oscar, homosexual accountant. 
OSCAR: In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee? 
JO: I am so proud of Sabre's "Print In All Colors" initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply.  Daryl? 
MICHAEL: Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse... 
JO: Okay hush now. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DARYL: The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in. 
JO: But you wouldn't need more trucks? 
DARYL: Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs. 
JO: Oh look at you. 
MICHAEL: Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen. 
JO:  I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here? 
DARYL: Are you serious? 
JO: Yeah. Take Jim's old office. 
GABE: Um. I set my stuff up in there. So... just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you. 
JO: Yeah, I want to hear more from you. 
DARYL: Absolutely. 
JO: All right. 
DARYL: Thank you. 
JO: Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while! 
MICHAEL: Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much! 
JO: Yes, well okay. Florida ain't that far away. 
MICHAEL: Well, I am heading down there. 
JO: Well, anytime now. 
MICHAEL: How about July 4th weekend?  
JO: Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket? 
MICHAEL: I did! 
JO: Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay? 
MICHAEL: You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and - 
JO: Enough! 
MICHAEL: All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on. 
MICHAEL: Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm. 
DARYL:  Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky... 
MICHAEL: Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch. 
JO: No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set. 
MICHAEL: No is not an option. 
JO: Yes it is. 
MICHAEL: All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no. 
JO: How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work? 
MICHAEL:  I'll be over there. 
JIM: And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now. 
DWIGHT:  Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you. 
JIM: What? 
DWIGHT: My headphones are broken. 
JIM: Right. 
DWIGHT: Can I listen to my music at a low volume? 
JIM: Yeah that's great. Great. 
DWIGHT: Okay?  "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-" 
JIM:  When's the last time you upgraded your printer? 
D: "- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don't know when-" 
JIM:  Please stop that! 
DWIGHT: "-But we'll be together then-" 
JIM: Can you grow up? 
DWIGHT: "-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then." 
JIM:  Whether it's this time or next time. 
ANDY:  "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon" 
JIM:  Yeah. Andy and 
DWIGHT:  "Little boy blue and the man in the moon." 
JIM: No, we definitely can talk about it in the next-- Andy and 
DWIGHT: "When you coming home Dad? 
JIM: You know, can I call you back? Andy and 
DWIGHT: "I don't know when-" 
JIM: That would be great, thank you. Andy and 
DWIGHT: "But we'll get together then, we're gonna have a good time-" 
JIM:  No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home. 
JIM: I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working. 
ERIN: This fax came for you.  
JO: Oh no no no! Are you feeling ill? 
ERIN: Uh... 
JO: Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can't have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week. 
ERIN: Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car. 
JO: Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay? 
ERIN: Well...  
ANDY: She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right? 
JO: Yes? 
ANDY: I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you.  
JO: Oh! You're sick!  Dangit! That's exactly why I sent that receptionist home. 
ANDY: No, no, no, no, no. 
JO: Get everybody sick in the office. 
ANDY: I have some good ideas... 
JO: We don't need any heroes here honey. It's time for you to get on home now. 
ANDY: You sure? 
JO: You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on. 
MICHAEL: Very nice. 
DARYL: Not bad, huh? 
MICHAEL: A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen? 
DARYL: I impressed her with my good ideas. 
MICHAEL: Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it? 
DARYL: I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there. 
MICHAEL: How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice? 
DARYL: Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television. 
MICHAEL: Okay. All right. 
JO: Hey there. 
MICHAEL: Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier. 
JO: Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time. 
MICHAEL: Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so. 
JO: Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work... 
MICHAEL: Right. What? 
JO: Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home. 
MICHAEL: Mm. mm. Oh well. 
JO: Anything else I can help you with? 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish.  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. 
KEVIN: Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous. 
MICHAEL: Hey Pack-man. Todd 
PACKER: Hey what's up, Butt-plug? 
MICHAEL: How you doing stud? You already there? Todd 
PACKER: Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice. 
MICHAEL: How's the lady situation? Todd 
PACKER: Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance. 
MICHAEL: Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late. Todd 
PACKER: Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me! 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Maybe next year. Todd 
PACKER: Maybe next "queer." Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash? 
ERIN:  Oh! Andy! 
ANDY: Hi! 
ERIN: I'm in my jammy-jams! 
ANDY: That's okay, I'm in my "worky-works." You look amazing! 
ERIN: Oh, thanks. Come in! 
MEREDITH: Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in? 
KEVIN: Oh I'm in. 
OSCAR: I'm in. 
MEREDITH: All right.  
JO: Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off.  You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both! 
DWIGHT: Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence.  No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.  
DWIGHT: Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening  I have... 
JO: Hello? 
JIM: Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay. 
JO: Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers. 
JIM: You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this! 
JO: Okay. 
JIM: Okay. 
JO: Sorry Sugar. What'd you want? 
DWIGHT: Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week. 
JO: Thank you. 
JIM:  Thanks again by the way. 
DARYL: Hey! What are you fellas doing up here? Warehouse guy 
1: We're here to bust you out! 
DARYL: I wish, but uh- Warehouse guy 
1: Dude! Your shirt tucked in? 
DARYL: Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom. All right then, uh, let me get to it. Warehouse guy 
1: All right. Warehouse guy 
2: See you later. 
ERIN: Your hand's cold. 
ANDY: It is? I'm sorry. 
ERIN: Yeah, have some more blanket. 
ANDY: Okay, thanks. 
REID: What's up? 
ANDY: Whoa! 
ERIN: You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid. 
ANDY: I didn't know you had a brother. 
ERIN: He's my foster brother. 
ANDY: Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard.  
REID: Cold hands.  
ANDY: Are we rotating seats, or? 
REID: Oh yeah, you're the guest. Take the easy chair, best seat in the house. Plus, you don't have to sit next to this big dork and her smelly feet. 
ERIN: Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them!  
REID: Ooh!  
ANDY: So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-? 
ERIN: None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen. 
ANDY: All right. Formative years.  
REID: Nice skirt. 
ANDY: Yeah, it's a kilt. Night cleaning 
CREW: Oh! Sorry! Sorry, sorry.  
ANGELA: Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day. 
JO: Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carrying nothing but my Sable gloves. I've had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry. 
MICHAEL: How late do we have to work tonight? 
GABE: You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days. 
MICHAEL: Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is? 
GABE: Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right? I will date when I'm dead!  
MICHAEL: Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing. 
MICHAEL: Hello Jo. 
JO: Anything I can do for you Puddin'? 
MICHAEL: There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees. 
JO: Hmm. 
MICHAEL: I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around. 
JO: All right then. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day.  And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship. 
JO: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
JO: I look forward to that too. 
ANDY: Ooh. It's coming down out there. 
ERIN: Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here. 
ANDY: No, I- 
ERIN: I'm so sorry I was so sick.  
ANDY: Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick.  
MICHAEL: Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys! Meredith, Creed, Oscar and 
MATT:  
MICHAEL: Drinks are on me! 
OSCAR: No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us! 
MICHAEL: Oh -hoh! All right. 
MICHAEL: Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself 
SOMETHING: Do I even like her? As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, "Don't worry, be happy." Todd 
PACKER: Whoops!  
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever.  What the hell is going on back there? 
JIM: Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem.  Thank you. 
DWIGHT: What the hell is this? 
JIM: Oh! 
DWIGHT: This is not Mega-Desk. 
JIM: No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk. 
DWIGHT: That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks. 
JIM: Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we?  
DWIGHT: Hello, Dwight Schrute? 
MICHAEL: Hey Jim, Jim. Come here.  Do you know who that is? 
JIM: No. 
MICHAEL: Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans... 
JIM: Is he you? 
MICHAEL:  I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp. 
JIM: Where did you take that? 
MICHAEL: In my condo complex. 
JIM: Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton. 
MICHAEL: I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie. 
JIM: Sure. That they should do one. 
MICHAEL:  Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl? 
JIM: Who's that? 
MICHAEL: Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim. 
JIM: John Dillinger. 
MICHAEL: No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. 
JIM: Captain Crunch. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens? 
JIM: At the Yankees game. Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Well, it wasn't him. 
JIM: I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp... 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. 
JIM: ...in your condo complex. 
MICHAEL: I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman. 
JIM: M. Night Shulman? 
MICHAEL:  First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like - 
STANLEY: When are we getting to sales topics? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate? 
MICHAEL: Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be..  No, no, meeting's not over. 
PHYLLIS: But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here? 
MICHAEL: No sales topic per se. 
ANDY: Well then no Andy Bernard per se.  
MICHAEL: Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make. 
MICHAEL: I would like your undivided attention, please. 
DWIGHT: You couldn't handle my undivided attention. 
MICHAEL: Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work 
WAS: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order. 
DWIGHT: Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: When I was asking about the leads. 
MICHAEL: M-hmm. 
DWIGHT: ... is there any news on the leads? 
MICHAEL: Is that all you have to say to me? 
DWIGHT: Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone!  Alright, Dwight out! 
DWIGHT: Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself? 
ANGELA: Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk. 
PHYLLIS: Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk. 
MICHAEL: Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque.  
JIM: Oh, sorry, wait one second. 
MICHAEL: Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you. 
JIM: This is actually a big potential sale, so... 
MICHAEL: You writing your memoirs over there? 
JIM: You writing your name over there? 
MICHAEL: Well, it's a pretty big check. 
JIM: That's good. You know, with the kid. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people. 
JIM: Alright, here we go.  Michael... 
MICHAEL: I'm just saying, that - 
JIM: Michael -  Great. 
ANDY:  Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick.  Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy...  I'm making a sale. Sales. 
DARRYL: There's other pencil's in this office. 
ANDY: Give me that  
MICHAEL: Honey and jelly sandwich time.  
DARRYL: Michael. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you got to be kidding me.  Look at that. That's - 
DARRYL: I know who did that. 
MICHAEL: You saw who did this and you didn't stop them? 
DARRYL: Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control. 
MICHAEL: The sales department smashed my sandwich. 
DARRYL: Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them. 
MICHAEL: You don't get it. 
DARRYL: You need to get back on top. 
MICHAEL: That's what she said. 
DARRYL: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
ERIN: Something came for you, Michael.  
MICHAEL: Thank you very much. 
JIM: What'd you get? 
MICHAEL: Ah, just the stupid leads. 
JIM: Alright! 
STANLEY: About time. 
ANDY: Me likey! 
PHYLLIS: Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts.  But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you.  
STANLEY: We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael! 
GABE:  Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out. 
MICHAEL: Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone. 
GABE: Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff - 
MICHAEL: They act like I have no power. 
GABE: But you do. You are in charge - 
MIICHAEL: Thank you. 
GABE: - of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that. 
GABE: Okay, good. 
MICHAEL: Exactly that. 
GABE: Good. 
MICHAEL: Exactly that. 
GABE: Why do you keep repeating -  
MICHAEL: Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed!  
PHYLLIS: What are you - 
MICHAEL: - and to King Meredith!  
STANLEY: They aren't salespeople! 
MICHAEL: And to King Angela!  Because today we are all kings. And queens . 
PHYLLIS: What the hell do you think you're doing? 
MICHAEL: I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis. 
JIM: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
JIM: So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right? 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls? 
MICHAEL: Okay.  
JIM: Hey, alright. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
JIM: Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they? 
MICHAEL: Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic? 
JIM: I don't think you understand - 
MICHAEL: I do understand it. 
JIM:  This one's a map. 
MICHAEL: Or is it? 
ANGELA: Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail. 
PHYLLIS: Are you gonna give me the leads or not? 
ANGELA: I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work  
PHYLLIS: What are these for? 
ANGELA: It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them. 
KELLY: I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring - 
RYAN: It's my - 
STANLEY: The Kardashians is a good show. 
RYAN: No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians? 
KELLY: It's about a family. A real-life family. 
RYAN: No, Stanley, do you - 
PAM:  Hey baby, what's up? 
JIM: I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you? 
PAM: Nothing but vomit and diapers over here. 
JIM: Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more. 
JIM: Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies  - that's just unfair. 
JIM: How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.' 
PAM: He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca. 
JIM: I love you. 
MICHAEL: Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment.  A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally  Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  Some people shouldn't be in this business. 
ANDY: Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman. 
ERIN: Yeah. I basically wish you were dead.  I hid the leads. 
ANDY: Where? 
ERIN:  Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot.  Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower. 
ANDY: Are you... 
ERIN: Lower. 
ANDY: Are you sure? 
ERIN: Lower  
DWIGHT: What are you doing, idiot?  
JIM: Michael's stupid scavenger hunt. 
DWIGHT: Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it.  'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.' 
JIM:  Lincoln. 
DWIGHT: The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha. 
JIM:  It involves you too. 
DWIGHT: The leads are in? 
DWIGHT: Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in. 
MICHAEL: Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'. 
DWIGHT: Kevin! Damnit  Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon - 
KEVIN: You are never going to find them. 
DWIGHT: Really. 
KEVIN: I'm going to enjoy this. 
DWIGHT:  Gimme the leads. Where are my leads? 
KEVIN:  I'm still enjoying it. 
DWIGHT: Where are they? 
KEVIN: Turn the trash. Turn the trash. 
DWIGHT: Turn the trash  It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress. 
MEREDITH:  Okey-dokey. 
KEVIN: No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen. 
MEREDITH: It's coming off anyway. 
DWIGHT:  Clean sack. 
KEVIN: What - 
ERIN: I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush. 
TOBY: If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads. 
DWIGHT:  It's empty! 
MICHAEL: Wait. What day is today? 
KEVIN: Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday. 
MICHAEL: Oh my god. Oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait! 
MICHAEL: Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car - 
PHYLLIS: Michael, why would we all go to the dump? 
MICHAEL: Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump." 
STANLEY: Not your staff, Michael. You. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you - 
TOBY: Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel? 
MICHAEL: Really? 
ANGELA: I'm not going. You did this, not us. 
MICHAEL: Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit  Complicit. You were all successories! 
DARRYL: That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go. 
MICHAEL: You can. 
DARRYL: I can't. You know that. 
MICHAEL: Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself. 
DWIGHT: I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up. 
DWIGHT:  This place has gone to hell. 
MICHAEL: You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters. 
KELLY:  You're adorable. You need to go for it.  I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't - 
JIM: Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over. 
KELLY: Why? 
JIM: Just all the - drama. 
KELLY: What drama? 
JIM: Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right? 
KELLY: So unnecessary. 
JIM: Oh, good, phew, thank god you said that. 
KELLY: I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that? 
JIM: I have new baby pictures. 
KELLY: Don't use your cute baby to make us like you. 
JIM: She's wearing a onesie  
STANLEY: If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly. 
JIM: Didn't we kind of start it? 
PHYLLIS: I think you're remembering that wrong? 
ANDY: Yeah. 
PHYLLIS: I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India. 
JIM: Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad? 
ANDY: All those who agree, say aye  All those opposed - 
JIM: I don't think we need opposed. 
MICHAEL:  You've changed, man. 
DWIGHT: Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission? 
MICHAEL: Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent. 
DWIGHT: Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him - 
MICHAEL: Assistant to the managed him - 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot! 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere. 
MICHAEL: You think you would have done better without me? Really? 
DWIGHT: I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you - 
DWIGHT: Kung-fu movies! 
MICHAEL: You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies - 
DWIGHT: Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars. 
MICHAEL: That's my wife you're talking about, man. 
DWIGHT: Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist?  You watch it! 
MICHAEL: If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you. 
DWIGHT: Don't do it  
MICHAEL: No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight.  No, time out, time out.  Time in! 
DWIGHT: No!  
MICHAEL: Don't even think about that  
DWIGHT:  Stop it, get out! That's my spool. 
PHYLLIS: What's the least we can do to make this okay? 
JIM: I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff. 
ANDY: And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too. 
PHYLLIS: I guess we could give them some of our new commissions. 
STANLEY: That is a dangerous precedent. 
JIM: Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one. 
JIM: Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it. 
PHYLLIS: Okay, fine. Cash it is. 
ANDY: Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches". 
MICHAEL: Okay, Dwight. Here we go  oh god. 
DWIGHT: Oh  
MICHAEL: We're never going to find those leads, are we?  
DWIGHT:  Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this. 
PHYLLIS: So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you - 
JIM: No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay  Hey everybody! 
MEREDITH:  Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty. 
JIM: No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel 
IS: really sorry. 
ANDY: Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  
OSCAR: Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move. 
KEVIN: Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell. 
ANGELA: Do you have any pastries without fruit? 
JIM: Yes! We do.  Eclairs. 
STANLEY:  Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our - 
JIM: - two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee. 
PHYLLIS: Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more. 
STANLEY:  This is - nice!  All of us back together. 
MICHAEL: This  Why would somebody throw that out? 
DWIGHT: Hey  You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, she does - she loves purple.  Does it stink? 
DWIGHT: Yeah  
MICHAEL: Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would 
READ: 
DWIGHT: Hope - grows. 
MICHAEL: In the dump. 
DWIGHT:  Woo hoo! 
STANLEY: Good news that you found our leads? 
MICHAEL: No! Better! 
DWIGHT: We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room.  
PHYLLIS: Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only  
ANDY:  It's freezing out here. 
ERIN:  Go on. I have warm blood.  
ANDY: Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met.  
DWIGHT:  Breathe. Work your core. Come on. 
MICHAEL: How many is that? 
DWIGHT: Not counting the last one, 25. 
MICHAEL: Count the last one. 
DWIGHT: Ok, 25 and one girl push-up! 
MICHAEL: Oh, new record! 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, what did you do today? 
JIM: I made a sale. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat. 
MEREDITH: What do we get if we do 'em? 
MICHAEL: My respect.  Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups - 
DWIGHT: And one girl push-up. 
MICHAEL: Gets to go home.  Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high.  Disqualified! 
ANGELA: Ow! 
MICHAEL: What do we got? Creed, disqualified. 
CREED:  Oh, come on! 
JIM: 19.  I had a really hard work out this morning. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, wow, that is adorable! 
PHYLLIS: Ten... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm betting one more. 
PHYLLIS: Eleven, wow! 
MICHAEL: Good. 
EVERYONE:  Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley... 
MICHAEL: Alright, alright.  
OSCAR: Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby. 
MICHAEL: Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down. 
DWIGHT: 25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it! 
PHYLLIS: One more, one more!  
OSCAR: You okay? You okay, Stanley? 
STANLEY: Excuse me. 
JIM: Wow.  
OSCAR: Hey. Matt, right? 
MATT: Hey, Oscar. You're here early. 
OSCAR: I always come in at 7. Warehouse 
GUY: No, you don't. 
OSCAR: Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight? 
MATT: I don't know. I'm free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know. 
OSCAR: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there.  Just a couple of hours to kill before work. 
DARRYL: Hey, what's up? 
OSCAR: Hey, nice office. 
DARRYL: Thanks, it's cool. So... 
OSCAR: You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink. 
DARRYL: Has that ever happened? Ever? 
OSCAR: Didn't we? I think we did. 
DARRYL: You want me to invite Matt? 
OSCAR: Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included. 
DARRYL: Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me. 
OSCAR: So happy hour. 
DARRYL: Happy hour. My pleasure. 
OSCAR: All right. 
OSCAR: So what do you think? 
PHYLLIS: Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What? 
ANDY: A bunch of us are talking about happy hour. 
JIM: I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in. 
ANDY: Oh, baloney. 
JIM: Good one. 
ANDY: Ring her up. 
JIM: Absolutely, I will do that right now. 
JIM: I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much. 
JIM: So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them- 
PAM:  Yes! Yes! I would love to! 
ANDY: Ha! Knew it! 
PAM:  It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God! 
JIM: I did not see this coming. 
ANDY: Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto.  Are you going later? 
ERIN: Sure, if you are. 
ANDY: Yes. 
ERIN: Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off. 
ANDY: Whoa. 
ANDY: We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um... but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama. 
ERIN: Exactly. 
ANDY: Yeah, cause when everyone knows-  That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know. 
ERIN: Quiet. 
ANDY: Hey, boss man. 
MICHAEL: Yes? 
ANDY: A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in? 
MICHAEL: Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time. 
ANDY: I'm sorry, I meant later. 
MICHAEL: Ok, yes. Sure. 
ANDY: For happy hour? 
MICHAEL: No, I got that. 
ANDY: Trying to get a head count. 
MICHAEL: I am in. 
ANDY: All right, yes! It's a deal. 
MICHAEL: It's a deal. 
PAM: Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie. 
JIM: Okay. 
PAM: I want her to meet Michael. 
JIM: Why? 
PAM: They're both single, I have a sense they might- 
JIM: You've been gone for a long time. 
PAM: It is not that. Kevin! Oh! 
KEVIN: Yeah!  
PAM: Hey, how are you? 
KEVIN: Oh, I missed you so much. 
PAM: Aw! 
KEVIN: Yeah! 
PAM: Yeah! 
KEVIN: Waaah!  
KEVIN: When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny. 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God!  
JIM: Easy. 
MICHAEL: It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party... 
JIM: Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth. 
MICHAEL: Sucks to be you. 
JIM: Would you like to be our fourth? 
MICHAEL: That would be sublime. 
JIM: All right. 
DARRYL: So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.'  It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs. 
PAM: Hey, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
PAM: This is my friend Julie. 
MICHAEL: Hello, how are you? 
JULIE: Good. Hi. 
MICHAEL: What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for?  
PAM: Julie laughs at everything. 
JULIE: So you work with Pam and Jim? 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired. 
JULIE:  I should hope not. 
MICHAEL: No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win. 
ISABEL: Hey. 
PAM: Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness. 
ISABEL: Of course. 
PAM: You want to play pool? 
ISABEL: Um, I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone. 
PAM: Ok. 
ANGELA: And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that- 
DWIGHT: Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel. 
ISABEL: Mm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: What's a girl like you doing in a place like this? 
ISABEL: A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this. 
DWIGHT: Ooh, I love repartee. 
ISABEL: Do you? 
DWIGHT: Usually means there's a battle scene coming. 
MICHAEL: So, what do you do? 
JULIE: I am an ESL teacher. 
MICHAEL: Really? 
JULIE: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now? 
JULIE: Are you thinking that I said 'ESP?' 
MICHAEL: Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome. 
JULIE: I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done. 
JIM: So what do you think? 
MICHAEL: About what? 
JIM: About Julie? 
MICHAEL: She's nice. 
JIM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
JIM: So you like her? 
MICHAEL: Uh, yeah, sure. 
JIM: So Pam was right? 
MICHAEL: About what? 
JIM: About you two hitting it off. 
MICHAEL:  Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything.  
HIDE: My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart. 
OSCAR: I know. 
PAM: Hey, Michael, where have you been?  
JIM: Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok? 
PAM: Why are you wearing a hat now? 
MICHAEL: Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang. 
MICHAEL: Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning?  
JIM: You want to just make a run for it? 
PAM: Maybe. 
KEVIN: Waaaah!  Waaaaah! Mommy! 
JIM: What is happening? 
ANDY: Whoa! What is crackin? 
RYAN: Guys, one second.  
KELLY: We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk. 
ERIN: What's this game? 
RYAN: One second. 
ANDY: Yeah, how do you play? 
RYAN: Guys, guys, guys, please.  Ok, all right, it's all yours now. 
KELLY: Only three tickets. 
RYAN: If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time. 
KELLY: Stop telling me how to spend my tickets. 
RYAN: I know, but you wanted the big thing. 
ANDY: Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together? 
ERIN: Oh I know. 
ANDY: They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?' 
ERIN: 'Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.' 
ANDY: 'Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch. 
ERIN: Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart. 
ANDY: No drama. Ok. 
ISABEL: Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole. 
DWIGHT: Any brothers or sisters? 
ISABEL: Three brothers. 
DWIGHT: Really? 
ISABEL: Two are in the Marines, one's a cop. 
DWIGHT: Vegetarian? 
ISABEL: No. I love meat. 
DWIGHT: What's your blood type? 
ISABEL: O-negative. Universal donor. 
DWIGHT: Universal donor.  
DWIGHT: Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela. 
MICHAEL: Hey, guys, guys, guys.  Watch this. Ready? 
JULIE: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue. 
JIM: Michael, you don't have to do this. 
MICHAEL:  Wow. Oh, wow, that was close. 
MICHAEL: I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, you two having fun? 
ANDY: Did you tell them? 
ERIN: No. 
ANDY: This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama! 
ERIN: I get it. 
ISABEL:  You are amazing at this. How did you get so good? 
DWIGHT: Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me. 
ISABEL: Whack! 
DWIGHT: Extend the fingers more. 
ISABEL: Whack! 
DWIGHT: Good. 
ANGELA: This looks like a hoot. 
DWIGHT: Hey, monkey, how you doing? 
ANGELA: Whack. 
DWIGHT: Listen, can I talk to you for a second? 
ANGELA: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore. 
ANGELA: It's no worry. 
DWIGHT: It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family. 
ANGELA: I could see enjoying that. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook. 
ANGELA: But we signed the contract. 
DWIGHT: Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later. 
ANGELA: We both-you didn't dup- 
JIM:  Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this. 
PAM: Maybe it should come from a man. 
JIM: Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow. Bar 
MANAGER: Hello. 
MICHAEL: Hello. Bar 
MANAGER: Hi. 
MICHAEL: Hi. Bar 
MANAGER: You wanna pay 400 bucks to re-felt this table? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania? 
PAM: Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down. 
MICHAEL: Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun. Bar 
MANAGER: Ted, are we having fun? 
MICHAEL: Really? You told on me. That's lame. 
BOUNCER: We got a problem? 
MICHAEL: Yes. Homelessness. What? Bar 
MANAGER: All right, go. 
MICHAEL: Where? Bar 
MANAGER: Get out. Now. 
MICHAEL: Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry. 
PAM: Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot. 
MICHAEL: She can't talk to us that way. 
PAM: You guys are stripes, I think... 
MICHAEL: You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop? 
JIM: It stopped. 
MICHAEL: Well, I am starting it again! 
PAM: Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here. 
MICHAEL: Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize. Bar 
MANAGER: Then I am sorry that I didn't kick you out. 
MICHAEL: I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello. Bar 
MANAGER: Well, uh, I'm the manager here, sir. 
MICHAEL: Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you. Bar 
MANAGER: Is that how you do it? 
MICHAEL: Yes it is. I am writing a book about it. Bar 
MANAGER: Really? How much have you written? 
MICHAEL: I've written all of it... in my head. Bar 
MANAGER: Oh. 
MICHAEL: If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up. Bar 
MANAGER: Huh. Have you read Lee Iacocca's? It's a classic. 
MICHAEL: Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it. Bar 
MANAGER: Dude, tonight! You're not going to want to put it down. It's gonna make you want to go out and buy a Chrysler tomorrow. 
MICHAEL: I own a Chrysler. Bar 
MANAGER: Shut up. 
MICHAEL: No, you shut up. Bar 
MANAGER: What's your drink? 
MICHAEL: Grenadine. Bar 
MANAGER: What? 
ANDY: We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead. 
ERIN: Okay. 
ANDY:  Hi. Girl at 
TABLE: Hi. 
ANDY: I don't normally do this, but... Girl at 
TABLE: Do what? 
ANDY: Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people. 
ERIN:  Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that? 
ANDY:  What are you doing? 
ERIN: What we said to do. 
ANDY: We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers! 
ERIN: I was flirting with a man. 
ANDY: Get in here.  Where did you learn to talk like that? 
ERIN: The movies. I don't know. 
ANDY: Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan? 
MICHAEL: I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre. Bar 
MANAGER: You have a card? 
MICHAEL: I did. I actually put it in your bowl. Bar 
MANAGER: Stanley Hudson? 
MICHAEL: No, no. Bar 
MANAGER: Whoa, a lot of Stanley Hudson's in here. 
MICHAEL: No, it's Michael Scott. Bar 
MANAGER: Michael Scott? 
MICHAEL: He is I. Bar 
MANAGER: You just won yourself a lunch. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey guys.  
JULIE: I think I'm gonna go. 
PAM: Really? 
JULIE: Yeah. 
PAM: I'm sorry, he's not usually like that. 
JULIE: What's he usually like? 
PAM: He's more, just... like... you can go. 
JULIE: Yeah. 
JIM: All right. 
PAM: Okay. Bye. 
JIM: See ya. Nice girl. 
PAM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Hey, Julie! You having fun?  Bar 
MANAGER: So... when are you coming in for that free lunch? You're gonna want to come in on a day that I'm working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too. 
DARRYL: Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right? 
OSCAR: I couldn't understand a word he said. 
DARRYL: Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common. 
OSCAR: Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky. 
MATT: Hey, what's up? 
OSCAR: There he is! Hey, hey, hey. 
MATT: Anyone up for some hoops? 
OSCAR: Sure. Hoops! 
MATT: Let's do it. 
OSCAR: Hoop it up, right. 
ANDY: This is not what I want my relationship to look like.  
ANDY:  Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you. 
ANDY: You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go. 
ERIN:  You love drama. 
ANDY: I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen. 
DWIGHT: With this move, he can't get you. 
ISABEL: Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler. 
DWIGHT: Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah! 
ANGELA: Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute. 
DWIGHT: Sh-what? 
ANGELA: You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no.  Blah blah blah blah! 
ANGELA: For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin. 
ISABEL: What are you talking about? 
DWIGHT: What are you- 
ANGELA: Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me. 
DWIGHT: Angela... 
ANGELA: Did he not tell you that? 
DWIGHT: You're really putting me in an awkward position here. 
ANGELA: Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract? 
DWIGHT: Angela, not here! 
ANGELA: Dwight? 
ISABEL: Whack!  
ANGELA: You'll see me in small claims court! 
DWIGHT: You are an impressive specimen. 
ISABEL: Thank you.  
KELLY:  Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill. 
PAM: Oh-oh, gosh. Oh. 
JIM: You all right? 
PAM: Okay, we have to get home. 
KEVIN: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady. 
JIM: Actually, you didn't. 
PAM: Not at all. 
MICHAEL: I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me. 
DARRYL: Tell 'em your story, Hide. 
HIDE: In Japan, heart surgeon. Number one. Steady hand. One day, yakuza boss need new heart. I do operation. But, mistake! Yakuza boss die. Yakuza very mad. I hide in fishing boat, come to America. No English, no food, no money. Darryl give me job. Now I have house, American car, and new woman. Darryl save life. My big 
SECRET: I kill yakuza boss on purpose. I good surgeon. The best!  Cookie 
MONSTER:  Oscar, Toby said he left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair. Have you seen them? Wait I'm sitting on them.  
ANDY: This is awesome! 
OSCAR: Thank you. It didn't even take that long. Cookie 
MONSTER:  What's the difference between a chimichanga,  a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back ASAP. It's urgent. 
KEVIN: This isn't funny. I don't talk like that.  
PHYLLIS: Say "Me eat cookie." 
KEVIN: No. I won't say it. 
DWIGHT: Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique. 
RYAN: It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street. 
DWIGHT:  Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio? 
PHYLLIS: Mm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: I love that show. Cookie 
MONSTER:  This is Kevin. This is Kevin. 
RYAN: Good work, buddy. 
OSCAR: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please. 
OSCAR: Yes. 
KELLY: Me, too Oscar. 
RYAN: C.C. me 
KEVIN: Angela, this is inappropriate. 
ANGELA: This is my favorite day. 
ANDY: It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. . Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago. And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin. 
MEREDITH: Here you go. 
ERIN: Oh, thank you. 
ANDY: I do. 
DWIGHT:  
ERIN: Thank you. 
ANDY: If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom. 
ERIN:  Welcome back! 
PAM: Hey, thanks. 
PAM: It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off. 
PAM:  Oh. You couldn't have watered it? 
JIM: I literally did not know that existed until this moment. 
DWIGHT: Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die. 
PAM: It's nice to see you again, Dwight. 
DWIGHT.: Hello, Pam. 
ANDY:  I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day. 
MICHAEL: I'm going to give Erin $15. 
ERIN: I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch. 
MICHAEL: A one-on-one lunch with Erin? 
ANDY: Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. . 
MICHAEL: She's kind of a rube. 
ANDY:  That's my girlfriend you're talking about. 
MICHAEL: Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch. 
ANDY:  She's gonna be so psyched. 
MICHAEL:  Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day. 
ERIN: Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss. 
MICHAEL: I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch. 
ERIN: I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's. 
MICHAEL: Ugh. 
ERIN: Just the two of us. 
MICHAEL: Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm... 
ERIN: Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but... 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, we'll figure something.  
ERIN: Oh. 
MICHAEL:  Okay, let's go to Hayworth's. 
ERIN:  Okay. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
MEREDITH:  Have a cookie, Kev. 
KEVIN: Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that. 
DARRYL: I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there. 
KEVIN: Man, Darryl, I'm sorry.  Happy Birthday. 
DARRYL: Thank you.  
DARRYL:  Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum. 
KEVIN: They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me. 
KEVIN:  Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level... 
GABE: This is violent and offensive. 
KEVIN: Thank you.  It really makes me self-conscious about my voice. 
GABE: It's awful.  
KEVIN: I'm not crying. 
GABE: You have some food on your face. 
KEVIN:  Do my hands feel sweaty to you?  
GABE: The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure. 
GABE: Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around. 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
GABE: And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao. 
MICHAEL:  Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire. 
ERIN: I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager? 
MICHAEL:  I don't know. 
ERIN: I would have chosen the 1490's. 
MICHAEL: Ahhh. 
ERIN: 'Cause America was discovered. 
MICHAEL: Right.  
ERIN:  And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. . So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month? 
MICHAEL: An age or month? 
ERIN: Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven. 
MICHAEL: I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird. 
ERIN: How many pillows do you sleep on at night? 
MICHAEL: So how are things going with Andy? 
ERIN: He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him. 
MICHAEL: Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo. 
ERIN: Yeah I love that. 
MICHAEL: Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser. 
ERIN: What? 
MICHAEL: I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter. 
ERIN: Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela? 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh. Hayworth's 
WAITER: Here we go. Hot plate. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Hayworth's 
WAITER: And your salad, miss. 
ERIN: Why wouldn't he tell me that? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else. 
ERIN: They had sex? 
MICHAEL: They were engaged, so...  Okay, you know what, sir? Hayworth's 
WAITER: Yes? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles? Hayworth's 
WAITER: Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
ERIN: Uhhhh, they were engaged? 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
ERIN:  Uh-oh... 
MICHAEL: Well... 
ERIN:  
MICHAEL: What are you doing? What are you doing? 
ERIN: In the Foster home, my hair was my room.  
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now. 
ERIN:  
MICHAEL:  I'll have what she's having! 
MICHAEL:  Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch. 
PAM:  Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha. 
JIM: What's up? 
DWIGHT: Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable. 
JIM: Dwight, don't be gross. 
PAM: No, no, he's right. 
DWIGHT: Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy. 
PAM: That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump? 
DWIGHT:  All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me. 
PAM: You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay? 
DWIGHT: Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you. 
PAM: Mm.  Meredith! 
MEREDITH: I just like the way it feels. 
PAM: What are you doing?! 
MEREDITH: Just relax. Okay. 
PAM: Relax?! 
MEREDITH: This is like the Cadillac of pumps. 
PAM: Give it back to me now. 
MEREDITH: Okay, I was just warming it up. 
PAM: It's disgusting! 
MEREDITH: It's not a big deal. 
PAM: It's not sterile! 
MEREDITH: We're both girls. Who cares? 
ANDY: So... how was lunch? 
ERIN: Lunch was fine. 
ANDY: Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be? 
ERIN: I don't know. It was lunch, Andy. 
ANDY: Well, I know.  Just want... I mean...  
OSCAR: Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets. 
ERIN: God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy. 
KELLY:  "My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant." See I did the voice. 
RYAN: That's a little derivative. 
KELLY: But parody is always derivative. 
RYAN: Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean? 
PAM: Jim does a really good one. Do yours. 
JIM: Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall." 
GABE: Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV? 
JIM: "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies." 
GABE: Ok. 
ANDY: Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so.. 
ANDY: I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic. 
MICHAEL: No. No. No. 
ANDY: Specific shout-out.. 
MICHAEL: Stop talking. 
ANDY: Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote  a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three.. 
ERIN:  I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me. 
MICHAEL: Oh God. 
ANDY: Can we talk about this in private? 
ERIN: I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not? 
ANDY: Yes. 
ERIN: Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together? 
PAM: No, no never. 
ERIN: Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know? 
DWIGHT: Yeah pretty much. 
ERIN: Who are you?! I don't know you!  
GABE: I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue. 
KEVIN: Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you. 
ERIN: Thanks. 
KEVIN: So if you need anything, I'm right over there. 
PAM:  "Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful." 
GABE: Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days. 
PAM: What? What do you mean, suspend me? 
JIM: I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work. 
GABE: Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim.  Ok fine. You too Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making. 
GABE: I don't want to hear it. Suspended. 
KEVIN: "C" is for suspension. 
ANDY: Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day? 
MICHAEL: Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap. 
ANDY: I was going to tell her, just on my own time. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret. 
ANDY: Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things. 
ANGELA: Psst. Hey. Erin. 
ERIN: You want to talk to me, come to my desk. 
ANGELA: You embarrassed me earlier. 
ERIN: Oh. Take it up with the chief of police. 
ANGELA: You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it. 
ERIN: I want to throw up just thinking about it. 
ANGELA: You are throwing up for the wrong reasons! 
TOBY:  I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know. 
PAM: Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim. 
ERIN: Really? 
PAM: Yeah. And he worked here too. 
ERIN: It was Andy, wasn't it? 
PAM: No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants. 
ERIN: I hope you find what you're looking for. 
PAM: Thank you.  
GABE:  So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough. 
PAM:  Hey Toby. 
TOBY: I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal. 
PAM: Very interesting. 
TOBY: Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure... 
PAM:  Thanks Toby. 
GABE: Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important.  It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension. 
PAM: I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension. 
JIM: And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that. 
DWIGHT:  Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done.  Gabriel, I apologize. 
GABE: Great. 
DWIGHT:  I kneel before you. 
GABE: Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology. 
DWIGHT: Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition. 
GABE:  Guys, to err is human.  
ERIN: Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein? 
ANDY: Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill. 
ERIN: How long were you guys together? 
ANDY: A year. 
ERIN: A year? You were together for a year? 
ANDY: Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else... 
ERIN: I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok? 
ANDY: I didn't see that movie. 
GABE:  That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that. 
KELLY: Do they still get paid? 
GABE: It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened. 
OSCAR: Sounds like they just got to go home with pay. 
MEREDITH: Pathetic. 
GABE: Can I buy everyone coffees?   "Or cookies." 
DWIGHT: What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression? 
GABE: Alright. 
KEVIN:  Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person. 
GABE: You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang. 
DWIGHT: "I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit." 
KEVIN: "Ciao" Right? "Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee." 
GABE: Why don't we say ciao to the impressions?  
ERIN:  
MICHAEL: Erin? 
ERIN: Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone. 
MICHAEL: No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down? 
ERIN: I can't trust Andy anymore. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing. 
ERIN: It's Andy's fault. 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis. 
ERIN: Oh, I like his butt. 
MICHAEL: You said butt. 
ERIN: You tricked me! 
MICHAEL: Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is 
HIM: "Hey! Hey Scott!" 
ANDY: Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day. Oscar's voice from the 
COMPUTER: Hey Kevin it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping cost. 
KEVIN: I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome. 
PHYLLIS: I don't get it. 
JIM: Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice. 
PAM: Yeah. "I vant to count to ten". 
KEVIN: But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers. 
KELLY: But you're an accountant too. 
OSCAR: Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch? 
PAM: That would have been funny. 
KEVIN: But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? "Oscar. I am the Count." Nailed him. Nailed him.  Good work Cookie Monster. 
KEVIN: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Buenos dias, Erin. 
ERIN: Buenos dias, Miguel.  Hello, Dunder-Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor. 
MICHAEL: I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun. 
MICHAEL: Buenos dias, Jaime. 
JIM: Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa? 
MICHAEL: Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight! 
DWIGHT: Guten tag, Herr Michael. 
DWIGHT: I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid. 
MICHAEL: La telefona. 
OSCAR: El telefono. 
OSCAR: Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um...  I should have been more specific. 
OSCAR: Your office is full of genitalia. 
MICHAEL:  Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el! 
OSCAR: "That's what he says?" 
MICHAEL: Damn it.  Ah, Angelo. 
ANGELA: Angela.  Michael. 
MICHAEL: Yo soy Cancun. 
ANGELA:  Uhh! 
JIM: All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee. 
PAM: You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like,  "I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee." 
JIM: Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that. 
MICHAEL: Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple. 
DWIGHT: You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs. 
MICHAEL: I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company. 
DWIGHT: If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives? 
JIM:  That's a good point. 
PAM: This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together. 
JIM: Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other. 
PAM: We have good give and take.  I give, he takes. 
JIM:  I don't even know who you are anymore. 
PAM:  Yee. 
DONNA: Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott. 
JIM: Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim. 
DONNA: Hi! 
JIM: How are you? 
MICHAEL: Did somebody order a hooker over here? 
DONNA:  Oh, stop that. 
MICHAEL: Hi. How are you? 
MICHAEL: There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so... 
MICHAEL: Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today. 
DONNA: You look exactly alike. 
PAM: Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister. 
DONNA: I have a sense about these things. 
JIM: All right. 
DONNA: You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back. 
ANGELA: I knew it. You should see their baby. 
JIM:  So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate  So it's a tradeoff. 
MICHAEL:  Hi. 
JIM: Hold on one second. 
MICHAEL: Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret? 
JIM: What? 
MICHAEL: Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me. 
JIM: None of this is time sensitive. 
MICHAEL: Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May. 
DONNA: Oh, yeah, thank you. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I have more of them. 
GABE: You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities. 
DARRYL: Sounds all right. 
DWIGHT: What is this? 
GABE: Oh, this is "Print in All Colors," Sabre's minority executive training program. 
DWIGHT: It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing. 
DARRYL: I didn't say "a'ight." 
DWIGHT: How do I apply? 
GABE: You have to be a minority. 
DWIGHT: Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going? 
GABE: Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities. 
DWIGHT: Come here. Come here. 
GABE: Hmm? 
DWIGHT: Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking? 
GABE: Well... 
DARRYL: I like the sound of this.  Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something? 
DWIGHT: One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines? 
KELLY:  This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing. 
DWIGHT: Oh, man. White people, right? 
KELLY: I don't know if she was white. 
DWIGHT: Well, you can kinda tell from the voice. 
KELLY: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race. 
KELLY: Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right. 
DWIGHT: I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program. 
KELLY: Never thought of myself as an executive before. 
DWIGHT: I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of? 
KELLY: I can't think of any CEO's, any race. 
DWIGHT: You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner. 
KELLY: I could be the Indian Julia Roberts. 
DWIGHT: That's not... she's... okay. Yes. 
MICHAEL: I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go!  Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white. 
DONNA: Mm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: And that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black. 
DONNA: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on. 
MICHAEL: This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before. 
DONNA: Who took the photo? 
MICHAEL: Ryan. 
DONNA: Oh.  
MICHAEL: And that's it. That's me. That's who I am. 
DONNA:  Not bad. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thanks.  You're not bad, either. 
DONNA: Thank you.  Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. 
DONNA: Oh my God.  
MICHAEL: Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at? 
MICHAEL:  You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread? 
JIM: No. 
PAM: I'll have one. 
JIM: Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work. 
MICHAEL: Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam. 
JIM: Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant. 
PAM: Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here. 
DONNA: Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering. 
MICHAEL: Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it. 
PAM: What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim? 
JIM: What? 
JIM: What was that? 
PAM: Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways. 
JIM: Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale. 
PAM: Who cares?  It's not that huge a sale. 
JIM: Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale. 
PAM: Don't act like you understood anything that guy said.  Good luck, wingman.  
DWIGHT: How as being a minority affected you? 
KELLY: Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy. 
DWIGHT: Oh, good, and you resent this because... 
KELLY: Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky. 
DWIGHT: Oh, no, no. That's not dorky.  Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house. 
KELLY: Just put it in your pocket. Michael and 
DONNA:  
KEVIN:  Look at that. She's totally flirting with him. 
PHYLLIS: You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality. 
CREED: You ever notice you can ooze two 
THINGS: sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya. 
PHYLLIS: She just crossed her arms together... that's bad. 
PAM: Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger. 
KEVIN:  Like that?  
DONNA: Is this... is this the best you can do right there? 
JIM: Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility. 
DONNA: Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business,  where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like. 
JIM: Yeah.  
MICHAEL: So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right? 
JIM: What's that? 
MICHAEL: Maybe wee find some wiggle room? 
JIM: I don't... I don't think so. 
MICHAEL: I think we could.  
OSCAR: I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost... 
MICHAEL: Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes. 
OSCAR: Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money. 
MICHAEL: Why don't you run them again? 
JIM: What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price? 
MICHAEL: If she is, it's working. 
KEVIN: Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says "no," then she is not interested. 
JIM: She does not like him. 
PAM: You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together? 
JIM: 'cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day. 
PAM: I was after your money. 
JIM: Well, the joke was on you. 
PAM: Yes, it was. 
KELLY:  Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this. 
RYAN: Okay... 
DWIGHT: Hey... what are you guys doing? 
KELLY: This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic. 
RYAN: Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat. 
KELLY: Oh, that is so good. 
DWIGHT: You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview. 
KELLY: Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me. 
DWIGHT: Ryan? What does he know? 
RYAN: It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race? 
KELLY: Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in. 
DWIGHT: "We?" 
KELLY: When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager. 
RYAN: And then the two of us are cleanin' house. 
DWIGHT: Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate. 
MICHAEL: So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller... 
DONNA: Mm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish.  Just kidding. Do you like mints? 
DONNA: Yes. 
MICHAEL: I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those? 
DONNA: Oh, I haven't tried those. No. 
MICHAEL: They're good  
DONNA: You want one? 
MICHAEL: Sure. 
DONNA: It's like cool... "certified cool." I like how they say "certified." Like there's some consortium of...  Michael! 
MICHAEL: I can't stop myself from kissing her. 
KEVIN: Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day. 
ANDY: Well, why don't you just move the M&M's? 
KEVIN: Well, why don't you shut up! 
MICHAEL: Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time. 
JIM: It is totally insane. 
OSCAR: Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker. 
MICHAEL: Okay. What do you think? 
KEVIN: I think it's over, man. 
MICHAEL: Andy? 
ANDY: Ehh. 
MICHAEL: Okay, some for, some against. 
JIM: Nobody's for. 
MICHAEL: Pam? 
PAM: Hmm? 
MIHAEL: What do you think? 
PAM: Um... I think it's really, really unlikely. 
JIM: Okay. 
PAM: Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible. 
JIM: What? 
PAM: I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt. 
MICHAEL: I'm going with Pam's group. 
JIM: Wait. 
MICHAEL: Here we go. 
JIM: Michael. Michael. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
JIM: Michael. 
MICHAEL: No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck. 
JIM: No. 
MICHAEL: What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point. 
DWIGHT: Kelly is disqualified! 
GABE: What? 
DWIGHT: You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America. 
GABE: Yeah, but she's not white, though. 
DWIGHT: Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic. 
GABE: Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone. 
DARRYL: I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though. 
DWIGHT: Kelly is the only applicant. 
GABE: Yeah, unless somebody else applies today. 
KELLY: Namaste. 
DWIGHT: Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back. 
KELLY: Hello. 
GABE: That's very nice.  I never noticed that before. 
KELLY: Sometimes my bangs cover it. 
GABE: Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means? 
KELLY: I do find that offensive, actually. 
MICHAEL: We should have your contract done by Thursday. 
DONNA: Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DONNA: And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you. 
MICHAEL: Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too. 
DONNA: Thank you. Did I... get everything? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. I think so. 
DONNA: Yeah, I think so. 
MICHAEL:  Okay. So... Oh, Donna? 
DONNA: Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate. 
DONNA: No, it's just in the lot, so... 
MICHAEL: Thank you so much. 
DONNA: You're welcome.  You're... welcome. 
MICHAEL: Mmm.  
DONNA: Bye. 
MICHAEL:  Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have... 
DONNA: I don't have, uh, any other questions.  I'm just gonna... make my way down to... 
MICHAEL: All right. All right. Bye. 
DONNA: Bye-bye! 
MICHAEL: And have a good elevator ride. 
DONNA: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, what's that out there? 
KEVIN: Michael, how did it go?  
DWIGHT: How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company? 
ERIN: Holy cow. I'd be so happy. 
DWIGHT: I wasn't talking to you, pale-face. 
ERIN: I know. I meant I'd be happy for them. 
DWIGHT: What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management. 
STANLEY: Dwight, I know these programs. "Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow." 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
STANLEY: I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow. 
ERIN: Mm! 
DWIGHT: Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective. 
OSCAR: Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is. 
DWIGHT: I can protect you from Kelly.  Will you get out of here? Seriously.  
KELLY: For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them. 
DWIGHT: Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program "print in all colors" initiative. 
KELLY: 
DWIGHT: What are you doing? 
DWIGHT: Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour. 
KELLY: God, I hate you so much!  
DWIGHT: Caucasians, am I right?  Have a seat. I'll translate. 
HIDE: Why? I don't need translator. 
DWIGHT: You don't know what you need. Just... 
GABE: Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide. 
HIDE: In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand. 
PAM: Hey, Michael.  How you doing? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore. 
PAM: You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you. 
MICHAEL: She suckered you too. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: Was it the cleavage? 
PAM: Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts. 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far. 
ANDY: You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused. 
ERIN: Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home? 
MICHAEL: God. She left this here? 
ERIN: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work. 
JIM: What? 
ALL: No. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off. 
OSCAR: It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened. 
PAM: Michael... 
MICHAEL:  Well... 
PAM: She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know. I know. 
PAM: I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.  
PAM: Michael!  
MICHAEL:  
DONNA:  Michael! 
MICHAEL: Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette. 
GABE: Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor.  All right. 
GABE: They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right. 
KELLY:  And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore. 
ERIN: Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much? 
KELLY: Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway. 
ERIN: Great. 
DWIGHT: Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it.  
KELLY: Thank you, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
KELLY: I'll never forget everything that you've done for me. 
DWIGHT: Gosh. He he. 
KELLY: Because I never forget anything. 
DWIGHT: Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask? 
MICHAEL: You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette. 
DONNA: No, y-you were... right. 
MICHAEL: Who? 
DONNA: You were right. 
MICHAEL: About what? 
DONNA: You were right.  I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: No, no. No. 
DONNA: I'm sor... 
MICHAEL: No...  
MICHAEL:  What happened? 
ERIN: Kelly got into the minority training program. 
MICHAEL: Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it!  I kissed. We kissed. 
KEVIN: Ooh. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, Michael. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette  We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did. 
MICHAEL: You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts.  I did do it!  
DWIGHT: Stop it! 
JIM: Stop what? 
DWIGHT: You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha! 
JIM:  Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you. 
JIM: Yup. That's exactly what we did. 
PAM: It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, "I will when you lose the baby weight." 
DWIGHT: Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize.  Detonator. Detonator where? Michael! 
MICHAEL: Jim. Are you clicking a detonator? 
JIM: It's a pen. 
DWIGHT: Michael, come on. 
MICHAEL: Get back to work, Dwight. Please. 
DWIGHT: Fine.  Hey. Tap away.  
MICHAEL: Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it! 
MICHAEL: Who enjoys the weekends?  Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did.  And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out. 
STANLEY: I have an idea for your weekend. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
STANLEY: Let me get back to my desk right now. 
MICHAEL: Okay, you get out of here, big dog.  Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas. 
PAM: Stanley got to go. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out. 
ANDY: Walk around apple orchards. 
MICHAEL: Oh! 
ANDY: Super romantic. 
MICHAEL: That's fun. 
DWIGHT: Eel fishing. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
DARRYL: Curl up with your favorite DVD. 
MEREDITH: You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three. 
MICHAEL: We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's. 
KELLY: Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton. 
MICHAEL: Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to Mount Pocono," you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI. 
KELLY: Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating? 
MICHAEL: You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real 
WORLD: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see. 
RYAN: Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana. 
MICHAEL: You guys think Donna's cheating on me? 
PAM: No, Michael, no. 
DWIGHT: Are you nuts? 
PAM: You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place... 
MICHAEL: ... and... we had sex, too. 
PAM: That is right. Don't make any more of it. 
MICHAEL: How? 
PAM: How what? 
MICHAEL: How do I not make any more of it? 
PAM: You could start by concluding this meeting. 
MICHAEL: All right.  And she won't say, "I love you." 
DWIGHT: Oh, no. 
ANDY: How many dates have you been on? 
MICHAEL: Nine dates. I said it on the second date. 
ANDY: Mm. 
OSCAR: That seems... quick. Even for lesbians. 
RYAN: Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael? 
RYAN: Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, she does all that. 
RYAN: Sorry, dude. 
MICHAEL: No, no... 
PAM: Michael, do not let your imagination run amok. 
MICHAEL: Run what? 
PAM: Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control. 
MICHAEL: Why didn't you just say that, Pam? 
PAM: Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world. 
JIM: You do? 
MICHAEL: Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit. 
JIM: But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago. 
MICHAEL: That's what makes it so wrong. 
MICHAEL: Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me. 
DWIGHT: Oh, God, that tickles. What did... 
MICHAEL:  I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator. 
DWIGHT: I think I've got one for you.  
MICHAEL: This is you. How much do you charge? 
DWIGHT: $100 a day, plus expenses. 
MICHAEL: I'll give you $50. Money's no object. 
DWIGHT: I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DWIGHT: And you might not like how I find it.  
ANDY: Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire. 
STANLEY: My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems. 
ANDY: Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important. 
GABE: There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right? 
ANDY: Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire. 
GABE: That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves. 
ANDY: What are we gonna do about this? 
GABE: I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah. 
ANDY: Let me know what they say. 
DARRYL:  Wow. That dude is good. 
ANDY: What do you mean? 
DARRYL: You didn't feel like he was hiding something? 
ANDY: I don't know. 
DARRYL: Like he was... covering something up? Maybe. 
DARRYL: Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said "Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient."  
DWIGHT:  Hi stranger. 
DONNA: Oh, hi. You work for Michael. 
DWIGHT: I work with Michael. 
DONNA: Right. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute.  
DONNA: Donna, hi. 
DWIGHT: All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news. 
JIM: That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think? 
MICHAEL: It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives. 
PAM: Oh!... 
JIM: Oh, my God 
MICHAEL: It's comfort food, all right?  God. 
JIM: You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up. 
MICHAEL: I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says. 
PAM: Why do we have to see what Dwight says? 
MICHAEL: Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update. 
JIM: Michael, no... 
PAM: No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that. 
MICHAEL: It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok. 
PAM: Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael. 
MICHAEL: God, this is so disgusting. 
PAM: Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
PAM: And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in. 
MICHAEL: That's not true.  You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan. 
PAM: Helene. 
MICHAEL: Helene? 
PAM: My mother. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
PAM: My mother, Helene.  
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life. 
JIM: You should stop this,  and you should call Dwight right now. 
MICHAEL:  All right.  
DWIGHT:  Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead. 
DONNA: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: It's all yours.  Ah!  
DONNA: You okay? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body? 
DONNA:  Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about. 
DWIGHT: Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here. 
DWIGHT:  Oh. Oh. Oh.  One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops.  You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse? 
DONNA: Nope. I'm good, thanks. 
DWIGHT: Really? Hey, um...  Old 
LADY: Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat? 
DWIGHT: Get out of my way. Huh! 
DWIGHT: Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right? 
DONNA: I'm out of here. 
DWIGHT: Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm 
HERE: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked. 
DONNA: You stay away from me, or I'm calling security. 
DWIGHT: Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh!  
MICHAEL: You're back. What happened? 
DWIGHT: Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking. 
MICHAEL: No, what happened with Donna? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here.  
MICHAEL: Ugh! 
DWIGHT: Put your fingers here. 
MICHAEL: No. No! Are you sure? 
DWIGHT: I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there. 
MICHAEL: Who eats eight protein bars? 
DWIGHT: People who don't trust egg whites. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over. 
DWIGHT: Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious. 
MICHAEL: What? No, she didn't say that. 
DWIGHT: You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was,  "What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him." And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly.  Ohhh... mmm... 
ERIN: Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office. 
MICHAEL: No, I like the attention. Is she here yet? 
ERIN: Uh, no.  Wait, yes. 
MICHAEL: That's her? 
ERIN: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right.  Okay, I'll talk to you later. 
DONNA: How could you think I would cheat on you? 
MICHAEL: I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind. 
DONNA: That's pathetic. 
MICHAEL: Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want. 
DONNA: When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak.  
MICHAEL: If you wanna dump me, I totally get it. 
DONNA: I told you I like you. 
MICHAEL: Well, you are boner-ific.  
DONNA: Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would... 
MICHAEL: ...poop my pants. 
DONNA: Have you ever been to Vero Beach? 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water? 
DONNA: We're going. 
MICHAEL: We are? 
DONNA: Yeah. 
ANDY: What's up? I got your e-mail. 
DARRYL: Close the door. 
ANDY: Okay. 
DARRYL: I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz.  Andy don't mess with me.  I'll figure something out. 
DARRYL: Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things. 
ANDY: Such as? 
DARRYL: It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was "Andy," "Problem," "Eliminate," something. I don't know what it meant. 
ANDY: What? You don't know what it meant? How about "Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?" 
DARRYL: Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that. 
ANDY:  Yeah. Hah. Hoo. 
KELLY: Oh, hey, I love your earrings. 
DONNA: Thank you. 
KELLY: Did Michael get them for you? 
DONNA: No, I bought them myself. 
KELLY: Where? 
DONNA: Steamtown Mall. 
KELLY: Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where? 
DONNA: You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there. 
KELLY: Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place? 
DONNA: Uh, Franklin Mills. 
JIM:  What? 
PAM: Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing. 
PAM: Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael. 
JIM: Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right? 
PAM: No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love. 
CREED: Psst...  
ANDY: Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this. 
CREED: So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this.  Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less. 
PAM: So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online.  This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night.  This photo was taken this morning.  It's Cece.  She's never gonna do anything wrong. 
DONNA: Isn't that something? 
MICHAEL: Wow.  That's exciting. 
PAM: Hey, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
PAM: I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related. 
MICHAEL: Well it can wait. It can wait. 
PAM: I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to. 
MICHAEL: Jim is her husband. 
DONNA: Oh. 
PAM: And... 
MICHAEL: And they are having problems, so sh... 
PAM: No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love... 
MICHAEL: Good in bed. 
PAM: Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim. 
MICHAEL: Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching? 
PAM:  I need you to sign this! So bad! 
MICHAEL: Okay, weirdo. 
PAM: I love ... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely.  
DONNA: Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done. 
PAM:  You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing.  Are you a golfer? 
DONNA: I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much.  Hey, you okay?  
MICHAEL: Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam? 
PAM: Absolutely.  
DARRYL: Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself. 
GLEN: I know, it's just, I'm scared... 
ANDY: Your text said 911. 
DARRYL: Glen, could you excuse us?  
DARRYL: It's bad. 
ANDY: What's bad? 
DARRYL: It's real bad. 
DARRYL: Still no plan. 
ANDY: Oh, God. 
DARRYL: It's getting bigger. 
ANDY: I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire. 
DARRYL: I can videotape it. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
DARRYL:  There it is. 
ANDY: There what is? 
DARRYL: What? 
MICHAEL: Who the hell is this? Who is this guy? 
PAM: I don't know who he is. 
MICHAEL: God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what? 
PAM: What? 
MICHAEL: I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him. 
PAM: You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her. 
MICHAEL: I have to hear it from her. 
PAM: You have to settle down first. 
MICHAEL: I need to have her tell me herself. Right? 
PAM: Okay. Okay. Yes. 
MICHAEL: I need to have her say... 
PAM: Yeah, but you have to calm... 
MICHAEL: I need to say, "What the hell is that? What the hell is that?" 
PAM: Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture. 
MICHAEL: No, God! No, no, oh, my God! 
PAM:  Hi, Michael, hi, Michael 
MICHAEL:  Okay. Okay. Okay. 
GABE:  I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000.  We've investigated. Every time it's been user error. They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that.  That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts.  
MICHAEL: You know what? We should really do something fun this week. 
DONNA: Yeah, we should. 
MICHAEL: Wouldn't that be fun? 
DONNA: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: How about Thursday? 
DONNA: Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do? 
MICHAEL: I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday? 
DONNA: Oh, Friday doesn't work. 
MICHAEL: Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert. 
DONNA: Shoot. I'm working. 
MICHAEL: Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by. 
DONNA: Well, won't you be at the concert? 
MICHAEL: Nope, that's Tuesday. 
DONNA: Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday. 
MICHAEL: You're cheating. You're cheating on me. 
DONNA: How do you know? 
MICHAEL: Pam told me.  
PAM:  Did she see me? 
JIM:  Nice effort. 
ANDY:  We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress.  
DARRYL: You haven't even introduced yourself. 
ANDY: Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much. 
DARRYL: You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird. 
ANDY: Higher? Okay.  Recently certain events have come to my attention... 
DARRYL: Higher.  
ANDY: Make it higher? Okay. 
DARRYL: Mm-hmm 
ANDY:  I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation... 
DARRYL: One more, yeah.  
ANDY:  May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger...  ah!  It's working.  It's... I knew it! 
DARRYL: This...  
ANDY: We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off!  Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing. 
DARRYL: I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore. 
MICHAEL: Who is he? 
DONNA: What, what do you mean? 
MICHAEL: The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it? 
DONNA: It's you. I'm married. 
MICHAEL: I'm the mistress? 
DWIGHT:  Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill. Gym 
INSTRUCTOR: Excuse me. Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you'd just let me run this. 
DWIGHT: You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast! Gym 
INSTRUCTOR: Don't listen to him, we're approaching a cooldown down a gentle hill. 
DWIGHT: No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side. Gym 
INSTRUCTOR: No, guys, no. We're just cooling down... 
DWIGHT: If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No!  You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate. 
TOBY: This here is a radon test kit.  Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out.  This is a radon test kit.  Please don't throw these out.  See them all over the office. 
MICHAEL: Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap.  But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.  The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.  Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite.  
MICHAEL: Pfffffttt. 
TOBY: Come on, Michael. You're interrupting. 
MICHAEL: You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this? 
TOBY: Please sit down. 
MICHAEL: You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom. 
EVERYONE: YEAH!  
MICHAEL: Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice. 
EVERYONE: No. No! 
JIM: That's... not okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay, alright. 
DWIGHT: You were being really funny, and then you went too far. 
MICHAEL: I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby. 
DWIGHT: No, hmmm... that's still... 
EVERYONE: Mm-mm. 
MICHAEL: Okay geniuses, how would you do it? 
CREED: Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted. 
OSCAR: All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden... 
RYAN: Is there a curtain rod in the room? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. 
STANLEY: How about make-believe land has anything you want? 
JIM: Stanley, please, this is serious! 
ANGELA: Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence? 
MICHAEL: Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle. 
DWIGHT: Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do 
IT: You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this.  Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together. 
TOBY: I don't wanna do this. 
MICHAEL:  Toby, just do it! God! 
DWIGHT: Toby, come on.  
DWIGHT: Ready, one bullet. And boom!  
EVERYONE: Yeah, that works. That works! 
MICHAEL: Good work.  
PAM: What flavors did you get?  
ERIN: It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60. 
PAM:  Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this? 
ERIN: Do you want me to go back to the store? 
PAM: No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up. 
ERIN: This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married. 
PAM: Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this. 
ERIN: After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me. 
PAM:  Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this. 
ERIN: That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though. 
ERIN: We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him. 
PAM: And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up. 
ERIN: He's coming. 
PAM: Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay. 
TOBY:  Hey everyone. 
PAM: No, out! Get out now! Leave now. 
DWIGHT: Leave, get outta here. 
PAM: Leave! 
DWIGHT: Right now! 
PAM: Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay? 
MICHAEL:  Morning everyone. 
EVERYONE: Hey!  Hey, hey! 
ERIN: Hi Michael.  
MICHAEL: Hello! 
DWIGHT: Michael, nice tie or something. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think.  
KEVIN: That's hilarious. 
PAM: That's awesome. You want some ice cream? 
MICHAEL: Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share? 
KEVIN: Boi-oi-oi-ing 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later. 
LAWYER: I don't follow this exactly. Uh, "The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have..." Dwight and 
ANGELA: Joint custody 
LAWYER: Are we talking about your grandchildren? 
ANGELA: No. 
DWIGHT: No. 
ANGELA: Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract. 
DWIGHT: Alleged contract. 
ANGELA: Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over. 
DWIGHT: Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah!  See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it. 
DWIGHT: So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse? 
ANGELA: I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting. 
DWIGHT: How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample. 
ANGELA: Dwight, look at my teeth.  
DWIGHT: Eughh.  
ANDY: No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there. 
PAM: Could he still be seeing her? 
PHYLLIS: I don't think he'd do that. 
JIM: So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight? 
ANDY: Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big. 
JIM: Exactly. It happened in Big. 
MICHAEL: No, I gotta go. Text me later. 
JIM: I'm really too tired to do this. 
PAM: Me too! 
JIM: Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved? 
PAM: Hey Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
PAM: We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby. 
JIM: We can order in from Hooters. 
MICHAEL: Oh, Hooters to go. Nice. 
PAM: We can watch a movie and play Rock Band. 
JIM: Billy Joel Rock Band. 
MICHAEL: That... exists? 
PAM: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer. 
PAM:  Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna? 
MICHAEL: Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions. 
PHYLLIS: Oh Michael. 
MICHAEL: Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives? 
MICHAEL: I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong. 
MEREDITH: That is something I would never do. 
MICHAEL: Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith. 
MEREDITH: Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with. 
MEREDITH: I ask... everyone in the room, "Are you in a relationship?". 
MICHAEL: People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers. 
KELLY: Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore. 
RYAN: Okay. 
MICHAEL: I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer. 
ANDY: How does he feel about it? 
MICHAEL: He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.  It was right under his nose. I had to tell him. 
JIM: Now you're just being hurtful. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat... 
PHYLLIS: Hey! 
MICHAEL: On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit. 
ANDY: Did Donna tell you that? 
MICHAEL: Real sports with Bryant Gumble. 
ANDY: So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy. 
MICHAEL: You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson. 
ANDY: My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage. 
ANDY: So... here's the thing about infidelity. 
MICHAEL: Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy. 
ANDY: How does that work? 
MICHAEL: Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him. 
ANDY: In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce. 
MICHAEL: I am Beyonce always. 
ANDY: Not this time. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I am. 
ANDY: This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is. 
MICHAEL: I would love that. 
ANDY: Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out. 
MICHAEL: I have work to do. 
ANDY: Oh, really? I thought you were the boss. 
MICHAEL: Let's go.  I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her. 
ANDY:  Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum 
MICHAEL: All right, Andy, please. 
ANDY: Baseball! 
MICHAEL: Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him. 
ANDY: Where? 
MICHAEL: Right there. The coach! 
ANDY: Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees! 
MICHAEL: Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base? 
ANDY:  And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain. 
MICHAEL: All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please? 
ANDY: Whatever. I'm the one blending in. 
GABE:  Guys? 
JIM: Pam. 
PAM: Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe. 
GABE: Can you two please join me in my office? Now. 
PAM: You were supposed to be the Lookout. 
JIM: Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag. 
GABE: I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad. 
JIM: Sorry about that. 
PAM: So embarrassing. 
GABE: Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics. 
JIM: Well, you were surprisingly restrained. 
PAM: We will be well-rested tomorrow. 
GABE: Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else. 
JIM: Excellent. Go for it. 
GABE: I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on.  Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way? 
JIM: Right? So, uh, let's uh... 
LAWYER: Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button. 
ANGELA: Same page. Go to the next one. 
DWIGHT: Same page. Just keep moving. 
LAWYER: Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix-- 
DWIGHT: Which we can't know. 
LAWYER: This is essentially... 
DWIGHT: Unless we're unplugged. 
LAWYER: Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor. 
DWIGHT: And wake up in the future. 
LAWYER: Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract. 
DWIGHT: What? 
LAWYER: Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else. 
ANGELA: What? 
LAWYER: So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000. 
DWIGHT: What? 
DWIGHT: I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it. 
ANDY: Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play. 
MICHAEL: You have no idea what you're talking about. 
ANDY: I know it's like cricket. 
MICHAEL: You don't. No, no. 
ANDY: And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket. 
MICHAEL: You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit." 
ANDY: Seems pretty well liked by the team. 
MICHAEL: Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary. 
ANDY: You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism. 
DWIGHT: $30,000? There's gotta be another way. 
ANGELA: He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune. 
DWIGHT: Look, I will not pay. 
ANGELA: Well, I have an alternative. 
DWIGHT: "Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?" 
LAWYER: Look, I don't think that's actually legal. 
DWIGHT: Agreed.  
DWIGHT: Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses. 
DWIGHT: But not in your bed. It's lumpy. 
ANGELA: Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy. 
DWIGHT: Fine. Five times.  
LAWYER: Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution. 
ANGELA: I want eye contact. 
DWIGHT: No. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Do you understand how rare is that in nature? 
ANGELA: I'm not some farm animal.  
ANDY: Great game, coach. 
MICHAEL: Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't. 
ANDY: You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life. 
SHANE: Yeah, right. You must be rootin' for the other guys. 
ANDY: Ha. The other guys can go die. 
MICHAEL:  Okay. 
ANDY: Baseball! Go talk to him. 
MICHAEL: No. God. You go talk to him. 
SHANE: Let's go. 
ANDY: Shane. Great game man! 
SHANE: Do I know you? 
ANDY: No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us. 
SHANE: Are you somebody's... parents? Oh, are you guys... Kenny's dads? 
ANDY: Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball.  
SHANE: Okay. 
ANDY: But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot. 
SHANE: Okay. Let's go! 
ANDY: Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage. 
SHANE: Whoa! 
ANDY: I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person. 
SHANE: Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just trying to... focus here on the game. 
ANDY: I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife. 
SHANE: Of course. Okay? I gotta... get back to this. 
ANDY: Of course. 
SHANE: All right. 
ANDY: But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon! 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. 
ANDY: Come on, get over here. 
MICHAEL: I'm good. Oh, my God. 
ANDY: Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach. 
MICHAEL: Sorry. I got some stomach cramps. 
SHANE: It's all right. It's all right. Keep it going. 
MICHAEL: Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "I'm sleeping with your wife." And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond. 
MICHAEL: Okay, orange slices. There ya go. 
ERIN: Thanks, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo! 
OSCAR: Why would you throw something wet at me? 
MICHAEL: You love it. There ya go. 
JIM: Now, were those for the team? 
MICHAEL: Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks. 
JIM: Ah. 
PAM: I don't think those were yours to take. 
MICHAEL: Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane. 
ANDY: I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior. 
PAM: Did you talk to him? 
MICHAEL: I did. 
PAM: You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with. 
KEVIN: Wow. That is crazy. 
PHYLLIS: Was there a fistfight? 
MICHAEL: No. We just talked. He's very nice. 
PHYLLIS: And it didn't change your mind. 
MICHAEL: It did not. 
PHYLLIS: Michael, that's awful. 
MICHAEL: Isn't it? 
PHYLLIS: Yes. 
MICHAEL: I'm awful, aren't I? 
KEVIN: Yeah. That's pretty bad. 
MICHAEL: I'm an awful guy! Ooh! 
OSCAR: How can you live with yourself? 
MICHAEL: I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for. 
KEVIN: That is a dangerous game, friendo. 
KELLY: Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store. 
RYAN: I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore. 
KELLY: 'Cause it's next to they baby section, okay? 
RYAN: All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, "I read a book about anthropology." 
KELLY: I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now. 
RYAN: I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming. 
KELLY: That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday. 
MICHAEL: I don't care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon. 
RYAN: Good for you, man. Good for you. 
RYAN: He takes what he wants. 
RYAN: You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you. 
ERIN: What about Kelly? 
RYAN: You read my mind. 
ERIN:  Is this a joke? 
RYAN: Yep. 
RYAN: It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold. 
MICHAEL: You'll learn, baby. You'll learn. 
DWIGHT:  I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong,  but they're no match for a grown Schrute man.    Let's see what she gets.   Aah! 
CREED:  Uh, boss, we're out of paper. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I noticed that. 
CREED: Are you gonna add any more? 
MICHAEL: Nope. 
CREED: He don't give an "F" about nothin'! 
MICHAEL: I have got big balls. 
PAM: I don't think I'm gonna make it. 
JIM:  What about an energy drink or something? 
PAM:  It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later. 
JIM: Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it. 
PAM: Well, it does and it doesn't. 
DARRYL: Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place. 
JIM: A place? 
DARRYL: A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift. 
PAM: You sleep in the warehouse? 
DARRYL: Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay? 
JIM: Okay. 
DARRYL: Pam. 
PAM: Okay. 
PHYLLIS: For your signature.  
MICHAEL: Okay.  Phyllis. Okay. Look at me.  Phyllis, look at--  okay, that's...  All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna. 
KEVIN: Why not your condo? 
MICHAEL: Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate. 
STANLEY: Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything. 
ANDY: Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to. 
MICHAEL: Nobody better try to stop me. Good.  
DWIGHT: I could have stopped him. 
DWIGHT: Are you warmed up?  
ANGELA: No. 
DWIGHT: God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?  
ANGELA: What did you do to yourself?  
DWIGHT: Never mind. Just never mind. 
ANGELA: Well, it better work. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it'll work.  Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract. 
MICHAEL:  How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud.  Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision.  At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former. 
REPORTER: Michael Scott? 
MICHAEL: Yes? 
REPORTER: Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors? 
MICHAEL:  Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again. 
REPORTER: I'm talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on? 
MICHAEL:  There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed.  Michael Scott, as seen on TV. Todd 
PACKER:  I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener...  It's Packer! 
MICHAEL: OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl! 
MICHAEL: Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough. 
MICHAEL: Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site. 
OSCAR: What's number one? 
MICHAEL: Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times. 
JIM: So instead of working, you want... 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
JIM: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it! 
ANGELA: Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site! 
PHYLLIS: Awww, it's kissing its mommy! 
MICHAEL: Please. 
DWIGHT: Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever. 
MICHAEL: Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up.  It's trying to stand up...  there it goes. 
JO: Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. 
MICHAEL: Jo! We were not expecting you! 
JO: 'Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here. 
KEVIN: No. 
JO: Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn't quite as racy, but uh... let's give it a go. 
KEVIN: Jo, I think that I know what happened. 
JO: I'm not sure you do, teddy bear. 
KEVIN: Well, now I think I might not. 
JO: Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please. 
MICHAEL: Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office. 
JO: Can you now? 
MICHAEL: Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand. 
PHYLLIS:  Put your hand up, Norma Rae. 
ANDY: If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets. 
ANDY: So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us.  Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today? 
JO:  It's a little form, says "I did not do it." 
MICHAEL: There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like... 
JO: All that's just birthday information, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture. 
JO: Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho, what'cha say? 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
JO: When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she'd ask one 
QUESTION: What do we do when we find the guilty party? And if they said, "Come down on him with that swift hammer of justice!", innocent. A clear conscience don't need no mercy. But if they said "Officer Bessie, well they may have had a reason, blah blah blah blah", well nine times out of ten, that's the anus they'd check. 
JO: So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him? 
MICHAEL: We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda. 
JO: Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay. 
MICHAEL: Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can. 
JO: Well, I guess we're all right, Michael. 
MICHAEL: I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right. 
JO: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
NICK: Hey Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Hey, IT guy. 
NICK: Mind if I get in there for a second? 
DWIGHT: Oh, sure thing, go ahead. 
NICK: Just one...  Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell? 
DWIGHT: Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer? 
OSCAR: The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother. 
DWIGHT: You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide. 
KEVIN: Wait, are they searching all our computers? 
NICK: Yeah.  I already got to yours, Kevin.  
KEVIN: No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner. 
ANGELA: Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth! 
MICHAEL: Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers. 
PHYLLIS: Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy. 
JO: Okay Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here...  You should fire the following people. 
JO: Well, I'm inclined to believe you. 
DWIGHT: Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams? 
JO: Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money? 
DWIGHT: Are you referring to alchemy? 
JO: I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy. 
DWIGHT: I'm not dumb. I'm smart. 
JO: Well, buy property. That's my advice. 
MICHAEL: Is there something that you would like to say to me? 
ANDY: Uh... 
MICHAEL: About talking to the press? 
ANDY: I, I didn't know. I didn't do that! 
MICHAEL: Mmhmm. 
ANDY: Okay? I, I... didn't do it. 
MICHAEL: I don't believe you. 
ANDY: I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet. 
MICHAEL: That's a little much. All right, all right, all right. 
ANDY: I don't care, that's how much I swear! 
MICHAEL: Okay, I believe you, I believe you. 
ANDY: I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me. 
MICHAEL: Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire? 
DARRYL: Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no, no, no... 
DARRYL: I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib. 
MICHAEL: Oh my god. Was she cute? 
DARRYL: No. 
MICHAEL: Oh, god, Darryl! 
MICHAEL: I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is. 
JO: Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was. 
TOBY: Well, that's... 
JO: And we didn't find anything on your computer. 
TOBY: Good. 
JO: Except this.  
TOBY: Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on. 
JO: I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid? 
TOBY: Oh, uh, I don't know, uh... 
JO: The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder. 
TOBY: Oh... yes. 
TOBY: Write your own damn novel. 
PAM: It was me. 
JIM: What was you? You were the leak? 
PAM: Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare... 
JIM: Uh-huh. 
PAM: She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously! 
JIM: Why'd you do that? 
PAM: Her husband's a reporter. 
JIM: Yeah. 
PAM: So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do. 
JIM: Okay, just relax. Just need to relax. 
PAM: I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael. 
JIM: This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out. 
MICHAEL: You leaked it? 
PAM: I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person! 
MICHAEL: I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour. 
PAM: That fast? 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said. 
PAM:  Yeah?  I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me. 
MICHAEL: So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes. 
PAM: Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it. 
PAM:  I have never seen so many parking tickets. 
DARRYL: All right, this is just messed up. 
MICHAEL: No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think. 
DARRYL: All right. 
MICHAEL: What do we got? 
PAM: Um... 
KELLY:  Hey guys, sorry I'm late. 
PAM: We're not going for yogurt. 
MICHAEL: It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew. 
KELLY: Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue. 
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue. 
KELLY: Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof... 
RYAN: Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you.  I just sent myself a Woof.  
ERIN:  Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1. 
RYAN: Thank you, Erin. Woof! 
MICHAEL: Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case. 
PAM: Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers? 
MICHAEL: No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers. 
KELLY: That idea sucks. 
PAM: I don't think that's a good idea. 
MICHAEL: Just don't say no. 
DARRYL: Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat. 
KELLY: Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl. 
MICHAEL: That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just... 
PAM: Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe. 
MICHAEL: Okay. You can count on me. 
DWIGHT:  Let me give you a hand. 
TOBY: I'm hungry. 
DWIGHT: Ready?  Got it? Oh shoot. Got it?  Dwight Schrute. 
REALTOR:  The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office. 
DWIGHT: Basement office? You mean like a lair? 
MICHAEL: Hey Jo. 
JO: Michael. 
MICHAEL: I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it. 
JO: Michael Scott... what do you know? 
MICHAEL: What? 
MICHAEL: It doesn't matter what I know. 
JO: If it doesn't matter, then tell me. 
MICHAEL: Why? 
JO: Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it. 
MICHAEL: Well, deal with this.  
JO: Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who's giving me the silent treatment... Speak to me... speak.  Come with me. 
MICHAEL: What? 
GABE:  Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation? 
MICHAEL: Are you going to kill me? 
JO: Hahahahahaha. 
REALTOR:  I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
REALTOR: What time works for you?  Mr. Schrute, what time works? 
DWIGHT: Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it. 
REALTOR: But...  
MICHAEL:  Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police. 
CREED: I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you. 
GABE: All right. Uh, Stan, you're up. 
STANLEY: It wasn't me. 
GABE: What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it.  
ANDY: What? Based on what? 
GABE: Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels? 
DWIGHT: All right. Sounds good. 
JIM: Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy. 
ANDY: Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim. 
JIM: Really? 
JO: Michael. 
MICHAEL: I have rights. 
JO: Let's just talk. 
MICHAEL: I am not going to tell you anything. 
JO: Honey, you don't seem like your normal self. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch. 
JO: Mama Jo knew there was something up. 
MICHAEL: Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down. 
JO: Oh, I hate that. 
MICHAEL: And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly. 
JO: Who's Holly? 
MICHAEL: Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down. 
KEVIN: Well, I think that the real question 
IS: Who is the whistleblower? 
DWIGHT: Oh, just... David 
WALLACE: I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it. 
ANDY: Gabe, I told you all about the printers. 
JIM: I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point. 
PAM: Yes, it's totally obvious. 
CREED: I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela.  It's Angela. Get her, boys. 
NICK: Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I'm going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers. 
GABE: Uh, not now. 
NICK: Oh yeah, it's just that my friends are in the car waiting, so I thought I would... 
STANLEY:  Phyllis, what's this guy's name again? 
PHYLLIS: I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I... 
NICK: My name is Nick. 
ANGELA: Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting. 
NICK: Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me. 
JIM: Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally. 
NICK: You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already? 
JIM: No... sport. 
NICK: You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name? 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch. 
NICK: Thank you so much for that. I saw all your hard drives, and guess what?  You're not a photographer.  And you definitely can't fit into a size two. Darryl, man, you're on Facebook. Why you been telling people you're not on Facebook? People want to be your friend, man! All right? And you.  This guy, you're the one who told the press. You wrote an e-mail to the editor. I saw it, and I also saw a QuickTime movie of your little printer fire test on your hard drive. This guy's the snitch, he's the snitch. So that's it, check it out.  
ANDY: You're going to believe that guy? 
JO: When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me. 
MICHAEL: Hmm, hmm. 
JO: I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie. 
MICHAEL: You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you. 
JO: Oh honey, surely you don't want that. 
MICHAEL: I, I surely do, and don't call me honey.  You were playing too. 
DWIGHT: I'm about to buy this building, you know. 
HANK: You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston. 
DWIGHT: Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace. 
ANDY: Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag? 
PHYLLIS:  You deserve it. 
ANDY: Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I... 
KEVIN:  No, it does not! 
ANDY: Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either. 
ANGELA: It does! 
ERIN: Andy? 
ANDY: Hey. 
ERIN: I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press. 
ANDY: Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do. 
ERIN: Yeah. 
MICHAEL:  We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions? 
JO: Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there. 
MICHAEL: That was fun. 
JO: I hope your rough patch ends soon. 
MICHAEL: Thanks. Today helped. 
JO: Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua. 
JO: Let me see what I can do.
