RYAN: Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's uh, old job. Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will not say "Ryan Howard is a temp." It will say "Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate at a mid-range paper supply firm. ...that'll show 'em. 
JIM:  You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that. 
PAM: Me too. ...I think we're just drunk. 
JIM: No I'm not drunk. Are you drunk? 
PAM: No...  Jim--- 
JIM: Are you really gonna marry him?  ...Ok. 
DWIGHT:  Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  False. I do not miss him. 
MICHAEL: No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody "faggie". Why would anybody find that offensive? 
TOBY: OK I think Oscar would just like if you used "lame" or something like that. 
MICHAEL: That's what faggie means! 
TOBY: No not really... 
TOBY: Apparently you called Oscar "faggie" for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie. 
MICHAEL: It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard! 
TOBY: All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay. 
MICHAEL: Exactly! 
TOBY: I mean for real. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know. 
TOBY: No, I mean he's attracted to other men. 
MICHAEL: OK, a little too far, crossed the line. 
TOBY: OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah, he told me this morning. And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion. 
MICHAEL: I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't... You don't call retarded people "retards". It's bad taste. You call your friends "retards" when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend. 
MICHAEL: Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea. 
OSCAR: No, it's fine. 
MICHAEL: No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people "faggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude. 
OSCAR: That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that. 
ANGELA:  It explains so much. 
OSCAR: No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if...  Uh... yeah I'm gay. 
JIM: I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable. 
JIM: Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can't beat that view... right? 
ANDY: Hey, Big Tuna! You're single right? 
JIM: Uh-huh, yeah. I am. 
ANDY: She's pretty hot huh?  She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters. 
JIM: OooOK. 
ANDY: OooOK. 
JIM: I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name. 
ANDY: Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?  I graduated in four years. I never studied once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, "Here Comes Treble." 
JOSH: So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber. Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them. 
JIM: Oh, I can do that. 
KAREN: Jim's nice enough. I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  What is that? 
MICHAEL: Can you tell who's gay and who's not? 
DWIGHT: Of course. 
MICHAEL: What about Oscar? 
DWIGHT: Absolutely not. 
MICHAEL: Well, he is. 
DWIGHT: Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so... 
MICHAEL:  There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else. 
DWIGHT: You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay. 
MICHAEL: Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman. 
DWIGHT: I really don't think so. 
MICHAEL: I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you? 
DWIGHT:  
MICHAEL: Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them. 
DWIGHT: Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online. 
MICHAEL: That's ridiculous. 
DWIGHT: Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot. 
MICHAEL:  Let's call him and get the website. 
DWIGHT: Definitely. 
JIM: What's gay-dar? Oh, oh, gay-dar, yes! No, uh, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I could check for you. No problem.  It's sold out! Yeah sorry about that, that's a bummer. 
MICHAEL: Well, they're sold out. 
DWIGHT: Damn.  I'll try Brookstone. 
JIM: I miss that. 
ROY: Chicken or fish? 
PAM:  Chicken. 
ROY: So you havin' a good day? 
PAM: Excellent, thanks. 
ROY: Good, glad. OK. 
PAM: Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks. 
ROY: After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest. I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted. I gotta win her back. 
STANLEY: I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters. 
KELLY: That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you. 
OSCAR: Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan. 
ANGELA: Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented. 
ANDY: OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND! 
JAN: You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation. 
MICHAEL: I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so... 
JAN: That's not what it's called. 
TOBY: OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today? 
MICHAEL: What? What does that even... 
JAN: Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it. 
MICHAEL: Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival. 
TOBY: All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault. 
MICHAEL: I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about? 
JAN: NO! 
MICHAEL: I don't kn-- 
JAN: No, it's not possible. 
MICHAEL: Anything's possible. 
JAN: You know, imagine... you were gay. 
MICHAEL:  Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody! 
JAN: Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand? 
MICHAEL: The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays. 
OSCAR: Am I the first gay man you ever knew? 
MICHAEL: Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer? 
PAM: Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer. 
DWIGHT: Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons. 
MICHAEL:  Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay porn, straight porn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful. 
DWIGHT: Ah damn pop-ups. 
OSCAR: What are you doing?! 
ANGELA: Watching some of your friends. 
MICHAEL:  All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW! 
MICHAEL: Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men. 
MICHAEL: We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you. 
OSCAR: Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now? 
CREED:: I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain. And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing. 
MICHAEL: Who should be the judges and juries of our society? 
ANGELA: Judges and juries! 
MICHAEL: Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right? 
KEVIN:: That sounds great. 
DWIGHT: I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them. 
OSCAR: No one else in this office is gay. 
DWIGHT: What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine! 
PHYLLIS: I'm getting married to Bob Vance. 
MICHAEL: That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  See? Everybody has a chance! 
MICHAEL: But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do! 
PHYLLIS: No, you knew me in high school. Course, we all thought you were gay in high school. 
MICHAEL:  Right!  And I take that as a compliment. 
PHYLLIS: Well with your ties and your matching socks and --- 
MICHAEL: Well, I just like to look good OK, so --- 
OSCAR: You sound pretty defensive Michael. 
MICHAEL: No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero! 
OSCAR: I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here. 
MICHAEL: No no no. The only signal that I am sending 
IS: Gay, good. 
MICHAEL: Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag. 
OSCAR: I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life. 
MICHAEL: You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend --- 
OSCAR: I would rather not. 
MICHAEL: ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me! 
OSCAR: No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small! 
MICHAEL: All right, um... sorry. 
OSCAR: Michael... I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on.  
MICHAEL:  I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy. 
DWIGHT: Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend. 
MICHAEL: You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here.  
MICHAEL:  Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man! 
MICHAEL: We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way? 
MICHAEL: I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said. 
MICHAEL: Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows? 
OSCAR: I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay. 
DWIGHT:  "Hope this helps. -Jim" Nice! 
OSCAR:  What are you doing?! 
DWIGHT: Shhh. Don't be scared.  It works.  ...oh no. 
MICHAEL: Pam? 
PAM: Yeah? 
MICHAEL: Did you see Oprah yesterday? 
PAM: No, I didn't. 
MICHAEL: I, uh... I am going to be a father. 
PAM: What was Oprah about? 
MICHAEL: Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost. 
PAM: That's a really big decision. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
PAM: Maybe you should wait before you adopt. 
MICHAEL: Well... 
PAM: Or not adopt. 
MICHAEL: Just do it, okay? 
PAM: Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars. 
MICHAEL: Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay? 
PAM: You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months. 
MICHAEL: Eight months? 
PAM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months. 
PAM: You probably won't. 
MICHAEL: You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby... 
PAM: No, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Twenty years. 
PAM: No, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Thirty. 
PAM: Sure. 
MICHAEL: It's a deal. 
RYAN: All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms. 
MICHAEL: Yesh. 
RYAN: Uh, fun jeans. 
MICHAEL: Right there. Ah. 
ANGELA: Sign. 
MICHAEL: Per diem. 
MICHAEL: Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo. 
DWIGHT: Don't be mad, it is a business trip. 
ANGELA: But I don't understand. It's for managers. 
DWIGHT: Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager. 
ANGELA: I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together.  Are you still there? 
DWIGHT: Yes, Monkey. 
ANGELA: Don't "Monkey" me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M. 
ANGELA: In the Martin family, we like to say, "Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly." That's code for "check out the slut." What is... why are there flies in here? 
KELLY: Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing? 
PAM: This. 
KELLY: You look so pretty. 
PAM: Thank you. 
PAM: Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that. 
KELLY: Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power. 
MICHAEL: Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom? 
KELLY: My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight. 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker. 
DWIGHT: And your veil. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, do it! 
PAM: I'll probably just wear this. 
MICHAEL: Really? Okay. Well, word of 
ADVICE: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim? 
PAM: Um... 
MICHAEL: Um. Okay, um. 
DWIGHT: Um. 
MICHAEL: You got that? 
DWIGHT: I got it. 
MICHAEL: Write it down. 
DWIGHT: I got it. 
DWIGHT: Um. 
MICHAEL: Um. Dwight and 
MICHAEL:  Um, um, um... 
CREED: There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train? 
ANGELA: That was for per diem, for Philadelphia. 
MEREDITH: That town smells like cheese steaks. 
ANGELA: That town is full of history! 
CREED: Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her.  Creed. 
DWIGHT: Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back? 
JOSH: Hey, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hey, Josh, how ya doing? 
JOSH: Pretty good. 
MICHAEL: Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns. 
MICHAEL: I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut. 
JIM: It's really good to see you, man. 
MICHAEL: Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too! 
DWIGHT: Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet? 
JIM: Yeah, sold about forty thousand. 
MICHAEL: Hey! 
DWIGHT: Shut up. That's impossible. 
JIM: No, it's not. I did. Yep. 
DWIGHT: Well, I did it too. 
JIM: You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key. 
KEVIN: So did you hear? 
TOBY: What? 
KEVIN: Pam's back on the market again. 
TOBY: Really? She's dating? 
KEVIN: If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that. 
DWIGHT: So what kind of commissions you get up there? 
JIM: Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much. 
DWIGHT: You're so immature! 
JOSH: Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman. 
MICHAEL: Ah. 
JOSH: And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford. 
JAN: Oh, hey! 
DWIGHT: Hey, Jan. 
JAN: We all checked in? 
JOSH: Yes. 
JAN: Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour. 
JOSH: Okay. 
JAN: Okay! 
MICHAEL: Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules. 
JAN: What are you talking about? 
MICHAEL: The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention. 
JAN: Step away from me, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you. 
KELLY: Alan's cartoon is so funny, right? 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
KELLY: And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time. 
DWIGHT: This party is going to be awesome. 
MICHAEL: I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic. 
DWIGHT: Check it out. 
MICHAEL: That is crooked on that side. 
DWIGHT: Wow. 
MICHAEL: Hey hey! 
JIM: That is a lot of liquor. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
JIM: And a dart board. 
MICHAEL: Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop. 
JOSH: We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan. 
MICHAEL: Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen? 
JOSH: A shot of MIDORI, perhaps. 
JIM: Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there. 
MICHAEL: Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday. 
JOSH: Um, we should... 
JIM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up. 
DWIGHT: I'll do a shot, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet. 
MICHAEL: SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG. 
MICHAEL: Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin. 
DWIGHT: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin. Jerome 
BETTIS: All right. 
DWIGHT: I'm a huge fan. Jerome 
BETTIS: Thanks. I appreciate it, guys. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come. Jerome 
BETTIS: All right, maybe. If I can. 
MICHAEL: Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there? Jerome 
BETTIS: No, you cannot. 
MICHAEL: So maybe. See ya. 
DWIGHT: Why do they call him The Bus? 
MICHAEL: Because he's afraid to fly. 
DWIGHT: Smile! 
MICHAEL: Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there! 
JOSH: All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front. 
MICHAEL: Yep. Yeah, she's up front. 
DWIGHT: You don't have email on your phone. 
MICHAEL: I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello? 
DWIGHT: No one just called you. 
JOSH: All right. 
JIM: All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care. 
TED: I'll see you soon. 
JOSH: Yeah, stop by later. 
MICHAEL:  See you in a bit. Bye-bye.  May I have a moment of your time please? 
MICHAEL: I need you to do something for me. 
DWIGHT: Yes. Anything. 
MICHAEL: I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic. 
DWIGHT: I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat. 
TOBY: Hey, Pam. 
PAM: Hey! What's up? 
TOBY: It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted... 
PAM:  Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too.  Sorry. What's up? 
TOBY: Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird. 
PAM: Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here. 
TOBY: Okay. 
DWIGHT: So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera. 
MICHAEL: And? 
DWIGHT: He wasn't volunteering today. 
MICHAEL: Business has been pretty crazy around the office. 
JIM: Oh yeah? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk. 
JIM: Oh, tell him I say hi. 
MICHAEL: I will call him later with that message. 
JIM: Hey, how is... Toby? 
MICHAEL: Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left? 
JIM: Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to... 
MICHAEL: Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically. 
JIM: Michael, it's really not a competition. 
JOSH: Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow. 
JAN: Great! 
MICHAEL: Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip. 
DWIGHT: Whoa. Michael. 
WAITER: Wow, oh my God, thank you. 
MICHAEL: You're welcome. 
DWIGHT: Was that your per diem? 
MICHAEL: No, that was a different hundred dollar bill. 
JAN: What have you generated, Michael? 
MICHAEL: I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening. 
JAN: What party? 
MICHAEL: The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited. 
JAN: Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7. 
PHYLLIS: You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it. 
STANLEY: If you do that, you're going to have to put out. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out. 
ANGELA: Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Any messages for 308? All right. 
MICHAEL: Hey hey, fellers. 
JIM: Michael. 
DWIGHT: Hey, Michael. 
MICHAEL: What's up? 
JOSH: Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now. 
MICHAEL: Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton. 
JOSH: I don't think so. 
MICHAEL: Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend. 
JOSH: Fine! All right. 
MICHAEL: Okay! Excellent. Oh... 
DWIGHT: Keep the wing flaps. 
MICHAEL: Shut it.  Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes.  Say hi to Pam! Jim, Josh, and 
DWIGHT: Hi, Pam. 
MICHAEL: Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Pam says hi.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye. 
MICHAEL: You first. 
DWIGHT: Come on. Nice try, Josh! 
MICHAEL: Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing. 
JOSH: Or what? We didn't bet anything, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Well, let's... 
JOSH: Yeah, we should go. 
MICHAEL: Come on! 
JOSH: We gotta go. 
MICHAEL: Come on! 
JOSH: Uh... we'll do it later. 
EVAN: Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line? 
MICHAEL: Fine. 
MICHAEL: Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work. 
EVAN: That is so true. Ready? 
MICHAEL: Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for. 
EVAN: Great. 
MICHAEL: Sorry, my meeting ran late. 
JAN: Really? 
MICHAEL: Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill. 
JOSH: They're exclusive with Staples. 
MICHAEL: Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products. 
DWIGHT: Yes! Ha! 
JAN: Well, Michael, I underestimated you. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me. 
JIM: Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard. 
ANGELA: D? 
JIM: Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker! 
KELLY: So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day. 
ALAN: Oh, great. 
RYAN: I don't want ketchup. 
KELLY: You love ketchup! He loves ketchup. 
PAM: So how do you come up with your cartoons? 
ALAN: Well, I just, uh... I kinda think about stuff that I see, or dream them. 
PAM: You dream in cartoons? How fun! 
MICHAEL: Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend. 
GUY: I thought there was a party in here. 
MICHAEL: This is the party. 
GUY: This is room 308? 
MICHAEL: Party central! So, what can I do you for?  All right. 
ALAN: See, this one is great, because it can work on a couple of different levels. 
PAM: Huh. 
ALAN:  Freedom fries for the table. 
PAM: Freedom fries. Yeah. 
ALAN: Yeah. I mean, people always say, like, "Don't be edgy." But I don't know any other way. Yeah, you get it. 
PAM: Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan. 
ALAN: Yeah. Next time bring some of your illustrations, I'll let you pick my brain. 
PAM: More freedom fries. 
ALAN: Yeah. 
PAM: That's great. 
ALAN: Okay. 
PAM: I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know. 
JIM: Michael. Am I the first to arrive? 
MICHAEL: People have been filtering in and out. 
JIM: Can I get a drink? 
MICHAEL: What? 
JIM: Can I get a drink? 
MICHAEL: Sure. You like Cosmos? 
JIM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy? 
JIM: Michael... 
MICHAEL: I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just... 
JIM: Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss. 
MICHAEL: I'm not better than Josh. 
JIM: Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now. 
JIM: No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice. 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her. 
JIM: Nope, that's okay. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
JIM: That's all right. 
MICHAEL: I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling. 
JIM: Yeah. Okay, maybe. 
EVAN: Are we early? 
MICHAEL: Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out. 
JIM: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Evan, this is Jim. 
JIM: How are you? 
EVAN: Hey, uh... Arnie Reisman. Michael, Jim. 
MICHAEL: Hey, Ernie, how ya doing? 
EVAN: Do you guys work together? 
JIM: No, we used to. Now we're friends. 
MICHAEL: Best friends. 
MICHAEL: Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular." But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly. 
MICHAEL: Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?  Ha, ha, ha. 
DWIGHT: Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
MICHAEL: Whoa. What are those stains? 
DWIGHT: Blood, urine, or semen. 
MICHAEL: Oh, God, I hope it's urine. 
MICHAEL:  Ahhhhhhhhh.  I'm hungry. 
MICHAEL: Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues! 
MICHAEL: Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go! 
DWIGHT:  Take a seat down there. Second from the end. 
MICHAEL: Alright, everybody here? Yes. 
PAM:  Popcorn anyone? 
MICHAEL: Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu! 
PAM:  Anyone else? Nooo. 
PAM: Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times. 
MICHAEL: Entourage! 
MICHAEL: Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week? 
KEVIN: Yes! 
DWIGHT: Why him? 
MICHAEL: Don't whine. Get the window.  
MICHAEL: Previously on Varsity Blues... 
KEVIN: Ok. Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year... 
JAN:  Hello? 
DWIGHT: Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who. 
ANGELA: I don't approve. I don't. 
JAN: Hello?  
MICHAEL:  Hi Jan! Hope you brought the Milk Duds! 
JAN: How would a movie increase productivity Michael? How on earth would it do that? 
MICHAEL: People work faster after... 
JAN: Magically? 
MICHAEL: No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie. 
JAN: No. 
ANGELA:  Kitchen. 
ANGELA: Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs. 
DWIGHT: That's not going to happen. 
ANGELA: You know she has it out for him now. 
DWIGHT: That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart! 
DWIGHT: Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms. 
ANGELA: Dwight, you should be running this office. 
DWIGHT: Michael would never let me... 
ANGELA: It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her. 
DWIGHT: I could never do that! 
ANGELA: Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired! 
ANGELA: I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair. 
JIM: At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus. 
PAM:  Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here.  
PAM: Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes. 
PAM:  Ok. 
KELLY:  I love it! 
PAM: Really? I don't know. 
KELLY: You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on. 
PAM: Not at work, I'll try it on--- 
KELLY: Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! 
PAM: ...noooo 
KELLY:  Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! 
ANDY: Why did you do that?! 
JIM: I'm just killing Germans, any way I can. 
ANDY: We're on the German team. Shoot the Brittish. 
JIM:  Wait, are we playing teams? 
KAREN:  Yeah. 
DWIGHT:  WAH! GAH!  
JAN:  Hello? 
DWIGHT: Is this Jan? 
JAN: Who is this? 
DWIGHT: This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter. 
JAN: You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other. 
DWIGHT: It's about Michael. 
JAN: What about him? 
DWIGHT:  I can't talk here. It's too sensitive. 
JAN: It's not about a surprise party is it? 
DWIGHT: No, but we should discuss that another time. 
JAN: Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back. 
DWIGHT: Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you. 
JAN: How do you know I like that store? 
DWIGHT: Many of your blouses are Claiborne's. 
JAN: How do you know that? 
DWIGHT: Part of my job. 
JAN: No it's not. It's officially not. 
DWIGHT: ...noted. 
DWIGHT:  I'm going... to the dentist. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
DWIGHT: I have to have an emergency crown put in. 
MICHAEL: Ouchy. 
DWIGHT: Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours. 
MICHAEL: Three hours, wow. Have fun.  
DWIGHT: Did you get anything good? 
JAN: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy? 
DWIGHT: I can save the branch. 
JAN: Really? 
DWIGHT: If you let me run it. 
JAN: Ok. 
DWIGHT:  "Ok" I can run it? 
JAN: What would you do differently? 
DWIGHT: Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house.  Right here. It's all for me. Thank you. 
JAN: Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers. 
DWIGHT: The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So , here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings. 
JAN:  Where is it? 
JAN:  Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hi. 
JAN: I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees. 
MICHAEL: Oh. That's nice. 
JAN: No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you. 
MICHAEL: ...what? 
JAN: Mm-hmm. 
MICHAEL: ...you were at the dentist? 
JAN: You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
MICHAEL: What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish. 
PHYLLIS:  Woooooow. 
KELLY: It's so sexy. You look so hot. 
PHYLLIS: It's really something. 
PAM:  It's too much. 
KELLY: What? 
PAM: I'm gonna return it. 
KELLY: No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel. 
ROY:  Hey. 
PAM: Hi. 
ROY: You look nice. 
PAM: Thanks. 
KELLY: Isn't that like your third soda today? 
JIM: Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  Ok, see you next week. Bye.  Again? 
KAREN: Scared? 
KAREN:  Call of Duty! 
JOSH:  Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute? 
ANDY: Now? 
JOSH: Yes now. 
ANDY: Put the game on hold everyone. 
JOSH: This is not working, ok? We are getting slaughtered out there. 
ANDY: It's the new guy.  
JIM: Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about... 
ANDY: See what I mean? 
JOSH: We just need a strategy, ok? We're going to set up a trap in the gun room. All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44? 
JIM: Um, sniper rifle? 
JOSH: SNIPE-- 
ANDY: WHAT? 
JOSH: JIM! 
ANDY: Are you playing for the other team?! 
JOSH: You don't snipe in Carrington, ok? 
ANDY: Saboteur! 
JOSH: Andy, it's not--- 
ANDY: Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. 
MICHAEL: Hey Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Do you want an M&M? 
DWIGHT: No thanks I'm stuffed. 
MICHAEL: No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good. 
DWIGHT: ...ok.  
MICHAEL: They're good, huh? 
DWIGHT: ...so good. 
MICHAEL: Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in. 
DWIGHT: They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so... 
MICHAEL: Sounds like a good dentist. 
DWIGHT: Oh, yeah. 
MICHAEL: What's his name? 
DWIGHT:  Crentist. 
MICHAEL: Your dentist's name is Crentist. 
DWIGHT: Yep. 
MICHAEL: Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist. 
DWIGHT: Maybe that's why he became a dentist. 
MICHAEL: Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em. 
DWIGHT:  Ahh. Aaaah. 
MICHAEL: You should... floss. 
DWIGHT: I know... 
MICHAEL:  Well then... I am glad you're ok. 
MICHAEL: Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, can I talk to you for a second? 
MICHAEL:  Wow, this is tough. 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: Ohhhh. Arrrgggh! 
DWIGHT: What is it? 
MICHAEL: Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me. 
DWIGHT: No. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job! 
DWIGHT: Gahh! 
MICHAEL: And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. 
DWIGHT: I can't believe this news. That--- wow. 
MICHAEL: I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally. 
DWIGHT: You said that? 
MICHAEL: Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it. 
DWIGHT: Well... Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will. 
MICHAEL:  Perfect, well, we're settled. 
DWIGHT: All right. 
MICHAEL: All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager. 
DWIGHT: Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it. 
MICHAEL: Ohh.. 
DWIGHT: Hey... I can't imagine this place without you. 
MICHAEL:  Can't you? That's so nice. 
MICHAEL: Well... I guess we should go tell the troops. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.  Ok let's do it. 
MICHAEL: Hey, hi, hello. Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight. 
PHYLLIS: You're kidding... 
MICHAEL: You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that. 
ANGELA: Congratulations Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Thank you Angela. 
STANLEY: But... why Dwight? 
MICHAEL: Because, Dwight... never lies. 
STANLEY: How does that qualify him to run a branch? 
MICHAEL: Because that's all it takes. 
MICHAEL: Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty? 
DWIGHT: Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity! 
PHYLLIS: Michael, what will you do? 
MICHAEL: Oh, I'll be fine. 
KEVIN: Do you have any savings? 
MICHAEL: No, no, I don't, but--- 
KEVIN: Michael, you might lose your condo. 
MICHAEL: I... won't. I won't. 
PAM: I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. 
PHYLLIS: Maybe I'll quit. 
ANGELA: It's really happening! 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
ANGELA: We can make a difference here. 
DWIGHT: I, will, make a difference here. 
ANGELA: You alone? Because I thought together we could--- 
DWIGHT: Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women. 
KAREN:  Look how cute he is! He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade. 
JIM: I'm sorry what are you whispering about? 
KAREN: I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around. 
JIM: I'm trying--- 
KAREN: Just tap S then D. 
JIM: Oh. 
KAREN:  Any... last words? No? 
JIM: What?  
JIM: Wow. Psychopath.  
PAM: What? 
CREED: I'm just looking. 
PAM: Please go back to your desk. 
CREED: In a minute. 
PAM: Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas. 
MICHAEL: Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring. 
DWIGHT:  No thank you. 
MICHAEL: It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it. 
DWIGHT: No thanks. 
MICHAEL: What? 
DWIGHT: Not my style. 
MICHAEL: But you said you liked it. You've always admired it. 
DWIGHT: Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate. 
MICHAEL:  Take it back. 
DWIGHT:  No. 
MICHAEL: That's my car. 
DWIGHT: What did you--- 
MICHAEL: THAT'S MY CAR. 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
MICHAEL: I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know. 
DWIGHT: You know what? 
MICHAEL: Jan called me about your little meeting! 
DWIGHT: No! 
MICHAEL: I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD. 
MICHAEL: Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight? 
DWIGHT:  Don't fire me. Please. 
MICHAEL: Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?! 
DWIGHT:  I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS! 
MICHAEL: Not. Good. Enough! 
DWIGHT:  I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year! 
MICHAEL: I have a laundry machine! 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear.  
MICHAEL: I don't know if I can trust you anymore. 
DWIGHT: You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do?  What can I do?  What can I do? What can I do? 
MICHAEL: You can get up. Get up.  And you can hug it out, bitch.  
MICHAEL: Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate. 
JIM:  
KAREN:  
MICHAEL: Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I'm making him do my laundry for a year. 
MICHAEL: Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse? 
RYAN: Uh, no thanks, I'm good. 
MICHAEL: Oh, it's okay, I'm going down. 
RYAN: Um... Yeah, absolutely. 
MICHAEL: All right, I'll be right back.  
DWIGHT:  Whoo! 
MICHAEL:  There you go. 
DWIGHT: Awesome! 
RYAN: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: You're welcome. 
DWIGHT: Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse? 
MICHAEL: Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute.  
DWIGHT: Okay.  Whoo! 
MICHAEL: There you go, fresh from the warehouse. 
PAM: Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse? 
MICHAEL: There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam. 
PAM: But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better. Ryan and 
OTHERS: Yeah. Yes, it's better. It's great. 
MICHAEL:  All right. Okay.  
MICHAEL: I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained. 
PAM:  With cream and sugar? 
MICHAEL:  All right. 
JAN:  So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck. 
MICHAEL: Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me? 
JAN: Michael, Ed died over the weekend. 
MICHAEL: Oh, wow. 
MICHAEL: Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died. 
KELLY: Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news! You must feel so sad. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss. 
PHYLLIS: That's a shame. Ed was a good guy. 
MICHAEL: That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up. 
MICHAEL: So did you hear the news? 
PAM: The news that you just announced? That Ed died? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
PAM: Is there anything I can do? 
MICHAEL: Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life. 
PAM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL:  
PAM: Oh. Okay. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Mmmmmm. 
PAM:  Okay. 
JOSH: What's going on with Fairfield County schools? Karen, did you generate that price list? 
KAREN: Um, shoot. Uh, I will. Sorry. 
JOSH: Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure? 
JIM: Oh yeah, definitely. 
ANDY:  Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said? 
JOSH: Thank you, everyone. 
KAREN:  Dammit. 
JIM: What's up? 
KAREN: Uh, nothing. They're just out of Herr's chips. 
JIM: Oh. 
KAREN: But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority. 
JIM: Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please. 
CREED: It's a real shame about Ed, huh? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'. 
CREED: About what? 
MICHAEL: The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that. 
CREED: Ed was decapitated. 
MICHAEL: What? 
DWIGHT: Really? 
CREED: He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off. 
MICHAEL: Oh my God. 
DWIGHT: That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart. 
CREED: You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated. 
DWIGHT: You're thinking of a chicken. 
CREED: What did I say? 
MICHAEL: That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him. 
MICHAEL:  So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this... 
DWIGHT: Ed was decapitated. 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
DWIGHT: You said you didn't know how to say it. 
MICHAEL: I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out. 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
ANGELA: Hi. 
DWIGHT: If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice. 
ANGELA: I do not wanna talk about this. 
DWIGHT: When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here. 
JAN:  I understand how you feel, Michael. I really do. So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off? 
MICHAEL: You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off. 
JAN: Well, what would you suggest? 
MICHAEL:  A statue. 
JAN: Of Ed? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
JAN:  I'm not sure that's realistic. 
MICHAEL: Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him. 
JAN: No, that's not--- 
MICHAEL: We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move... 
DWIGHT: That is not a statue, that is a robot. 
MICHAEL: I think that is a great way to honor Ed. 
DWIGHT: And how big do you want this robot? 
MICHAEL: Life-size. 
DWIGHT: Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us. 
JAN: What the hell are you two talking about? 
MICHAEL: Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan. 
JAN: You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today... 
MICHAEL: Mm hm. 
JAN: ...and I have to get back to work. 
MICHAEL: Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck. 
JAN: So call me when you feel like having a real conversation. 
MICHAEL: But Ed truck can't because he is--- 
JAN: Goodbye.  
MICHAEL: DEAD. 
DWIGHT: Look  I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us. 
MICHAEL: That's perfect. 
JIM: Okay, that is a "no" on the on the West Side Market. 
KAREN: Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now? 
JIM: Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter. 
KAREN: I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want. 
JIM: Really? 
KAREN: Yeah, all day. 
ANDY: Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in. 
JIM: Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen. 
ANDY: Did you check the vending machine? 
KAREN: Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that? 
JIM: I have no idea. We went right for the copier. 
KAREN: Mm. 
JIM: And then we checked the fax machine. 
KAREN: Yeah, nothing there. 
ANDY: Did you check your... butt? 
MICHAEL: Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam. 
PHYLLIS: Okay that's enough. 
MICHAEL: What? 
STANLEY: We do not wanna hear about this. 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head! 
STANLEY: You have just spit on my face. 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work! 
MICHAEL: There are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job. 
MICHAEL: I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone. 
ROY: Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car. 
MICHAEL: Okay, fine. Hurry back. 
ROY:  There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the "grief counseling" session. 
PAM: Oh. I would like a break. 
ROY: How are you likin' the new car? 
PAM: Great. 
ROY: Yeah? Sure is small. Got airbags? 
PAM: I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders. 
ROY:  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah. 
JIM:  Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back.  Shut up . 
KAREN:  Six? 
MICHAEL:  Okay, we can start. Um... 
PAM: You waited for me? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot? 
DWIGHT:  I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby. 
MICHAEL: Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else. 
STANLEY:  Nope. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go. 
STANLEY: I will NOT.  
MICHAEL: Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam. 
PAM: Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die. 
MICHAEL: Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay. 
RYAN:  Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened. 
MICHAEL: Do you want to talk about it anymore? 
RYAN: Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story. 
KEVIN: Me, me, me, me, me me.  Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so... 
MICHAEL: Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's.  Do you think that this is a game? 
PHYLLIS: Well, there is a ball. 
MICHAEL: All right, we're starting over. 
STANLEY: No, I'm done. 
MICHAEL: You are not leaving. No! We are not done. 
ANGELA: We really have a lot of work to do right now. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk.  
TOBY: Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going. 
MICHAEL: How do you know? 
TOBY: What? 
MICHAEL: That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing? 
TOBY: It was obvious... 
MICHAEL: Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING!  
DWIGHT: Michael!  Michael. Michael ... 
MICHAEL:  Oh, God! 
DWIGHT:  Oh... 
MICHAEL: Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ... 
DWIGHT: Poor little fella. 
MICHAEL: Oh shhhh--oot! 
DWIGHT: He is a goner. 
MICHAEL: No, he's not. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: No, he's not.  
DWIGHT: Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria! 
MICHAEL: Well, you can't get diseases from a bird! 
ANGELA: A dead bird should not be in the kitchen! 
MICHAEL: We don't know if it's dead. 
KELLY: Ugh, no that thing is dead. 
DWIGHT: You want me to flush him? 
MICHAEL: Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird. 
MEREDITH: I have a lot of work to do. 
MICHAEL: Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it. 
ANGELA: But... 
MICHAEL: No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him. 
KAREN: I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal. 
JIM: Nice! 
KAREN:  Bonjour. Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's. Non? Ah... merci quand meme. Au revoir. 
JIM: Sounded good. 
KAREN: Thanks. 
KELLY:  
MICHAEL: It's okay. It's okay.  Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show. 
KELLY: I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan  for him to know that we have a date tonight? 
DWIGHT:  Argh... gah! 
MICHAEL: What are... What are you doing? 
DWIGHT: What? No, this is about the right size. 
MICHAEL: No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!? 
DWIGHT: I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum.  It would have fit if he had given me another minute. 
DWIGHT: I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining. 
PAM: Is it for the bird? 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
PAM: I have it covered.  
DWIGHT: Oh, thank you. 
PAM: If you wanna do something for the funeral... 
DWIGHT: Yes, please. 
PAM: Maybe you could play a song on your recorder. 
DWIGHT: Excellent. 
PAM: Do you have it with you? 
DWIGHT: Always.  
PAM: Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into. 
KAREN:  Where'd you find them? 
JIM: Where'd I find what? 
JIM: I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door. 
MICHAEL: Glad you could all make it. 
KELLY: You told us we had to. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, do you have the box? 
PAM: Actually, I have it. 
MICHAEL: You made this? Wow.  That's... that's very nice. 
RYAN: When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking "I'm a little too old for this." And I was five. 
PAM: I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
PAM: What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much. It's just a bird." But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above. 
KEVIN: Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny. 
PAM: And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song. 
DWIGHT: He's not a songbird. 
MICHAEL: Shhh. 
PAM: An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten. 
ANGELA:  Amen. 
DWIGHT:  
PAM:  Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ... 
MICHAEL: Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown. 
DWIGHT: Let's get back to work. 
DWIGHT: Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they? 
RYAN: A dime and a nickel. 
DWIGHT: No, I said one of them is not a nickel. 
RYAN: But the other one is. I've heard that before. 
DWIGHT: Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ... 
RYAN: Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother. 
DWIGHT: A man is found hanging from the ceiling... 
RYAN: He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted. 
DWIGHT: A hunter. 
RYAN: It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole. 
DWIGHT: Damn it! 
JAN: Tell me what you did yesterday. 
MICHAEL: Uhhh... nothing. 
JAN: Nothing? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, nothing. How was your day? 
JAN: I don't care how your day was Michael. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that? 
JAN: Tell me what you did yesterday. 
MICHAEL: I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear? 
MICHAEL: Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base. 
JAN: Hi, Pam. 
PAM: Hi. 
JAN: I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok? 
PAM: Oh, I don't know if I'm... 
JAN: Thanks Pam. 
PAM: It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five. 
DWIGHT: So you excited? 
RYAN: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Very excited? 
RYAN: Yes. I'm very excited. 
DWIGHT: Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool. 
RYAN: I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited. 
DWIGHT: I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions? 
RYAN: So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions?  So where's the sales office? 
DWIGHT: When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now. 
KAREN:  Hey. 
JIM: What? 
KAREN: My chair is squeaking. 
JIM: Is it? 
KAREN: You took my chair. 
JIM: No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair. 
KAREN: When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so... 
JIM: So I guess I can't get up. 
MICHAEL: Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too. 
DWIGHT: Do you know where we are, temp? 
RYAN: I know where we're not. 
DWIGHT: I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it.  AH!  When... Damn it. 
ANDY: Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second. 
JIM: Sure. 
ANDY: Can you stand up? And talk to me over there? 
KAREN: That's it? That's what you came up with? 
ANDY: I'm acting my heart out here. 
KAREN: Really? 
ANDY: Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped. 
ANNOUNCER: Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o'clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants. 
PAM: Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is. 
MICHAEL: Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, shhh... Come on. 
DWIGHT: And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you. 
RYAN: I don't think you know what you're saying. 
DWIGHT: Smells pretty bad, doesn't it? 
RYAN: Uh huh. 
DWIGHT: It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away. 
RYAN: Gotcha. 
DWIGHT: Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back. 
RYAN: Ok.  Of course. 
STANLEY: I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day. 
KELLY: Because they acted all tough and everything... 
MICHAEL: Uh huh. 
KELLY: But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to... 
MICHAEL:  Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing? 
PHYLLIS: I'm just saying hi to Bob. 
MICHAEL: No, I think you're cutting in line. 
BOB: Well settle down, Scott. 
MICHAEL: No, I'm not going to settle down. 
STANLEY: No way. 
MICHAEL: Get in the back please. 
STANLEY: Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line. 
MICHAEL: Boooooo. Thank you. . That's right. 
BOB: What a pair of Mary's. 
STANLEY: This is Pretzel Day. 
RYAN: Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship. 
DWIGHT: Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm. 
KAREN:  
JIM:  Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me, 
KAREN: stop. 
JIM: Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me 
KAREN: This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please. 
JIM: fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me, 
KAREN: This is not a proportionate response. 
JIM: Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. 
ANDY: I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys? 
PAM: Michael. 
MICHAEL: No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind. 
PAM: Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks. 
MICHAEL: I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel. 
PAM: Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel. 
MICHAEL: Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown. 
PAM: You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today. 
MICHAEL: Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back. 
DWIGHT: It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness. 
RYAN: Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it. 
DWIGHT: You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test? 
RYAN: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Come on! 
STANLEY: Thank you!  
MICHAEL: Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left. Pretzel 
GUY: We do. 
MICHAEL: Thank God. Pretzel 
GUY: And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&M's, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallow, nuts, toffee nuts, coconuts, peanut butter drizzle, Oreos, sprinkles, cotton candy bits, and powdered sugar. 
MICHAEL: Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them? Pretzel 
GUY: The Works. You got it. 
MICHAEL: All right! Thank you! 
DWIGHT: Please be seated.  
RYAN: Who was that? 
DWIGHT: Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground. 
RYAN: Is that your Cousin Mose? 
DWIGHT: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore. 
DWIGHT: What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin? 
RYAN: Outsourcing and consolidation of competition. 
DWIGHT: Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide? 
RYAN: Depression? 
DWIGHT: Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative? 
KELLY: I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be? 
ANGELA: Sales take a long time. 
KELLY: Oh my God, I'm so worried. 
ANGELA: I'm sure Dwight will protect him. 
KELLY: I don't know. Dwight's so weird. 
ANGELA: He's not weird, he's just individualistic. 
KELLY: No, he's a freak. 
ANGELA: You're a freak! 
DWIGHT: Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear? 
RYAN: Um, loneliness. Maybe women. 
DWIGHT: Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose. 
RYAN: No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK. 
DWIGHT: Wrestle him to the ground. 
RYAN: No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye. 
DWIGHT: Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan? Cousin 
MOSE: Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice. 
DWIGHT: Where are all the animals? 
DWIGHT: Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled. 
DWIGHT: You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams. 
RYAN: Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call. 
DWIGHT: Screwgun. The sales call! 
KEVIN:  Hey! Hey! 
MICHAEL: Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal? 
DWIGHT: Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much. 
RYAN: Wait, can you go back? 
DWIGHT: Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time. 
RYAN: Ok, I'm going to establish time frames. 
DWIGHT: Good. 
RYAN: I'm going to put everything in terms of "real dollars". 
DWIGHT: Right. 
RYAN: I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers. 
DWIGHT: Uh huh. 
RYAN: Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing. 
DWIGHT: Exactly. Yes. 
RYAN: I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky. 
MICHAEL: Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second... 
TOBY: Second? 
MICHAEL: Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you. 
KEVIN: Account...? Michael, what is going on? 
MICHAEL: And I will be taking questions. 
PAM: Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael? 
PHYLLIS: What's on your suit? 
MICHAEL: Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much! 
RYAN: They really didn't like me. 
DWIGHT: They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face. 
RYAN: I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong. 
DWIGHT: Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing?  Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive. 
RYAN: You drive. 
PAM: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan. 
DWIGHT:  Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere. 
RYAN: I think about that all the time. 
KEVIN: Night, Pam. 
PAM: Night. 
MICHAEL: Hey, what time is it? 
PAM: 20 past 5. 
MICHAEL: AM or PM? 
PAM: PM. 
MICHAEL: Oh, good. 
PAM: These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli? 
MICHAEL: Oh. Koselli. With the Jello. 
PAM: This is a huge sale. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Right. Good. 
PAM: Night, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Goodnight! 
PAM:  Dunder Mifflin. 
JIM: Ah, hey. 
PAM: Oh my God. 
JIM: Hi. 
PAM: Hi. 
JIM: Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing. 
PAM: Oh. 
JIM: And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there? 
PAM: I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day. 
JIM: Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that? 
PAM: Yeah, totally. So... 
JIM: So... 
PAM: Do you... 
JIM: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
PAM: Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here. 
JIM: Oh, good. 
PAM: A little different. What time is it there? 
JIM: What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone. 
PAM: Oh, yeah. Right. 
JIM: How far away did you think we were? 
PAM: I don't know. It felt far. 
JIM: Yeah. I have a question for you. 
PAM: What? 
JIM: How many words per minute does the average person type? 
PAM: I type 90. 
JIM: Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90. 
PAM: It's true. 
JIM: Ok, I said average. 
PAM: 70? How many do you type? 
JIM: Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it. 
PAM: Come on. Tell me. 
JIM: No. 
PAM: You have to tell me now. 
JIM: 65. Ok, no need to laugh. 
PAM: No, it's, that's respectable. 
JIM: Respectable? 
PAM: So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself... 
JIM: Right. 
PAM: Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home... 
JIM: Ok. 
PAM: And, I'm freaking out. 
JIM: Yeah. 
PAM: That movie is so scary! 
JIM: I know! 
PAM: But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up. 
JIM: No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later? 
PAM: Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box. 
JIM: No, you're making this up! 
PAM: Would I make that up? 
JIM: Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet. 
JIM: And how many kitchens? 
PAM: I have one kitchen. 
JIM: Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley. 
PAM: It's actually... 
JIM: Most apartments these days have like three. 
PAM: Three kitchens? 
JIM: Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen? 
PAM:  Hey, Ryan, are you ok? 
JIM: Pam? 
RYAN: Yeah. Yeah. 
JIM: Pam? 
PAM: Um. Ok, bye. 
JIM: Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too. 
PAM: No, I was um... 
JIM: Oh, no no. 
PAM: You have to go? 
JIM: Yeah, uh, well. 
PAM: No, I should probably go too. 
JIM: Ok. 
PAM: I mean, yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. Bye Pam. 
PAM: Bye Jim. 
STANLEY: Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day. 
KELLY: Here you go. 
MICHAEL: Nice dress, Ryan. 
KELLY: It's not a dress. It's a kurta. 
MICHAEL:  OK. 
MICHAEL: Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it  it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great.  Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween. 
KELLY: You look so handsome. 
PAM: Really you do. I love the material. 
KELLY: I know. 
MICHAEL: How come you didn't get me one? 
KELLY: I... 
PHYLLIS: Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people. 
PAM: I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired. 
MEREDITH: Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place? 
PAM: Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet. 
KELLY: I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends. 
PAM: I just feel kind of tired, you know. 
DWIGHT: Maybe you've got mono. 
PAM: Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with. 
KELLY: Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available. 
KEVIN: Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight? 
ROY: I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going? 
KEVIN: Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going? 
ANGELA: Don't go. They eat monkey brains. 
MICHAEL: Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional. 
MICHAEL: It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby. 
STANLEY: I don't celebrate Kwanzaa. 
MICHAEL: Wha? Really? You should! It's fun. 
MICHAEL: I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol. 
MICHAEL: Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on. 
KELLY: Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um... 
MICHAEL: Kelly? 
KELLY: Sparkles... 
MICHAEL: Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday. 
KELLY: Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think. 
ANGELA: How many gods do you have? 
KELLY: Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that. 
ANGELA:  And that blue busty gal? What's her story? 
KEVIN: She looks like Pam from the neck down. 
DWIGHT: Pam wishes.  Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil... 
MICHAEL: All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'. 
JIM: Sorry. 
JIM: I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work. 
KAREN: Nice basket. 
JIM: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians.  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... ' 
DWIGHT: I see dead people. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Spoiler... alert. 
DWIGHT: He was dead the whole time. 
MICHAEL: Just stop it.  What's the... oh, whoa!  Where did that come from? 
TONY: Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms. 
KAREN: Oh. Did you shake it? 
TONY: Yeah, I shook it, I shook it. 
ANDY: We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I. 
JIM: 'Scuse me? 
ANDY: Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane. 
JIM: Wow. 
ANDY: From 'Cheers'. 
JIM: Yup. 
MICHAEL: And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before? 
CREED: I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'. 
MEREDITH: Oh, that's what they call it. 
KEVIN: This is the best meeting we've ever had. 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Kevin. 
ANGELA: I find this incredibly offensive. 
MICHAEL: Well, I find it beautiful. 
ANGELA: Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it. 
MICHAEL: No... 
TOBY: Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these. 
MICHAEL: No, You're not going to collect them. 
TOBY: Yes. 
MICHAEL: No. This is delightful, charming culture. 
MICHAEL: My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight. 
JOSH: All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner. 
KAREN: Thanks. 
JOSH: And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time. 
KAREN: Got it. 
JIM: Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds. 
ANDY: You guys ready to party? 
JIM: What's that? 
ANDY: I said are you ready TO PARTY! 
PHYLLIS: Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes? 
ANGELA: I wish some of us still had our shoes on. 
KEVIN: Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you. 
CAROL:  I thought you said this was a costume party! 
MICHAEL:  What does that look like to you? 
CAROL: An Indian woman in a sari. 
MICHAEL: No one's even going to notice. 
KEVIN: Nice outfit. 
MICHAEL: Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol. 
MICHAEL: I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions... 
ANGELA: I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat? 
SERVER: It's all vegetarian. 
ANGELA: I'll just have some bread. You used your hands. 
MICHAEL: Oh, yuck.  
CAROL: What? Too spicy? 
MICHAEL: No. These s'mores are disgusting. 
CAROL: They're not s'mores. They're samosas. 
MICHAEL: Do you think they have any s'mores? 
MICHAEL: All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been? 
RYAN: So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh? 
GIRLS:  Kelly Zach Braff  
RYAN: What? 
KELLY: Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys. 
RYAN: They said something about Zach Braff. 
KELLY: Don't even listen to them. They're so... 
RYAN: No, you don't... 
PAM: Very official. 
PAM: I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean? 
DWIGHT: Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut! 
KELLY: I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at! Kelly's 
MOM: Stop it right now. Ryan is a temporary worker, makes no money. Wally is a whole doctor. So handsome. 
KELLY: Uh... excuse me. I want to get a... Kelly's 
MOM: He's a perfect match. 
ANDY: Hey, Big Tuna, you ready? 
JIM: Yep. 
ANDY: One. Two. Three. Shot! 
JIM: Oh, Holy Mother of God. 
ANDY: Oh, that burns! Golly. Um... 
JIM: Good. 
KAREN: Ooh. 
OVERHEAD:  Looking so crazy, my baby. I'm not myself lately. I'm foolish. I don't do this. I've been playing myself. Baby I don't care. Cuz your love got the best of me. And baby you're making a fool of me. 
MICHAEL: Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night? Kelly's 
FATHER: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Kelly's 
FATHER: How long have you been married to the cheerleader? 
MICHAEL: Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet! Kelly's 
MOM: She is very fair. 
MICHAEL: She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks! 
ANDY: One. Two. Three. Shot! 
JIM: Oh. 
CAROL: Are you okay? 
MICHAEL: I'm going to be.  Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.  Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband. 
CROWD: Awww! 
CAROL: Oh, Michael. 
MICHAEL: What do you say? 
CAROL: Can we talk about this in private? 
MICHAEL: I didn't hear you.  
CAROL:  Can we talk about this in private? 
MICHAEL:  Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay. 
MICHAEL: No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic... 
CAROL: This is the ninth date, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much. 
CAROL: I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
CAROL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Okay. Good night.  Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra. 
CAROL: Okay, good night, Michael. 
MICHAEL: All right. Good night. 
RYAN: Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive. Kelly's 
MOM: So you're saving money... 
RYAN: Yes. Kelly's 
MOM: ...to start a family and home. 
RYAN: Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox. Kelly's 
FATHER: Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight? 
PAM: Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael. Young 
MAN: Is it? He's really outgoing, huh? 
PAM: Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second? 
PAM: It's hot in there. How's the naan? 
ANGELA: Dry. You look like you were having fun. 
PAM: I am. You should come dance with us. 
ANGELA: I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting? 
PAM: No one. 
ANDY:  I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children... 
KAREN: Andy, no acappella. 
ANDY:  I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain. Andy and 
JIM:  There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line 
ANDY: Wait, wait. Andy and 
JIM:  the less I seek my source... 
KAREN: Oh, come on, guys. Please. Andy and 
JIM:  the closer I am to fi-i-i-ne. The closer I am to.. 
KAREN: It's not good. Andy and 
JIM:  fi-i-i-ine! 
ANDY: TUNA! Are you kidding me!! 
MICHAEL: Oh, God!  Oh. Wow. 
PAM: Here.  
MICHAEL: That's so spicy. 
PAM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Oh. You waiting for a call? 
PAM: Uh... no. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements. 
PAM: Well, you were never really engaged. 
MICHAEL: I was in that marriage arena, though. 
PAM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Uuuuh... well. 
PAM: I kind of thought something would happen tonight too. 
MICHAEL: We're so alike. So alike.  
PAM: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
PAM: I'm rejecting your... 
MICHAEL: I'm... what? I didn't 
PAM: ...kiss. 
MICHAEL:  Can I have a ride home? 
PAM: If you sit in the back. 
KAREN: Goodnight, guys. 
JIM: Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike. 
ANDY: No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin. 
JIM: Okay. 
JIM: Oh. 
KAREN: Hey dummy, get in the car! 
JIM: I'm a drunk driver. 
KAREN: Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car. 
JIM: Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli. 
KAREN: Yeah, you can't. 
JIM: No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right. 
KAREN: Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay? 
JIM: So good. 
KAREN: Good. 
MICHAEL: These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'. 
PAM: You say one more word; I'm stopping the car. 
MICHAEL: Sorry. 
MICHAEL: This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler.  Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali! 
CROWD:  
KAREN: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
KAREN: Who are you faxing so early in the morning? 
JIM: Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain. 
JIM: I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future.  "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight." 
DWIGHT: No! You'll thank me later. 
MICHAEL: There she is - Jan Levinson. First... 
JAN: Michael. 
MICHAEL: ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan. 
JAN: Michael. 
MICHAEL:  Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby. 
JAN: Michael. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
JAN: I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. 
JAN: The board voted last night to close your branch. 
MICHAEL: On whom's authority? 
JAN: The board's. 
MICHAEL: What? 
JAN: I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service. 
MICHAEL: You're welcome. 
JAN: A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages. 
MICHAEL: Am I a small number person or a severance package person? 
JAN: Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person. 
MICHAEL: Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up. 
JAN: Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Well... 
JAN: It's... it's about talent. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you gotta be... Josh? 
JAN: Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future. 
MICHAEL: Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe? 
MICHAEL: It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm. 
MICHAEL: Pictures. Memories.  Look at that. They grow up so fast. 
DWIGHT: Hey stranger. 
MICHAEL: Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please. 
DWIGHT: Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile. 
MICHAEL: Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can. Dwight 
: When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, "Something Weird is Going On." Colon, "What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute." 
KAREN: Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is...  
JIM: Really? Wow... that's bad. 
ANDY: Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing?  In your face! 
JIM: Well, I work here now. 
ANDY: Mmmm.. suck-ah! 
PAM: Are you okay? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life. 
PAM: What did Jan want? 
MICHAEL: Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so... 
PAM: What can't you tell me? 
MICHAEL: Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway. 
PAM: What?! 
MICHAEL: What? 
PAM: You just said that we're gonna be gone...? 
MICHAEL: Do I have any messages? 
PAM: Michael, what's going on? 
MICHAEL: Ok, ok... 
MICHAEL:  Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down. 
TOBY: Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made. 
MICHAEL: You knew about this all along, didn't you? 
TOBY: Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you. 
MICHAEL: Traitor. You are a traitor. 
ANGELA: What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst. 
RYAN: It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail.  A thousand business cards with this address and phone number. 
ANGELA: I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame. 
KELLY: If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one. 
ANDY:  Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut! 
JIM: I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans. 
STANLEY: I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel.  I really couldn't be happier. 
PAM: It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam." So, maybe that'll stop now. 
ROY: What does that mean? 
KEVIN: Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut. 
ROY: I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, "You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)"? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words. 
DARRYL: Hey Mike. 
MICHAEL: Darryl. Noble Darryl.  
DARRYL: Look, I heard about the office. Tough break. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me. 
DARRYL: I wasn't. 
MICHAEL: So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and... 
DARRYL: Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good. 
MICHAEL: Awesome. 
MICHAEL: This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance. 
MICHAEL: All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there.  Let's go. 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
PAM: Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup. 
DWIGHT: What's the plan? 
MICHAEL: Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch. 
DWIGHT: Can I drive? 
MICHAEL: No... way. 
DWIGHT: Shotgun! 
MICHAEL: No. There's no one else. 
DWIGHT: Still. 
DWIGHT: Thank you very much.  Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office. 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay. Um... 
DWIGHT: But, do not worry. I have his home address right  here. 
MICHAEL: Why? 
DWIGHT: Christmas card list. 
MICHAEL: You sent him cards? You never met him. 
DWIGHT: But when I do, we'll have something to talk about. 
JIM: Hey, do you have a second? 
JOSH: Sure, what's up? 
JIM: I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton? 
JOSH: I honestly don't. I don't know. 
JIM: Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants? 
JOSH: You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it. 
JIM: What does that mean? 
JAN: Hi. 
JOSH: Jan, hey. 
JAN: Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics? 
RYAN:  I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense. 
RYAN: This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best. 
MICHAEL: Okay, this is it.  This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person." It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else. 
JAN: So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two. 
JOSH: Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely. 
JAN: Awesome. 
JOSH: Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job. 
JAN: Wha... excuse... why not? 
JOSH: As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples. 
JAN: Today? 
JOSH:  
JAN: You leveraged your new position with us into another offer? 
JOSH:  
JAN: Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I... 
JOSH: I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done. 
JAN: I'm gonna make some calls. 
JIM: Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that. 
DWIGHT: So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up? 
MICHAEL: I will improvise. I will speak from the heart. 
DWIGHT: No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
DWIGHT:  Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work. M 
ICHAEL: Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace? 
DWIGHT: Yes? What is the meaning of this? Michael 
: Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work? 
DWIGHT: Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents. 
MICHAEL: Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings. 
DWIGHT: Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business. 
MICHAEL:  Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that. 
DWIGHT:  Whoa hey, why not? 
MICHAEL: Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay? 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Don't touch me this time. 
DWIGHT:  Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work... 
MICHAEL: Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? 
DWIGHT:  Uh! 
JAN: So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford. 
JIM: Wow. 
JAN: And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch. 
JIM: Thank you. 
JAN: Yeah. 
JIM: No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um... 
JAN: Michael. 
JIM: No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think. 
JAN: Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay. 
JIM: Okay. 
PHYLLIS: Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again. 
KEVIN: Where are we going? 
PHYLLIS: I thought maybe DJ's. 
KEVIN: How about Cugino's? 
ANGELA: I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore. 
KEVIN: How 'bout Cooper's then? 
ANGELA: No seafood. 
KEVIN: But, I don't want to go to DJ's. 
ANGELA: Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky? 
PHYLLIS: Okay, forget it.  
KEVIN: Hooters? 
ANGELA: No. 
DWIGHT: Ah.  Here, replinish your fluids. 
MICHAEL:  
JAN:  Where's Michael? 
PAM: He's not here. I don't know where he is. 
JAN:  Wha... what's going on here? 
PHYLLIS: We know the branch is closing; Michael told us. 
JAN: Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe. 
ANGELA: Yes! 
KEVIN: Yes!  
PHYLLIS: Stanley!  
PAM: Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something? 
JAN: Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him. 
PAM: Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton? 
JAN: Back? 
PAM: Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton? 
JAN: Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few. 
DWIGHT:  who is it? 
MICHAEL: The office. 
DWIGHT: Gonna get it? 
MICHAEL: No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news. 
PAM: I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood. 
RYAN: Is Jim coming back. 
PAM: That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh. 
RYAN: I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk. 
PAM: Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right? 
RYAN: Oh, yeah, totally. 
KELLY: Ahhhhh!  I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan!  This is the best day of my whole l ife! 
KAREN: What you gonna do? 
JIM: I really don't know. How you doing with all this? 
KAREN: You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job. 
JIM: You'd actually move to Scranton? 
KAREN: Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would. 
JIM: New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York? 
KAREN: Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that. 
JOSH: Hey Andy! 
ANDY:  What's up, Josh? 
JOSH: I just want to say thanks. Good luck. 
ANDY: Thanks, man. You, too. Totally. 
MICHAEL: Anything? 
DWIGHT: Nothing.  
MICHAEL: What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under? 
DWIGHT: Then it was an honor to have worked with you. 
MICHAEL:  All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go. 
DWIGHT: My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher. 
MICHAEL: That was hilarious. The foam ... 
DWIGHT: Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me. 
MICHAEL: Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good. 
DWIGHT: What were your favorite moments? 
MICHAEL: Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one. 
DWIGHT: What about when Jan said the branch was closing? 
MICHAEL: God, Dwight! 
DWIGHT: Well, it doesn't... 
KEVIN: Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots. 
PAM: No thanks, guys. 
KEVIN: All right. 
PAM: Have fun though. 
KEVIN: Cool. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, I hear Jim's coming back. 
PAM: Really? Where did you hear that? 
PHYLLIS: I was... 
KEVIN:  Hey Ryan, you coming? 
RYAN: Uh yeah, we'll meet you there. 
KEVIN: Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis. 
PHYLLIS:  I'll tell you later. 
PAM: Okay. 
ROY: Crazy day, huh? 
PAM: Yeah. 
ROY: Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here. 
PAM: Yeah, me too. 
PAM: Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay. 
JIM: Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it. 
KAREN: Okay, yeah. Maybe I will. 
JIM: Okay. 
KAREN: Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go. 
MICHAEL: What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car. 
DWIGHT:  
MICHAEL: Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore! 
DWIGHT:  Oh my God! 
MICHAEL: What?! 
DWIGHT:: Stranford is closed! Michael, we're not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed. 
MICHAEL: We did it? We did it. 
DWIGHT: We did it! Michael and 
DWIGHT: We did it! We did it! 
MICHAEL: Right here! Right here!  Michael and 
DWIGHT: Ouu! Ou! Ouu! Ouu! 
MICHAEL: Yeah, baby! 
DWIGHT: In your face! 
MICHAEL: We did it! 
DWIGHT: Oh, man. 
MICHAEL: How did we do it? 
DWIGHT: I don't ... have no idea. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. 
TOBY: Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65. 
JIM: The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats. 
ANDY:  That's the other thing you got to watch out...  Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott. 
JIM: Yeah. 
ANDY: So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines? 
JIM: You know what? I think you just need to meet him. 
ANDY: Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you. 
JIM: Sounds good Andy. 
KAREN: This is going to be an adventure. 
JIM: Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later? 
KAREN: Right on.  Hey is that Josh's computer? 
ANDY: What? 
PAM: Hey! 
TOBY: Hey. 
PAM: How'd the run go? 
TOBY: Ah, pretty good. I finished. 
PAM: That's great! 
DWIGHT: Psh, why is that great? 
PAM: Because he accomplished something. 
DWIGHT: What was your mile time? 
TOBY: About seven. 
DWIGHT:  I could beat that on a skateboard. 
TOBY: Well, that has wheels. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time. 
PAM: Really, Dwight? How fast are you? 
DWIGHT: Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake. 
PAM: Really? 
DWIGHT: I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther. 
DWIGHT: Man, what is taking Toby so long? 
PAM: Oh, I'll just time him later. 
DWIGHT: And you'll compare the times? 
PAM: Yeah. Are you ready? 
DWIGHT: No, my groin... 
PAM: Set 
DWIGHT: ...is really tight. 
PAM: Go! 
DWIGHT: I can't...  
PAM: Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company.  Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby. 
DWIGHT: Aaaaah! 
PAM: I should probably get back to work. 
MICHAEL: Here... Who's here? 
DWIGHT: Nametag? 
MICHAEL: Yes, please. 
DWIGHT: Karen Filippelli. 
MICHAEL: Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li. 
DWIGHT: Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus.  
MICHAEL: Who's next? 
DWIGHT: That's Andy Bernard. 
MICHAEL: Andy Bernard. 
DWIGHT: If I were you... 
MICHAEL: Saint Bernard. 
DWIGHT: ...I would fire Anthony Gardner... 
MICHAEL: What? 
DWIGHT: ...before noon... 
MICHAEL: I'm not... 
DWIGHT: ...to consolidate power. 
MICHAEL: I'm not firing somebody on the first day. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner. 
DWIGHT: The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person. 
PAM: Good morning! 
MICHAEL: Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league. 
PAM: Okay. 
PAM: Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back. 
HANNAH: Hello? 
MICHAEL: Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr. 
DWIGHT: Hannah Smoterich-Barr. 
MICHAEL: Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here. 
MICHAEL: You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned,  this says 'World's Best Dad'. 
MICHAEL: Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name? 
TONY: Gardner. 
MICHAEL: Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay. 
TONY: Thanks. 
KEVIN: Michael, I didn't get a gift bag. 
MICHAEL: Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later. 
HANNAH: My bag's mostly pencils. 
MICHAEL: Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy. 
KEVIN: Can I have your pencils? 
HANNAH: No. 
PAM: Hi! 
KAREN: Hi. 
PAM: I'm Pam. 
KAREN: Karen. I love your sweater. 
PAM: Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me. 
KAREN: Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn... 
MICHAEL: Welcome. 
KAREN: ...to knit. 
MICHAEL: Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader. 
KAREN: Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian? 
MICHAEL: Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh? 
ANDY: I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs. 
ANDY: Hello. 
MICHAEL: Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome! 
ANDY: And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello. 
MICHAEL: A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you. 
ANDY: Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
ANDY: Nifty! 
MICHAEL: They are nifty! They're nifty gifties. 
MICHAEL: You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him. 
MARTIN: ...which is why they need a passing game. 
JIM: Right. 
MICHAEL:  No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man. 
JIM: Okay. 
MICHAEL:  How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you. 
MARTIN: Oh! Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is... 
JIM: Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here. 
PAM: Oh my god! It's really you! 
JIM: Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met... 
PAM: I know. I don't care. 
JIM: Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good. 
PAM: It's really good to see you. 
JIM: You, too. 
JIM: Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand. 
DWIGHT: Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford. 
JIM: Hey, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me. 
JIM: Okay. Sounds good. 
DWIGHT: What are you doing? 
JIM: I don't know what you're talking about. 
DWIGHT: I have a smudge on my forehead? 
JIM: No. Looks good. 
DWIGHT: Why are you looking at my forehead? 
JIM: I'm not. 
DWIGHT: Meet my eye line, Jim! 
JIM: I am. 
DWIGHT: Stop acting like an idiot! 
JIM: Okay. 
RYAN: Hey, buddy. Welcome back. 
JIM: Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you. 
RYAN: I'm good! How are you? So... 
JIM: Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now? 
RYAN: Yeah. 
JIM: Oh. 
RYAN: Um... unless you really, really want it back. 
JIM: You know, man, it's really you're call. 
RYAN: Cool, thank you. 
JIM:  Let me get that for you. 
RYAN: Yuh. 
JIM: This one taken? No. Good. 
RYAN: Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk. 
TOBY: Hey, this came with the Stamford book.  Can you take care of it? 
KEVIN: Oh, yes I can. 
KEVIN: In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need. 
ANDY: Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike. 
MICHAEL: Right. 
DWIGHT: Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager. 
ANDY: Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales. 
DWIGHT: So you'll be reporting to me, then. 
ANDY: Umm, on the contrary. 
DWIGHT: My title has 'Manager' in it. 
ANDY: And I'm a director. 
DWIGHT: Oh. 
ANDY: Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film? 
DWIGHT: I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them. 
ANDY: Congratulations. 
JIM: Hey, Toby! 
TOBY: Hey, Jim! 
JIM: How are you, man? 
TOBY: Oh, really good. 
JIM: I just wanted to say hi. 
TOBY: How are you? Hey. Welcome back.  
JIM: Oh. Is that like your new thing? 
TOBY: No, I'm sorry, it's... 
JIM: No. It's cool. 
TOBY: No, it's nothing. We'll just...  
JIM: All right. Good to be back. 
TOBY: So... okay. 
JIM: All right. 
TOBY: All right... sorry... sorry about that. 
JIM: No problem. 
TOBY: It was just... 
JIM:  ...what? 
TOBY: Nothing. 
KEVIN: This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh!  Shoot. 
MICHAEL:  I present the orientation video. 
DWIGHT: We need to talk! 
MICHAEL: Not now. 
DWIGHT: Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales? 
MICHAEL: I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale. 
DWIGHT: Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy? 
MICHAEL: It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one. 
DWIGHT: Ok. Who reports to who? 
MICHAEL: I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok? 
DWIGHT: And then if I want... 
MICHAEL: Work it out amongst your selves! 
DWIGHT: I... 
MICHAEL: Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company? 
DWIGHT: I... 
MICHAEL: Will you? 
DWIGHT: One... 
MICHAEL: Please? 
KELLY: Jim! 
JIM: Kelly! 
KELLY: Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you! 
JIM: Really? 
KELLY: Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing! 
JIM: Great. What's new with you? 
KELLY: I just told you. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in! 
MICHAEL: Yoko shack. Male 
VOICE: ...thank you James.  
MEREDITH: Hey, champagne. 
MICHAEL: Nope, no. Guests only. 
KELLY: Looks like salmon. 
MICHAEL: Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo. 
KELLY: I eat beef. 
MICHAEL: Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy. 
KEVIN: The beef is poisoned? 
MICHAEL: No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself. 
TOBY: Um... You might want these orientation materials. 
MICHAEL: Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please. 
JIM: Oh, this looks promising. 
PAM: You won't be disappointed. 
MICHAEL: Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton". 
VIDEO:  
MICHAEL: Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'. 
DWIGHT: Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty. 
MICHAEL: So check out how we live Michael & 
DWIGHT: in the Electric City! 
MICHAEL: They call it Scranton. 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Scranton. 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider. 
DWIGHT: But check that it's covered by your health care provider! 
JIM: It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'. 
MICHAEL:  I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food. 
VIDEO:  
MICHAEL: You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot, 
DWIGHT: But the little cars go in the compact spot Michael and 
DWIGHT: Spot, spot, spot, spot ... 
MICHAEL:  Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What? 
MICHAEL: Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'. 
KAREN:  This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. 
JIM: Terrible. Totally unconvincing. 
KAREN:  This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. 
JIM: Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian. 
KAREN:   Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza. 
JIM: You feel good? 
KAREN: Mm-hm. 
JIM: All right. 
KAREN:  Karen Filippelli. 
ANDY: Hey, buddy. Anything new to report? 
DWIGHT: Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works. 
ANDY: Sure thing, buddy. 
ANDY: Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm. 
ANDY: Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver. 
ANGELA: Oh. 
ANDY: Do you like it? 
ANGELA: I do like it, actually. 
ANDY: Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
ANDY: You're welcome. 
PAM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey! 
PAM: What happened to grape soda? 
JIM: Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase. 
PAM: Oh. You've changed so much. 
JIM: Well, I'm evolving, Pam. 
PAM: So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work? 
JIM: Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever. 
JIM: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I... 
JIM: Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm... 
MICHAEL: All right. 
JIM: Don't... 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
JIM: All right.  I should probably get back to work. Get back to work. 
PAM: Yeah. I know, me too. 
JIM: All right! 
PAM: The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good. 
HANNAH:  Take a picture. It'll last longer. 
RYAN: I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting. 
CREED: Ditto that, my brother. 
HANNAH: Look what's on his computer. 
MICHAEL: What is that? A squid's eye or... 
HANNAH: It's my left breast. 
MICHAEL: How did you... 
CREED: Right place at the right time. 
KAREN: Uh, what's that smell? 
PHYLLIS: What smell? 
KAREN: Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, I'll help you find it. 
KAREN: Oh, you know. Never... .never mind. 
PHYLLIS: What is it? 
KAREN: I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume. 
PHYLLIS: My perfume? 
KAREN: It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells. 
PHYLLIS: Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine. 
KAREN: Who's Bob Vance? 
PHYLLIS: You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie. 
STANLEY: I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word. 
MICHAEL: People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause. 
MICHAEL: I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just. 
DWIGHT: Do you have batteries? 
MICHAEL: Ssshh stupid! Um... 
ANDY:  
MICHAEL: That's it! 
ANDY:  What is love? 
MICHAEL: Yes, yes! Okay! 
ANDY: Baby, don't hurt me. 
MICHAEL: Okay, here we go. Andy & 
MICHAEL: Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me! 
MICHAEL: Oh! 
ANDY: Baby, don't hurt me! 
MICHAEL: Oh! Oh! Oh! 
ANDY: Whoa-oh-oh-oh 
MICHAEL: Scuse me! Scuse me! Andy & 
MICHAEL: Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh... 
MICHAEL: You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow! 
ANDY: Whoa-oh-oh-oh. 
MICHAEL: You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy! 
ANDY: Oh, probably because of all the nose candy. 
MICHAEL:  Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor. 
DWIGHT: Very funny, Michael! 
MICHAEL: Okay! Okay! 
DWIGHT: Really funny, Michael! 
MICHAEL: All right, all right, I'm on a roll. 
MICHAEL: Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them. 
KAREN: Shouldn't we be equals? 
MICHAEL: Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would. 
TONY: Uh... this is difficult, for me. 
MICHAEL: I understand. We're all friends. 
TONY: No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table. 
MICHAEL: Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up. 
TONY:  
MICHAEL: You know what? I'll help. I will... 
TONY: No, please. No. 
MICHAEL: Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this! 
DWIGHT: Do this. Come on. Ready? 
MICHAEL: Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up. 
DWIGHT: On three. One... two... three. 
MICHAEL: Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here. 
TONY: All right. All right. Stop. Put me down. 
MICHAEL: We've almost got it. Push it! Push it! 
TONY: Let me go! 
MICHAEL: I'm right in your crack! 
TONY: Put me down right... 
MICHAEL: Up and over. 
TONY: Put me down! 
MICHAEL: Up and over. 
TONY: Put me down right now! 
MICHAEL: You've got it. 
TONY: I'VE HAD ENOUGH! 
MICHAEL: You've got it, you've got it. 
TONY: PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else! 
MICHAEL: Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay. 
DWIGHT: Hey, hey. Easy. 
MICHAEL: Easy. 
TONY: I'm sorry! 
MICHAEL: Don't... 
TONY: It's just not going to work for me. 
MICHAEL: What... 
TONY: I have to go. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. 
TONY: I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit. 
MICHAEL: Well, we'll squeeze you in. 
TONY: I can't work here. I have to quit. 
MICHAEL: You can't quit! On the first day. That's  heresy, my friend!  Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what? 
TONY: No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style. 
MICHAEL: My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny? 
TONY: No. Was it supposed to be funny? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired. 
TONY: Excuse me? 
MICHAEL: You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk! 
TONY: But there's nothing in my desk except coupons. 
MICHAEL: Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you. 
DWIGHT: That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him. 
MICHAEL: Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice?  Fire Andy. Fire. Andy. 
ANDY: Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle. 
HANNAH: Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional. 
ANGELA: Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club. 
MICHAEL: Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide. 
STANLEY: Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together. 
MICHAEL: No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King. 
MICHAEL: The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it. 
MICHAEL: Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires. 
DWIGHT: What! 
MICHAEL: Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on! 
KAREN: Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration? 
JIM: Does he ever. 
MICHAEL: Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators. 
DWIGHT: YEAH! 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
TOBY: I don't... I don't think we can do that. 
MICHAEL: Go home, Toby. Just... 
MARTIN: Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire? 
MICHAEL: Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful.  "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!" 
HANNAH: For crying out loud. 
MICHAEL: No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh... 
MARTIN:  What's up with this guy? 
STANLEY: Got an hour? I'll try to explain. 
MICHAEL: THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious! 
STANLEY: Trust me. It only gets worse. 
MARTIN: Is he always like this? 
RYAN: Sometimes he brings more costumes. 
HANNAH: When do people work? 
PHYLLIS: Oh, we find little times during the day. 
KAREN: How are we going to get home? 
PHYLLIS: Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up. 
KAREN: Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration. 
MICHAEL: See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.  Jell-o! 
JAN: Michael! 
MICHAEL: Hi, Jan! 
JAN: Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit? 
MICHAEL: I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted. 
JAN: Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
JAN: You do? 
MICHAEL: But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two. 
JAN: What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two. 
MICHAEL: What? 
JAN: He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos. 
MICHAEL: So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two. 
DWIGHT: If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise. 
JIM: Yeah, it does, actually. 
DWIGHT: So who will be your new Number Three? 
MICHAEL: Uh... that I have not decided yet. 
ANDY: Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb. 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks. 
DWIGHT: And I have to say your leadership... 
MICHAEL: Shut it... 
DWIGHT: has brought... 
MICHAEL: Shut it! That's...  suck up! 
JIM:  Hey! Where you at, Filippelli? 
KAREN:  I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy. 
JIM:  What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day? 
KAREN: Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink. 
JIM: Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... .  Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back? 
KAREN: Yeah. 
JIM: Ok, thanks. 
KAREN: Ok. 
JIM: Hey. 
PAM: Hey! 
JIM: I thought you had already... left. 
PAM: Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do. 
JIM: Oh... Good. 
PAM: What's up? 
JIM: Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something. 
PAM: What do you mean? 
JIM: I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh... 
PAM: Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want. 
JIM: O..ok. Um..good. 
PAM: We're friends. We'll always be friends. 
JIM: Right. 
PAM: It's good to have you back. 
JIM: Yeah. Good to be back. 
MEREDITH: Where'd you get that salad? 
KEVIN: Staples. 
ANDY: Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon? 
DWIGHT: Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please. 
ANDY: Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese. 
DWIGHT: Xterra's not even a real word. 
ANDY: Actually, it is. It's Latin for "earth." 
DWIGHT: Oh, so you drive an X-Earth? 
ANDY: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth. 
ANDY: Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back. 
DWIGHT: Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87. 
ANDY: Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came. 
DWIGHT: Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die. 
ANDY: Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University. 
DWIGHT: Idiot! 
ANDY: If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm. 
DWIGHT: If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world. 
ANDY:  Idiot! 
DWIGHT:  You're the idiot! 
ANDY:  Nice comeback! 
DWIGHT:  I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked.  Totally got the best of that interchange. 
PAM: Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable! 
HANNAH: He. 
PAM: ...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink. 
HANNAH: That's his favorite color. 
PAM: ...Oh. That's... fun for him. 
STANLEY: Fantastic. 
MICHAEL: Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute. 
HANNAH: Thank youuu. 
MICHAEL: Ohh. May I? 
HANNAH: Uh, sure! 
MICHAEL:  Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from "Look Who's Talking." What am I thinking?  Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts. 
KAREN: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
KAREN: ...Almost done? 
JIM: Just about... yup. Now. 
JIM: Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know. 
ANGELA: Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting. 
JAN:  Mmhmm. 
ANGELA: Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means. 
JAN: We get that money for hiring an ex-convict. 
MICHAEL: I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... I'm just kidding. 
JAN: When did the check come? 
ANGELA: Last week. 
JAN: Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move. 
ANGELA: One of the Stamford people is a criminal? 
MICHAEL: Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby. 
ANGELA: Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal? 
JAN: Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line. 
PAM:  Who is it? 
MICHAEL: Hannah? 
KEVIN: Hmm. 
ANGELA: Hmm. 
KEVIN: Andy. 
ANGELA: Andy? 
KEVIN: Hmm. Martin? 
MICHAEL: Kuhhhh... you are such a racist. 
KEVIN: Wait, why am I a racist? 
MICHAEL: Because you think he's black. 
KEVIN: He is black... right? And... 
MICHAEL: Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now. 
JAN: ...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash. 
KEVIN: Yeah! 
JAN: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake. 
KEVIN: I wonder what he did. 
MICHAEL: In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened. 
PAM: Why would anyone go to jail for that? 
MICHAEL: Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people. 
KEVIN: Cool. 
PAM: Okay. Angela? 
ANGELA: Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that. 
MICHAEL: Good. All right.  
JIM:  Jim Halpert. 
ANDY:  I am so horny. 
JIM: ...Okay I can't... help you... with that. 
ANDY: Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack. 
JIM: She is dating Ryan, I think. 
ANDY: Oh, and I care why? 
JIM: She's... high-maintenance. 
ANDY: Next. How about... . Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that. 
JIM: Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one. 
ANDY: Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it? 
JIM: ...Absolutely you should. 
ANDY: Jackpot. 
MICHAEL: Just... try to be cool. 
DWIGHT: I am cool. 
MICHAEL: Okay, are you cool, really? 
DWIGHT: I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on. 
MICHAEL: Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison.  No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool! 
DWIGHT: I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals. 
ANDY: All... righty, let's get started. What is she into? 
JIM: I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates... 
JIM: Frisbee-based competitions... 
ANDY: Are you kidding? 
JIM: She... 
ANDY: I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf. 
JIM: Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin? 
MICHAEL: Hey Martin, how's it going? 
MARTIN: Good. Getting settled, you know? 
MICHAEL: Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust. 
PAM: My dad. 
MICHAEL: ...Danny Glover.  Yeah. 
JIM: Jonas Salk. 
MICHAEL: Who? 
JIM: Justin Timberlake? 
MICHAEL: Oh. Please. Colin Powell. 
KAREN: Hey I got one. 
MICHAEL: Yup. 
KAREN: Jesus. 
MICHAEL: Apollo Creed. 
MICHAEL: Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you. 
MARTIN: So... you all wanna know what I was in for? 
MICHAEL: No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them. 
MARTIN: Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink. 
MICHAEL:  That is awesome. 
KEVIN: I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day. 
PAM: What was prison like? 
MARTIN: Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time. 
KEVIN: You got outdoors time? 
MARTIN: Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games... 
KEVIN: Michael, why don't we get outdoors time? 
PAM: Yeah, some days I never go outside. 
MICHAEL: Well, we are running a business, so. 
MEREDITH: What was your cell like? 
MARTIN: Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michael's office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time's our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes. 
PAM: They have art classes? 
MARTIN: Yeap. Yeah. 
RYAN: They have business classes there? 
MARTIN: They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business. 
PAM: Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: Ah. Well. That's not true. 
KEVIN: I would so rather be in prison. 
RYAN: Prison sounds great. 
MICHAEL: No you would not. 
MICHAEL: This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison. 
CREED:  Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this? 
KAREN: You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow. 
CREED: Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo? 
ANDY: Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around. Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay? 
PAM: Wow... I-- 
ANDY: Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back. 
PAM: Wow. That was... wow. 
MICHAEL: Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go! 
PAM: Michael, it's freezing out. 
PHYLLIS: I can't feel my toes. 
MICHAEL: Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up? 
JIM: What is that, like... five pounds? 
MICHAEL: It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone. 
STANLEY: I'm going back inside. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time. 
MICHAEL: Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint? 
MARTIN: Yeah, in the rec room. 
MICHAEL: Ah. A ten inch black and white? 
MARTIN: Actually, our TV was bigger than that one. 
MICHAEL: These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole. 
JIM: Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
JIM: Quick question - do you play the guitar? 
ANDY: I play the banjo. 
JIM: Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice? 
ANDY:  You know I can, my man. 
JIM: Yup. That's perfect. 
KAREN: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
ANDY: I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car. 
JIM: Perfect. 
KAREN: What is going on? 
JIM: ...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him. 
KAREN: I love it. I want in. Who's the target? 
JIM: ...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but... 
KAREN: Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment. 
JIM: Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else. 
MICHAEL: All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?! 
ANGELA: Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else? 
MICHAEL: Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you.  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap! 
RYAN: Michael, please.  
JIM: Where... did you learn all of this? 
MICHAEL: Internet. 
JIM: So, not prison. 
MICHAEL: And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office. 
JIM: What'd you do, Prison Mike? 
MICHAEL: I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom. 
JIM: That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike. 
MICHAEL: And I nevah got caught, neither. 
JIM: Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm. 
PAM: Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison? 
MICHAEL: Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair. 
ANDY: Wow. Prison sounds horrible. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks. 
DWIGHT: Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison? 
ANGELA: Don't encourage him, Dwight. 
MICHAEL: The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt! 
KAREN: Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter? 
MICHAEL: No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it? 
PAM: Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you. 
MARTIN: Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go.  
JIM: Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out. 
MICHAEL: No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas. 
KEVIN:  Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have-- 
HANNAH: Shh! 
TOBY:  This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from? 
TOBY: Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room? 
MICHAEL: They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt. 
TOBY: Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will. 
MICHAEL: Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so. 
TOBY: You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny. 
MICHAEL:  Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms! 
MICHAEL: Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black. 
ANDY:  So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee... 
DWIGHT: Merry Christmas!  
PAM: Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here? 
DWIGHT: Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead. 
PAM: Dwight, what uh... 
DWIGHT: I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle! 
PAM: Well, get it out of here. 
DWIGHT: Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen? 
JIM: Merry Christmas Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Jim. 
JIM: Wow. What have we got here? 
DWIGHT: What does it look like? 
JIM: Dead goose. 
DWIGHT: And circle gets the square. 
JIM: All right. 
DWIGHT:  So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk. 
TOBY: Oh, Dwight, we talked about this. 
DWIGHT: No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead. 
DWIGHT: Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed. 
DWIGHT: He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. 
JIM: Wow. Win-Win. 
DWIGHT: Exactly. Thank you, Jim. 
PHYLLIS: I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it? 
CREED: That's crazy. It's crazy. 
TOBY: Dwight, you cannot keep that here. 
DWIGHT: Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas. 
TOBY: Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour. 
DWIGHT: It's Christmas Toby. 
TOBY: It's a dead animal in an office. You can't... 
DWIGHT: Toby... 
TOBY: I'm sorry. 
DWIGHT:  Please? Please? 
TOBY: Clean it in your car. 
PAM: I would like it off my desk. 
DWIGHT: Oh Pam. Take a chill pill. 
MICHAEL:  Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la.  'Tis the ... ack.  Hey!  I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint... 
PAM: Can I help you, Michael? 
MICHAEL: I'm looking for the toy drive box. 
PAM: It's behind you. 
MICHAEL: OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks. 
JIM: Wow. What kind of bike is that? 
MICHAEL: Umm... I don't know? Average kind? 
KEVIN: The tires look pretty worn. 
MICHAEL: Well, that is probably from the test drive. 
JIM: But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael? 
MICHAEL: No. 
ANDY: Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thanks.  
PAM: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that. 
PAM:  I didn't, it's from corporate. 
MICHAEL: OK. Did everybody get one of these? 
PAM: Yup. 
MICHAEL: Terrific. Good. 
MICHAEL: This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her.  I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah. 
JIM:  Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy in the box, Creed. 
CREED: And a happy holiday to you. 
JIM:   Carol. 
CAROL: Hi, is Michael around here? 
MICHAEL: There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde.  
CAROL: Michael. 
MICHAEL: Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side. 
CAROL:  What? 
MICHAEL: Turn around, turn around. Come on.  
CAROL: Get outta here. 
MICHAEL: No, you get outta here. 
ANDY: Michael 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
ANDY: If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her. 
DWIGHT:  Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
CAROL: I really need a moment alone with you.  
MICHAEL: Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp. 
CAROL: What is this?  
MICHAEL: That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings. 
CAROL: No. See, we never went on a ski trip. 
MICHAEL: I know. 
CAROL: I went on a ski trip. 
MICHAEL: Right. 
CAROL: Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband. 
MICHAEL: Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart... 
CAROL: Michael. 
MICHAEL: And next to your kids. What? 
CAROL: This is so weird. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand? 
JIM: It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy.  Is bold the right word? 
CAROL: I think you're a really sweet guy. 
MICHAEL: OK 
CAROL: But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing . And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us. 
MICHAEL: No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaica's largest fresh water pool. 
CAROL: What are you talking about? 
MICHAEL: I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is. 
CAROL: Oh, no. Michael. 
MICHAEL: And it's all inclusive. 
CAROL: Michael... 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
CAROL: I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over. 
CAROL: I know.  
PAM: Psst. Jim.  Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you. 
JIM: What? 
PAM: For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.  
JIM: Are you serious? 
PAM: They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell. 
JIM:  Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow. 
PAM: So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is.  Sorry I didn't wrap it. 
JIM:  You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know? 
PAM: Oh. 
JIM: No, because of the promotion. 
PAM: Oh yeah. 
JIM: It just feels a little bit, like... 
PAM: No, I get it, of course. OK.  
JIM: I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing? 
MICHAEL: I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled. 
STANLEY: You can't cancel a holiday. 
MICHAEL: Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's. 
STANLEY: What does that mean? 
MICHAEL: Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley. 
PAM: Michael, what's going on? 
MICHAEL: Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. 
JIM: Will they still air 'Rudolph?' 
KEVIN: That's not fair. 
DWIGHT:  Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well? 
MICHAEL: Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests. 
PHYLLIS: But we invited guests. 
MICHAEL: Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess. 
MICHAEL: Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts. 
PAM: I know. 
MICHAEL: It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms. 
PAM: OK, well, why are you laying like that? 
MICHAEL:  Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts? 
PAM: Like what? 
MICHAEL: Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary? 
PAM: Well.. um I, I don't... 
MICHAEL: And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to? 
PAM: I don't need to know. 
DWIGHT: Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short. 
MICHAEL: Take it from Toby. 
DWIGHT: Copy. 
MICHAEL: Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me? 
PAM: No, thank you. 
MICHAEL: It's all...  OK. 
TOBY: Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe-  Why? 
ANGELA: Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch. 
PHYLLIS: I thought you said green was whorish. 
ANGELA: No, orange is whorish. 
KAREN: Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... . 
ANGELA: It would never work here. 
KAREN: Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ... 
ANGELA: No. 
KAREN: A Christmas drinking game ... 
MEREDITH: Yes. 
ANGELA: God help you. 
KAREN: What? 
ANGELA: These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas." I think you should leave. 
KAREN: You're kidding. 
ANGELA: You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on.  Please.  Thank you. OK, thank you very much.  
MICHAEL: What are you doing?  
DWIGHT:  We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol. 
ANDY: Hey, what's the haps?  
MICHAEL: Carol? 
DWIGHT: Oh, look at this.  Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box.  
DWIGHT: Why don't you just buy the whole song? 
MICHAEL: I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it. 
DWIGHT: Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem.  But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie. 
MICHAEL:  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.  
MICHAEL: This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her. 
PAM: I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her. 
PAM: Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy. 
KAREN: Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go. 
PAM: Um, usually like that. 
KAREN: Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..? 
PAM: I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.  
KAREN: Right. 
PAM: Um, I really liked your karaoke idea. 
KAREN: Oh cool, yeah. 
PAM: That could really be fun. 
KAREN: Oh, thank you. 
PAM: You guys do a raffle? 
KAREN: Yeah, we do a raffle... 
TOBY: Hey Kev. 
KEVIN: Hey.  
ANGELA: This should've been up yesterday.  
PHYLLIS: It'll be all right. 
ANGELA:  What is that?  The "Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?" There's no such thing as the "Committee to Plan Parties." 
PAM: There is now. We just started it. 
ANGELA: Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding. 
KAREN: What's your funding? 
ANGELA: Two hundred dollars. 
PAM: What's ours again? 
KAREN: Umm, two hundred and one dollars. 
PAM: Oh right. 
KELLY:  Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun. 
ANGELA: No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock. 
KEVIN: Then why are there two flyers? 
KAREN: Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three. 
KEVIN: Right. 
KAREN: And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five. 
PAM: Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer.  
KEVIN: I didn't see where it was. 
JIM: Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right? 
KAREN: I think that's a really good option... 
DWIGHT: Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately. 
PAM: You can't do that. 
DWIGHT: As ranking number three in this office, I am order - 
ANDY: Umm... I'm number three. 
DWIGHT: You're number four. 
ANDY: Yeah, but I'm number three. 
DWIGHT: Ah, no.  You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth. 
JIM: OK, I think I can help here. 
DWIGHT: Ok, good 
JIM: As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now. 
DWIGHT: OK, this is stupid. 
JIM: Could you please keep it down?  I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid.  
DWIGHT: No no, no, wait, wait, wait  Permission to join the Validity Committee. 
JIM: Permission denied. 
DWIGHT: Damn it! 
ANDY: Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch.  C'mon, my treat. 
MICHAEL: All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway. 
ANDY: That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too. 
MICHAEL: Hooters? 
ANDY: No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too.  
MICHAEL: Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters. 
RYAN: Ah man, I can't. 
MICHAEL: Why not? 
RYAN: I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night.  
MICHAEL: Ok, feel better. 
RYAN: Thanks. 
MICHAEL: C'mon Jim, let's go. 
JIM: OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude. 
RYAN: Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.  Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back. 
MICHAEL: Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'. 
ANDY: So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today."  Thank you. Michael  Head of the table. 
DWIGHT: Get out Jim.  Actually, um...  Sir, I'm going to need take this chair. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy. 
ANDY: So she looks at me right, and she goes, "I'm sorry, don't I even know you?" After a year, a year of buying lattes from her, do you believe that? 
JIM: Yes. 
DWIGHT: I can't... I can't here what you're saying. 
MICHAEL: Carol used to drink lattes. 
DWIGHT:  What're you talking about? 
MICHAEL: She would get this little foam mustache... 
DWIGHT:  Carol had a mustache? 
MICHAEL: And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny. 
DWIGHT:  What are you guys talking about? 
MICHAEL: She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy --- 
DWIGHT: Michael! Repeat what you said louder! 
DWIGHT: It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael?  
MICHAEL: I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out... 
ANDY: No. 
DWIGHT: Who are you calling? 
MICHAEL: I'm just gonna call her. 
ANDY: Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here,  we need your help. 
WAITRESS: What can I get for 'ya? 
ANDY: I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes.  
ANDY: One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal. 
PHYLLIS: You should, you should put out salt for the rims  
PAM: That's a great idea. 
ANGELA: Phyllis? 
PHYLLIS: I was just getting a snack. 
PAM: You can have your snack in here. 
ANGELA: Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis. 
PHYLLIS: OK. 
KEVIN: I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know. 
RYAN: I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to. 
ROY: So I only use three? 
PAM: If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong. 
ROY: OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows? 
PAM: Oh, I just get those at any party supply place. 
ROY: OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper? 
PAM: Oh yeah, your mom would love that. 
ROY:  Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later.  
PAM: Bye. 
KAREN: He's cute. You should date him. 
PAM: Oh, yeah... Maybe. 
DWIGHT: Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there. 
CHEF: No, it's Usuba. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though. 
CHEF: Actually, the Usuba's the better knife when you're working with this quantity. 
DWIGHT: Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better. Woman at 
BAR: I think he'd know.  
MICHAEL: Nothing he's doing is cheering me up. 
ANDY: Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you? 
CINDY: I don't know. 
MICHAEL: Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.  
ANDY: You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us.  Watch, watch, watch, watch.  Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya? 
MICHAEL: You're right. That's good. 
PAM: Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... . 
ANGELA: I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer.. for further regarding your paycheck!  
ANGELA:  I need to know if I can start the party? 
DWIGHT: Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!  
ANDY: This drink...  
MICHAEL: I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party. 
ANGELA: Did Michael give you permission to do this? 
DWIGHT:  Start the party. 
ANGELA:  Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now  
PAM: Our party is also starting now  
KAREN: Yup. 
KAREN:  All right Stanley. Woo. 
PAM: Good choice.  
ANGELA: Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed. 
HANNAH: Why would I be disappointed? 
ANGELA: I said you wouldn't be disappointed.  
ANGELA: Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry. 
MEREDITH: Is that a threat? 
ANGELA: No, it's an invitation. 
PAM: We have vodka! 
KAREN: Lots of it!  
KEVIN: I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela  Hmmm... 
ANGELA: Brownies. Cupcakes.  
KEVIN: Don't push it. 
KAREN: Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough.  What? 
PAM: I got goose bumps. 
ANGELA: I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good. 
MICHAEL: Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef.  Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak.  I see steak. 
MAN: Excuse me. 
MICHAEL: Excuse me  Ah, un guard.  Family style. 
JIM: No, it's not. 
ANDY: Cindy, Cindy. 
MICHAEL: I don't think... I love it! 
ANDY: I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house.  C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day. 
MICHAEL:  I don't know what he's doing. 
ANDY: This is great. 
DWIGHT: Jim! Jim! What... What's happening? 
JIM: Oh,  she's asleep. 
DWIGHT: Oh... Narcolepsy. 
JIM: Probably. 
ANDY: Now open your eyes and describe it to me. 
CINDY: I... don't know, it has four bed rooms and a loft... 
DWIGHT: Oh my gosh, now she's up. 
JIM: And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it. 
DWIGHT: Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood.  Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers. 
JIM: Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing. 
KELLY: What d'ya think?  
STANLEY: Fruity and delicious. 
KELLY: See, I told you. You want one Meredith? 
MEREDITH: No thanks. They're too sweet. 
KAREN: Hey, so what's the status. 
RYAN: Looks like they forgot the power cord. 
PAM: What? 
KAREN: Oh, you're kidding me? 
RYAN: No. 
KAREN: Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine.  
KELLY: Well that blows. 
DARRYL: Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer.  
EVERYBODY: Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!  
PHYLLIS: Hi. 
DARRYL: Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your...  meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, ok. 
DARRYL: All right. Se you later... 
HANNAH:  These nuts are really hard to crack. 
ANGELA: Try harder then.  Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some. 
KEVIN: You've got to be kidding! 
ANGELA: You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie] 
PHYLLIS: Cold, huh? 
RYAN: Huh?  
PHYLLIS: Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there? 
ANDY:  They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding! 
MICHAEL: You know what we should do? 
ANDY: What? 
MICHAEL: We should invite them to the Christmas party. 
ANDY: Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you are such mench my friend.  
MICHAEL: OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend.  
JIM: I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too. 
MICHAEL: The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike. Second 
CINDY: That rocks. 
MICHAEL: Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours. Second 
CINDY: Thanks! I, I wanna give you something. 
MICHAEL: Oh.  That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend. 
ANDY: My new girlfriend. 
ANGELA: Where's Dwight? Second 
CINDY: Is he the hot one or the giant baby? 
MICHAEL:  The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame. 
PHYLLIS:  There's another party in the break room. 
MICHAEL: Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room. 
ANGELA: Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that?  Second 
CINDY: I thought I could have it. 
ANGELA: You can't have it  I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack. 
MICHAEL: Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party. 
DWIGHT: Hey! It's Angela!  Hey! 
MICHAEL: We're going to ... 
KEVIN:  I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but... 
MICHAEL: I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos.  And... my question to you  is do you agree? Other 
WAITRESS: Do I agree about what? 
MICHAEL: Do you agree about what?  Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute. Other 
WAITRESS: What're you talking about? 
MICHAEL: What're you talking about? 
KEVIN:  And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know. 
JIM: All right  
ANGELA: Did you have fun at Benihana's? 
DWIGHT: No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything.  
ANGELA: I've had the worse day here  
KAREN:  Dwight, you won the raffle!  
DWIGHT: No... way! Yeah! 
KAREN: Open it! Open it ! Open it!  
DWIGHT: Oh. 
KAREN: Do you like it? 
DWIGHT: Walkie-talkies. 
PAM: Can I talk to you a second? 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
KAREN: Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas. 
PAM:  In the name of Nutcracker Christmas. 
KAREN: Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties. 
ANGELA: I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs? 
PAM: Yeah, but we don't have a power cord. 
ANGELA: Oh, I may have seen it somewhere.  Is it this one? 
PAM: Mmm. Hmm. 
KAREN: Yeah, thanks. 
PAM: We'll go tell everyone. 
KAREN: OK. Andy and 
MICHAEL:  And if you want love, we'll make it. Swim in a big sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break 'em. This is bound to take awhile. Your body is a wonderland.  Your body is a wonderland. 
ANDY: Your hands. 
BOTH: Your body is a wonderland. 
ANDY: I'll use my hands on it. 
BOTH: Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face... 
KELLY:  Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan... 
MICHAEL: When you know, you just know. 
KEVIN: Right. 
MICHAEL: Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable. 
ROY: Which one is she?  
MICHAEL: It's... it's one of those two.  
ROY: You don't know? 
KEVIN: Dude, you should know. 
MICHAEL: Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike. 
MICHAEL: I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like? 
MICHAEL: Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her. Second 
CINDY: You know where I am. 
MICHAEL: Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile  Second 
CINDY: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party. 
CREED:  Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya... 
DWIGHT:  Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy? 
ANGELA:  Copy, Possum. What's your twenty? 
KAREN: No way.  
JIM: What a horrible, horrible movie that was. 
KAREN: And now we get to remember it forever. 
JIM: Thank you. 
KAREN: Thank you.  Second 
CINDY: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, you. How are ya? Second 
CINDY: Hey. This party blows, so we're gonna leave. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and... Second 
CINDY: Cool... 
MICHAEL: Where do you wanna go? Second 
CINDY: I... We're just gonna take off. 
MICHAEL: I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica. Second 
CINDY: No... I have school.  
MICHAEL: You want help? OK... Merry Christmas. Second 
CINDY: Merry Christmas. 
DWIGHT:  Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed... 
MICHAEL: That waitress was the one. 
JIM: No. She wasn't. 
MICHAEL: How can you be sure? 
JIM: Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately  three hours ago. 
MICHAEL: Don't make fun... You're making fun of me. 
JIM: Sorry. 
MICHAEL: I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm. 
JIM: You what? 
MICHAEL: I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike! 
JIM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Oh, why do I feel like crap? 
JIM: You just had a rebound. 
MICHAEL: I had rebound? Yeah. 
JIM: Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart. 
MICHAEL: I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o. 
ANGELA:  Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum.. 
MICHAEL:  Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive... 
ANGELA:  ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum  
OSCAR: Too soon.  
ANGELA:  I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum. 
DWIGHT:  pum pum pum pum pum pum pum 
DWIGHT: Bye Pam. 
PAM: Night. 
JIM:  Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents. 
PAM: We should get him a bus ticket.  To make his trip easier. 
JIM: Oh no, that would be great. 
PAM: It costs seventy five dollars. 
JIM: Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter? 
PAM: Ohh...  
DWIGHT:  What the?  "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone." Destroy phone?  
JIM: All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also...  what is this? 
DWIGHT: Tape recorder. 
JIM: For what? 
DWIGHT: For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts. 
JIM: OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm? 
KAREN: Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment. 
JIM: Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing? 
DWIGHT: What? 
JIM: You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office. 
DWIGHT: I'm not. 
JIM: Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife! 
DWIGHT: I do not have a knife! 
JIM: No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?! 
DWIGHT:  Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar! 
JIM:  Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet. 
DWIGHT: Give me it. I am not. 
PHYLLIS: Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly... 
DWIGHT: Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK. 
KAREN: Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo? 
JIM: Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies. 
DWIGHT: You can't see... You can't see my stomach. 
ANDY: I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in! 
MICHAEL: Hey, mon! 
PAM: Hey. You have a bunch of messages and...  that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed. 
MICHAEL: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax. 
PAM: OK. 
MICHAEL: Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later. 
PAM: It's kind of serious. 
MICHAEL: Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me. 
PAM: How was Jamaica? 
MICHAEL: It was so good. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says "Hey mon," everybody says "Hey mon" back. 
STANLEY: Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here. 
MICHAEL: Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too. 
STANLEY: My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised. 
MICHAEL: OK, well payroll is in charge of all that. 
STANLEY: They said I should talk to you. 
MICHAEL: Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna... 
STANLEY: I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check. 
MICHAEL: You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon. 
JIM: You want to talk about it? 
KAREN: Nope. 
KAREN: I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a "for rent" sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away. 
MICHAEL: Feelin' hot, hot, hot!  Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing. 
PAM: That's good.  
MICHAEL: You know, I had never been out of the country before now? 
PAM: Huh. 
MICHAEL: Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time. 
PAM: It's kind of an impoverished country. 
MICHAEL: Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three. 
PAM: But you can't today, we're doing inventory. 
MICHAEL: Inventory's at the end of December. 
PAM: We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed. 
MICHAEL: I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it. 
MICHAEL: Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans? 
MICHAEL: Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it. 
ANGELA: By the end of the day? That's impossible. 
MICHAEL: The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible." 
JIM: Yep, it's English, it's "impossible." 
ANGELA: Michael, there's no way we can do it in time. 
MICHAEL: How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need. 
MICHAEL: Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign?  "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem." This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem. 
PAM: Oh my God. Is that Jan?  
EVERYBODY: What? Where? 
PAM: On the left. 
EVERYBODY: Oh yeah, oh my God. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue. 
MICHAEL: Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan. 
MICHAEL:  Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica. 
PACKER: Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay. 
PACKER: You took the ice queen? I don't buy it. 
MICHAEL: Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim. 
PACKER: They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim. 
MICHAEL: Oh no? 
PACKER: No. 
MICHAEL: OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it? 
PACKER: Well, no. I got nothing. 
MICHAEL: Check it again. Hit refresh. 
PACKER: Yeah, Mike, still nothing. 
MICHAEL: OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at...  Packer@DunderMifflin.com. Packaging@DunderMifflin.com. Uh oh. 
PACKER: Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture? 
MICHAEL: Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl? 
ROY: He's in the office. 
MICHAEL: OK, Hey, man, how's it going? 
DARRYL: All right, what's up Mike? 
MICHAEL: That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me? 
DARRYL: Yup. 
MICHAEL: OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people? 
DARRYL: Uh huh. 
MICHAEL: OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it. 
DARRYL: Yup. 
MICHAEL: And you sent that out to everyone? 
DARRYL: Mike, I'm very busy down here.  
JIM: Yikes. 
KEVIN: Already sent it to you my friend. 
JIM: Fantastic. 
ANDY: Boring. Call me if she rolls over. 
PAM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
PAM: You OK? 
JIM: Yeah. 
PAM: You sure? 
JIM: Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen. 
PAM: Oh. You want to talk about it? 
JIM: Really? 
MICHAEL: I have a special assignment for you. 
DWIGHT: Who's the target? 
MICHAEL: A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess." 
DWIGHT: What's it of? 
MICHAEL: Not important. 
DWIGHT: Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment. 
MICHAEL: OK, forget it. 
DWIGHT: OK, I accept it. 
JIM: So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much. 
PAM: Hmm. 
JIM: Hmm, what? 
PAM: How far away does she live now, like ten minutes? 
JIM: Yeah, I guess. 
PAM: Honestly, I think you should go easy on her. 
PAM: No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah. 
JIM: Hey, thanks a lot. 
PAM: Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan! 
JIM: Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?  
TOBY: Hey I need to talk to you right now. 
MICHAEL: Not now, not ever. 
TOBY: About you and Jan. 
MICHAEL: Aww, none of your business. 
TOBY: Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship. 
MICHAEL: That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops. 
TOBY: Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now. 
MICHAEL: This is probably the icebreaker you need. 
TOBY: You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR. 
MICHAEL: I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv. 
TOBY: All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo? 
TOBY: All right, thanks Michael. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
ANGELA: OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping. 
KAREN: What are the ingredients of poi? 
PHYLLIS: I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs. 
ANGELA: Did you try the petting zoo? 
PAM:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat. 
PAM: He'll call you back. OK, great. 
MICHAEL: She bought it?  OK. OK. 
DWIGHT:  Michael hit a deer? 
DWIGHT: Michael! Michael!  There's an emergency in the warehouse. 
MICHAEL: There an accident? Somebody hurt? 
DWIGHT: No, it's... involves the photograph. 
MICHAEL: Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no. 
ROY:  Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done. 
MICHAEL: All right.  
ROY: That corporate booty, he likes to hit it! 
MICHAEL: Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman--- 
KEVIN: Jan. 
MICHAEL: No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe... 
JIM: Urkel Grue. 
MICHAEL: My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right? 
MICHAEL: Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot!  
PAM: Hey. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
PAM: What are you doing out here? 
MICHAEL: Island living. You know? 
PAM: Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you. 
MICHAEL: Did she say what it's about? 
PAM: That's all she said. 
ANDY: Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot  
JIM: Uh, I think you dropped this  
KAREN: You sure? 
JIM: Definitely. 
DWIGHT: I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that  be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom. 
MICHAEL: There are copies in the bathroom? 
DWIGHT: There were. A lot of them. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
KAREN: I think I owe you one. 
PAM: Sorry? 
KAREN: For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing. 
PAM: Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous. 
KAREN: Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously. 
PAM: Sure. 
DARRYL: Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up  You see that? This is the greatest night of my life. 
DWIGHT: Who did this to you?  Where is he? 
PAM: What? No, it's not... it's nothing. 
DWIGHT:  It's hot in here. 
PAM: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Yeah. 
PAM:  Thanks. You don't need to stay here. 
DWIGHT: I know.  So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh? 
JAN: Hello everyone. Hello Michael. 
MICHAEL: Guh. 
KEVIN: Hi Jan, you look... tan. 
JAN: I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister. 
KEVIN: Yeah. How was it? 
JAN: Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office. 
MICHAEL: OK, yup. 
JAN: Why am I here, Michael? 
MICHAEL: I... 
JAN: In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me? 
MICHAEL: I... I... Yes. 
JAN: I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself. 
MICHAEL: OK, yeah. 
JAN: This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks. 
MICHAEL: Who is Dr. Perry? I... 
JAN: This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you. 
MICHAEL: And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well. 
JAN: Good, good. 
MICHAEL: So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh... 
JAN: Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time... 
MICHAEL: Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate -  
JAN: Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo. 
MICHAEL: Jan, you... complete... me. 
JAN: Oh, God. 
ROY: Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico? 
PAM: Yeah. 
ROY: I was definitely right.  Oh, brother. 
KEVIN: What am I going to do?  I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art.  
MICHAEL: Jim, could you come in here please? 
HARVEY: Hi, Jim. 
JIM: Hello. 
HARVEY: I am Harvey, a computer. Jim sucks. 
MICHAEL: Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him. 
JIM: Yeah, you can. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Get Pam. 
JIM: For this? 
MICHAEL: Pam. 
HARVEY: Pam, you look very hot today. 
JIM: Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend. 
PAM: Great. 
HARVEY: Me so horny. Me love you long tim. 
MICHAEL: Oh, that is gross. 
PAM: Who is 'Long Tim'? 
MICHAEL: Damn it. 
HARVEY: Long time. Me lobe yoy long time. 
JIM: Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he? 
PAM: I would love to meet Long Tim. 
JIM: Yeah. Right? 
PAM: Yeah. 
HARVEY: You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive. 
JIM: Ok. 
PAM: Ok. Bye Harvey. 
HARVEY: Boobs. 
KEVIN: Angela. 
ANGELA: What? 
KEVIN: That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them? 
ANGELA: They arrived this morning. 
KEVIN: Are you sure? It is a big deal. 
ANGELA: Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin? 
KEVIN: ... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal. 
ANDY: Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river. 
ANGELA: Everything ok?  
DWIGHT: Everything is fine. You are in the clear. 
ANGELA: Thank you.  I... I don't want those. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you. 
ANDY: Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael? 
MICHAEL: Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first. 
ANDY: Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: Oh. 
ANDY: Ph. D. Doctor of Sales. 
MICHAEL: Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you. 
ANDY: Well, it is very gracious of you to accept. 
MICHAEL: Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior. 
PHYLLIS: We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen. 
KAREN: Oh, uh, thanks. 
MICHAEL: Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley. 
STANLEY: Pass. 
MICHAEL: You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody. 
STANLEY: ... I'll take the kid. 
RYAN: I am very flattered. I was his second choice after "Pass." 
MICHAEL: So that just leaves Dwight and Jim. 
DWIGHT: Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade? 
JIM: Yup. I'll trade. 
JIM: Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot. 
ANDY: Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage. 
MICHAEL: Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Yup? 
MICHAEL: Here ya go.  
DWIGHT: Yeah! You want shirts on hangers? 
MICHAEL: Please. 
ANDY: He does your laundry? 
MICHAEL: Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race."  And you guys are the retired marines.  And you guys are the mother and daughter.  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go? 
KAREN: Wait, "Amazing Race" like, the biggest sale wins? 
MICHAEL: No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back. 
RYAN: Is there a prize? 
MICHAEL: Just bragging rights. 
PHYLLIS: Then how is this "Amazing Race"? 
MICHAEL: It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it. 
DWIGHT: Come on!! 
PHYLLIS: Michael.  
MICHAEL: Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos! 
ANDY: Bueno. 
PHYLLIS: Do you have a pole? 
KAREN: Let's go get a broom. 
JIM: Seriously? You're going to sit in the back? 
DWIGHT: Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first. 
MICHAEL: Here we go. 
ANDY: In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down. 
ANDY: What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry? 
MICHAEL: Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment. 
ANDY: Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder. 
ANGELA: Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee? 
PAM: Really? 
ANGELA: Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun. 
PAM: Ok. Sure. 
ANGELA: Ok. 
KAREN: Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon? 
PHYLLIS: Um-hmmm. 
RYAN: Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after? 
STANLEY: You want the lead? 
RYAN: Yeah, if you don't mind. 
STANLEY: Mind? Nothing would delight me more. 
DWIGHT: Leave the keys. 
JIM: You still do that thing? 
DWIGHT: Leave the keys! 
ANDY: I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know? 
MICHAEL: Hawkman. 
ANDY: My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons. 
MICHAEL:  Let's go. The men's room was disgusting. 
JIM: After you sir. 
DWIGHT: No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear. 
JIM: Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front. 
DWIGHT: Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with...  
PAM: Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time. 
ANGELA: This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot. 
PAM: That's great. 
ANGELA: Yes, it is.  Hello? 
MICHAEL: Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack? 
BUYER: Yep. 
MICHAEL: You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big. 
ANDY: Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency. 
ANDY: Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York. 
BUYER: Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past. 
MICHAEL: I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company. 
ANDY: Oh, man, that is, like, poetry. 
MICHAEL: No. 
ANDY: I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree. 
MICHAEL: Stop it.  Stop it. 
ANDY: Ow. 
ANDY: Oh man. Talk about your classic "Lame dash O." Do we even want that guy buying our paper? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
ANDY: I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up. 
MICHAEL: Ah, no. Don't worry about it. 
ANDY: I really 'Schruted' it. 
MICHAEL: What? 
ANDY: 'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. Who knows how words are formed. 
PHYLLIS: It's a big order. Thanks Kenny. 
KAREN: Yeah, thank you. 
PHYLLIS: Hey, how's Annie? 
KENNY: Oh, she's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda? 
JULIUS: Stanley Hudson. 
STANLEY: Ah, Julius, how's it goin'? 
JULIUS: Great, great, great. 
GUY: Stanley. 
STANLEY: So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard. 
RYAN: Hi. 
STANLEY: I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan? 
RYAN: Um...  Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. 
JULIUS: Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us? 
RYAN: Oh... 
JIM: We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser. 
MAN: 'Kay. 'Kay. 
DWIGHT: Can I use your phone? 
MAN: Yeah, sure, go ahead. 
DWIGHT: Thanks. 
JIM: Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked. 
DWIGHT:  One... 
JIM: We have discount prices on ink cartridges... 
DWIGHT: Three... 
JIM: And, also, any forms that you are going to need... 
DWIGHT: Seven... 
JIM: We can custom make them. 
STANLEY: Ha ha ha! And you just said, "Hi! Hi! Hi!" Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old! 
MAN: We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys. 
DWIGHT: Sure. 
JIM: Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service? 
MAN: It's very. 
PHONE: Please keep holding, your call is very important to us. 
DWIGHT: Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time. 
JIM:  And this is Dunder-Mifflin. 
KELLY: Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly. 
JIM: Hey, Kelly, it's Jim. 
KELLY: Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... .  
DWIGHT: Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays. 
MAN: All right, I get it. We got a deal. 
JIM: Thanks. 
KAREN: Thanks. That was fun. 
PHYLLIS: Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person. 
KAREN: Thank you. 
PHYLLIS: I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her. 
KAREN: That's nice. 
PHYLLIS: You can pay me back later for the makeover. 
ANDY: Hey boss. Got a minute? 
MICHAEL: Yes, Andy. 
ANDY: I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning? 
MICHAEL: He didn't say. 
ANDY: That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something? 
MICHAEL: No, you are remembering it wrong. 
MICHAEL: Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three. 
DWIGHT: I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent. 
JIM: Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence. 
DWIGHT: My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys. 
JIM: We should go on a double date. 
DWIGHT: No thank you. 
JAN: Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote "Beeswax. Not yours, Inc." 
MICHAEL: I knew it.  
ANDY: Oh, doggie. 
KAREN: Hey, do you want to grab a coffee? 
JIM: Sure. Look at you! 
KAREN: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Hey, we nailed the sale! 
MICHAEL: Where were you this morning? 
DWIGHT: I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow. 
MICHAEL: Why do you lie, liar? 
DWIGHT: I am not a liar. 
MICHAEL: You are lying right now. 
ANDY: It sure seems like he is lying. 
DWIGHT: Stay out of this, you! 
MICHAEL: I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing. 
DWIGHT: Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company. 
MICHAEL: Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard. 
DWIGHT: That's what she said. 
MICHAEL: Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day. 
DWIGHT: It's going to be ok. 
ANGELA: How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business. 
DWIGHT: That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan. 
ANGELA: I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world. 
DWIGHT: Well, I don't have a lot of choices. 
KAREN: So, let me ask you a question. 
JIM: Ok. 
KAREN: Did you ever have a thing for Pam? 
JIM: Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something? 
KAREN: I moved here from Connecticut... 
JIM: Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay? 
KAREN: 'Kay. 
DWIGHT: Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... . 
ANDY: Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp. 
DWIGHT: I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this. 
MICHAEL: Good luck. 
RYAN: Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed. 
ANGELA: Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had. 
DWIGHT: One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered. 
JIM: Hey man.  
KAREN: What happened on your sales call? 
ANDY: Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty...  Hello? Pretty good. 
DWIGHT: I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting. 
DWIGHT: For your convenience, I've broken it down into three 
PARTS: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia. 
DWIGHT: I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me. 
DWIGHT: How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable. 
DWIGHT: There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon. 
DWIGHT:  I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over. 
ANDY:  Big Turkey.  
JIM: Is that you singing? 
ANDY: All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever. 
JIM: Nice job. 
ANDY: Thank you muchly.  
JIM: You gonna answer it? 
ANDY: I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring. 
JIM: Yikes. 
ANDY: Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you. 
JIM: Thank you. 
ANDY: I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna.  Andy and the tuna... 
JIM: I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win. 
MICHAEL: Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover. 
ANDY: The cost of doing business. 
MICHAEL: Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman... 
ANDY: Was the top salesman... 
MICHAEL: I said 'was'. 
ANDY:  Addition by subtraction. 
MICHAEL: What does that even mean? That is impossible. 
ANDY: Mmmm. Yeah you're right. 
MICHAEL: But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits. 
OSCAR: Hey, everyone. 
KEVIN: Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation? 
OSCAR: Oh, that's very funny. 
KEVIN: Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left. 
OSCAR:  Hi, Angela. 
ANGELA: Oscar. 
ANDY: Hey, boss. 
MICHAEL: Hey, what's up. 
ANDY: Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right? 
MICHAEL: Yep. 
ANDY: Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my "Lost" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out? 
MICHAEL: I don't know. Maybe. 
ANDY: Well, I will take that as a maybe.  Where are you going? 
MICHAEL: Bathroom. 
ANDY: Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you. 
ANDY:  Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss. 
ANGELA: Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee? 
OSCAR: The one of all women? 
ANGELA: Yeah. 
OSCAR: Because I'm gay? 
ANGELA: No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired.  And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations. 
OSCAR: OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you. 
ANGELA: Thank you.  
KEVIN: Can I join too? 
ANGELA: Never. Staples 
GUY: You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work. 
DWIGHT:  Child's play. Give me something hard to sell. 
MICHAEL: Wow.  What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible. 
PAM: Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning. 
PAM: Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office. 
ANDY: Feel ya, dawg. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, do you? 
ANDY: Absolutely. 
MICHAEL: What did I say? 
ANDY: You said...  
MICHAEL: Huh. 
ANDY: Which is like, "Right on." And Pam was like "blah blah blah" and you were like "Yeah, psht." Nailed it. 
MICHAEL: Oh, no. 
ANDY: Oh, no. 
MICHAEL: Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness. 
OSCAR: I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party. 
MICHAEL: No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific. 
OSCAR: Michael -- 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga. 
OSCAR: Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe. 
MICHAEL: Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one. 
DWIGHT: Need any help? 
LADY: Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking. 
DWIGHT: Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all. 
LADY: Okay.  
ANDY: I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here.  Whizzzzz.  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh! 
JIM: Hey. 
KAREN: Hey. 
JIM: So Andy is in rare form today. 
KAREN: Yeah, you should not encourage him. 
JIM: Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something. 
KAREN: Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't. 
JIM: Fine. Party pooper. 
MICHAEL: Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep. 
ANDY: 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew!  
JIM: Hey, Ryan? 
RYAN: What? 
JIM: You wanna pull a prank on Andy? 
RYAN: Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago. 
JIM: I liked you better when you were the temp. 
RYAN: Yeah, me too. 
MICHAEL: Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay? 
PHYLLIS: Sort of. He had a lot of clients. 
MICHAEL: Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight? 
STANLEY: Oh, sure, we talk all the time. 
MICHAEL: Really? 
STANLEY: No. 
MICHAEL: Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close. 
PHYLLIS: No. Sorry. 
PHYLLIS: Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive. 
PARIS: Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell. 
DWIGHT: I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination. 
PARIS: So um, where were you workin' before this? 
DWIGHT: Dunder-Mifflin. 
PARIS: What kind of company is that? 
DWIGHT:  Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area. 
PARIS: I never heard of 'em. 
DWIGHT: Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper? 
PARIS: You gonna be like that, huh? 
PARIS: I don't like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. That's all I got to say on the matter. 
ANDY:  In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed. 
JIM: Would you like to pull a prank on Andy? 
PAM: Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please. 
JIM: Okay, good. Stay right here. 
ANDY:  Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one. 
JIM:  Are there any messages? 
PAM: Nope. 
JIM: So weird. 
PAM:  Hmm. 
MICHAEL: Nice to have Oscar back. 
ANGELA: Yeah. 
ANDY: Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device? 
JIM: No. 
ANDY: Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call. 
PAM: Angela? 
ANGELA: Oh.  
PAM: Is everything okay? 
ANGELA: No. 
ANDY: What's going on? 
JIM: What are you talking about? 
ANDY: Where is my FREAKING phone?! 
JIM: You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling. 
ANDY: Maybe you're in the ceiling! 
JIM: Okay. 
ANDY:  I don't trust you, Phyllis! 
ANGELA: I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me. 
MICHAEL: Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company. 
ANGELA: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you? 
ANGELA: None of them. Especially not Andy. 
MICHAEL: Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly. 
ANDY: Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with? 
MICHAEL: Um. 
ANDY: Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own. 
MICHAEL: No. I don't want to do any of that. 
ANDY: Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that. 
MICHAEL: No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy. 
ANDY: Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.  Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD.  That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good? 
PAM: Yeah. 
ANDY: Sure? Okay. 
DWIGHT:  Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you. 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
DWIGHT: Hey. 
MICHAEL: What's up? 
DWIGHT: Same old. 
MICHAEL: Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did. 
DWIGHT: Oh my God, she told you? 
MICHAEL: Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize. 
DWIGHT: Accepted. 
MICHAEL: How's this place treating you? 
DWIGHT:  The boss isn't funny. 
MICHAEL: Oh, well. 
DWIGHT: I don't get to wear my ties. 
MICHAEL: No. I'm sure. 
DWIGHT: So? 
MICHAEL: So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please. 
DWIGHT: I don't want to do your laundry anymore. 
MICHAEL: We can talk about that.  All right. 
JIM:  Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall. 
PAM: I think we broke his brain.  
JIM:  "It's not freakin' funny!" 
ANGELA: Are you enjoying your fiesta? 
OSCAR: Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out --  it's great. 
MICHAEL: Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute! 
EVERYBODY: Yay.  
ANGELA: Welcome back. 
DWIGHT: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it.  Not bad, huh? 
DWIGHT: You did this for me?  
MICHAEL: Guilty. 
CREED: Oh... Where did you get this stuff? 
MEREDITH: Gerty's. 
CREED: Which aisle? 
MEREDITH: I don't remember. 
CREED: Well, draw me a map, mama. 
MICHAEL: Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours. 
PAM: No, I will not. 
MICHAEL: So does this remind you of your childhood right now? 
OSCAR: It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much. 
JIM: Hey. 
KAREN:  Do you still have feelings for her? 
JIM:  Yes. 
MICHAEL: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?  
DWIGHT: Oh, man.  No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out!  
MICHAEL: It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm. 
ANDY: So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material.  This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so. 
MARCY: Oh, hi. You must be Andy. 
ANDY: Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy! 
MARCY: That's right, it's so good to meet you. 
ANDY: It's so good to meet you! 
MARCY: Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun? 
ANDY: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Hello son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a road--- 
DWIGHT: How do you know it's going to be a boy? 
MICHAEL: How, would you stop interrupting please? 
MICHAEL: Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life. 
MICHAEL: Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to. 
MICHAEL: To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever. 
DWIGHT:  
MICHAEL: Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra. 
PAM: What? 
MICHAEL: We will demonstrate on Pam. 
PAM: No. No.  
MICHAEL: Come on. 
MICHAEL:  You just twist your hand until something breaks. 
DWIGHT: Ow. 
MICHAEL: Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam. 
MICHAEL: And remember no matter what, I will always love you. 
DWIGHT: What if he's a murderer? 
MICHAEL: He's not going to be a murderer. 
DWIGHT: Maybe that's how you die. 
MICHAEL: You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no? 
DWIGHT: I want to do this. 
MICHAEL: Okay. From the top. Ready? Three- 
DWIGHT: Action. 
MICHAEL: Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.  So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta. 
JIM: Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So... 
MICHAEL: I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant. 
MICHAEL: I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes. Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat. 
MICHAEL: What's up spinsters? 
ANGELA: Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only. 
MICHAEL: No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy's night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys. 
KAREN: I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever. 
JIM: Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights. 
PAM: Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck. 
PACKER: Halpert! Tall, queer, handsome as ever. Hey everybody it's me, Jim. Hello, hello. Todd Packer. 
KAREN: Karen Fillipelli. Jim's girlfriend. 
PACKER: Shut up! 
KAREN: Yep. 
PACKER: Shut it! 
KAREN: That's rude. 
PACKER: Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight! 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes! Oh! There-oh!  
PACKER: What happened? 
MICHAEL: Oh God- 
PACKER: Quick somebody help! Help the man!  
MICHAEL: No, no, no! 
MICHAEL: I can't believe you're not going to be there. It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man. 
PACKER: I have a full day of sales calls. 
MICHAEL: You should get out of them. 
PACKER:  
MICHAEL: It's the only time he can do it. 2:30 to 3:15. It's going to be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie. Going to be very delicious. 
PACKER: And what kind of stripper did you get? 
MICHAEL: I did not order a stripper. 
PACKER: You didn't order a stripper? Have you ever even been to a bachelor party? 
MICHAEL: Um, not personally, no. 
PACKER: Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101. If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard. 
MICHAEL: I can't get a stripper here. Sexual Harassment. 
PACKER: Just get one for the girls too. That evens it out. You know, separate but equal. 
MICHAEL: So that's what that means. 
MICHAEL: Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh!  
DWIGHT: Alright! Uh!  
MICHAEL: Gay. 
DWIGHT: What? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies. 
ANGELA: Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office. 
MEREDITH: SHUT UP ANGELA! 
PAM: Hey. 
JIM: Hey. 
PAM: Ugh. 
JIM: Ugh. 
PAM: Everything okay? 
JIM: Oh yeah. Why? 
PAM: Well you seem a little tired. 
JIM: Oh. Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking. 
PAM: You should get more sleep. 
JIM: Yeah, I know I should. 
PAM: Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. 
JIM: No, I'm sure you're right. 
PAM: When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference. 
JIM: Really? 
PAM: Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not. 
JIM: Good advice Beesley. Thanks. See you out there. 
PAM: Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk.  Oh my God. 
MICHAEL: Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers. 
JIM: Absolutely not. 
DWIGHT: I'm on it. 
MICHAEL: Well get on it. And make it happen. 
DWIGHT: Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want- 
JIM: Stop. That's disgusting. 
DWIGHT: Leave me alone and get the male stripper. 
JIM: Fine. 
DWIGHT: I knew you would, Nancy. 
JIM: Sally. 
DWIGHT: No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette? 
JIM: Blonde. 
DWIGHT: Nice. Do you have any blonde women? 
MICHAEL:  
RYAN: He hasn't even said a word yet. Just giggling. 
MICHAEL:  Gotcha, oh!  Yes? 
JIM: Are you okay? 
MICHAEL: I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop. 
JIM: Ah, gotcha. Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants. 
MICHAEL: Squarepants? 
JIM: Yep, Spongebob Squarepants. 
MICHAEL: And you think that'd be sexy? 
JIM: Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings. Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania. Ben 
FRANKLIN: Hold the door please! 
MICHAEL: Oh. Ben 
FRANKLIN: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Hello! Ben 
FRANKLIN: Hello! 
MICHAEL: You wearing a thong? Ben 
FRANKLIN: What? 
ANGELA: Sparkling cider is very good. 
PAM: I think that's champagne. 
ANGELA:  
MICHAEL: Hello ladies. Who here is a history buff? Who's a fan of buff naked? Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin. Ben 
FRANKLIN: Thank you for that introduction, Mr. Scott, and good afternoon fine gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin. 
MICHAEL: Half pants, right Mr. Franklin? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Knickers in fact, yes! 
MICHAEL: He's in his knickers. Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever. Ben 
FRANKLIN: Well, actually, I never was president. 
MICHAEL: Yes, but, Ben Franklin was. Ben 
FRANKLIN: Ah. I'm here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the founding fathers. 
MICHAEL: And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow. 
MEREDITH: Wait, this is the entertainment? 
MICHAEL: Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one.  
JIM: Have you ever seen a stripper before? 
DWIGHT: Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases. 
JIM: Yeah, me neither. 
ELIZABETH: Hey. 
JIM: Hi. 
ELIZABETH: I'm Elizabeth, I'm the dancer that was requested. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper. 
ELIZABETH: I'm the stripper. 
DWIGHT: Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such. 
JIM:  Oh God. 
DWIGHT:  Is she hot? Text back, "Kind of." Ben 
FRANKLIN: It was a warm June evening in 1752, the night of my fateful kite flight. 
KAREN: Mr. Franklin? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Yes? 
KAREN: Do you have a girlfriend? Ben 
FRANKLIN: I have a lovely wife, Deborah. 
PAM: But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like a lot of them? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Uh, well that is a grey area of my life. Okay? So, it was a warm June evening. 
MICHAEL: Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors. 
RYAN: Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on? 
MICHAEL: No. Yes. 
RYAN: Oh gross. 
MICHAEL: But I got all the foot off of it. 
PAM: Okay Ben Franklin! 
KAREN: Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth! Ben 
FRANKLIN: Well, that is because I am a renaissance man. 
PAM: Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Well, you're very saucy!  
MICHAEL: Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat? 
DWIGHT: I do! I want some man meat! 
JIM: Michael, Dwight would like your man meat. 
MICHAEL: Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity. 
STANLEY:  Of course. 
KAREN: So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use? 
PAM: Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it. 
KAREN: Hey um, I wanted to talk to you. I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys. 
PAM: What do you mean? 
KAREN: Well that you kissed. And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal. It's just a kiss. Wait- you're not still interested in him? 
PAM: Oh yeah. 
KAREN: Really? 
PAM: Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim. I'm not going out with Jim. You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together. 
KAREN: Okay. 
PAM: I'm not into Jim. Yeah. 
KAREN: So um, well good. 
PAM: Yeah. Sorry. 
KAREN: What are you sorry about? 
PAM: Um, what? 
KAREN: What are you sorry about? 
PAM: Nothing. I was just thinking of something else. 
KEVIN: Okay. The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild. 
MICHAEL: I call shuffle. Here we go.  
KEVIN: Michael. 
MICHAEL: Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth. 
ELIZABETH: Hi guys! 
MICHAEL: Nice outfit. 
ELIZABETH: I hear there's an important meeting here. 
ROY: I'm not really into strippers. You know what I find sexy? Pam's art. She's an artist and I appreciate that. It's very moving and sexy. The art. 
ELIZABETH: Hit it.  So where's the groom? 
MICHAEL: He's right there. There he is. Bob 
VANCE: Absolutely not. That's all you. That's all you. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Alright, I'll do it. Yeah. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Yeah. What do I? 
ELIZABETH: Just sit on down. 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
ELIZABETH: Alright. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
ELIZABETH: Here we go. 
MICHAEL: Here we go. Alright! 
ELIZABETH: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide. 
ELIZABETH: Mmm, what's that? 
MICHAEL: You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so... 
ELIZABETH: I bet she'd be jealous.  
MICHAEL: Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work! 
DWIGHT: Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it. 
ELIZABETH: You want me to answer phones with my clothes on. 
DWIGHT: We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it. 
ELIZABETH: Oh I love your poster. 
ANGELA: Thank you. 
KEVIN:  Ben 
FRANKLIN: You know I invented electricity. 
PAM: I know. Ben 
FRANKLIN: Well I'm sensing a little electricity right here. 
PAM: Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Yes, but I don't. My name is Gordon. 
PAM: Ohhh. 
MICHAEL: On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me. Ben 
FRANKLIN: You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son. 
MICHAEL: Really. Ben 
FRANKLIN: But I kept all this from my wife Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler sex. 
MICHAEL: Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag. 
MICHAEL: Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me? 
ELIZABETH: Secrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone. 
MICHAEL: Wow. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Care for a piece of chocolate? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Chocolate! Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States. 
DWIGHT: Who is the king of Austria? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Joseph the 2nd. 
DWIGHT: Who is the king of Prussia? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Fredrick Wilhelm the 3rd. 
DWIGHT: Who is the king of England? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Why the tyrant King George, of course! 
DWIGHT: I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure. 
JAN:  Michael, I left a meeting. What is so urgent? Are you, are you okay? 
MICHAEL: Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will. 
JAN: Okay. 
MICHAEL: I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand. 
JAN: Uh when, when did, when last night? 
MICHAEL: No, today at work. 
JAN: You went to a bachelor party at work? 
MICHAEL: Yes. I kind of arranged it. 
KELLY: Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Do you guys think she was hot? 
RYAN: Kelly don't do this. 
KELLY: Do what? I just asked you a question. 
RYAN: You know what you're doing. 
KELLY: Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam. 
JIM: Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there Beesley? 
PAM: Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever. 
RYAN: Ok. 
ELIZABETH: Oh my God, I would get so fat if I worked here. 
PAM: Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time. 
ELIZABETH: You could strip you know. 
PAM: Thanks. 
MICHAEL: So you don't want to end our relationship? 
JAN: I'm closer to firing you. 
MICHAEL: That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that? 
JAN: I'll talk to you later. 
MICHAEL: You are. You are. 
MICHAEL: So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't. 
DWIGHT: Are you near sighted or far sighted? Ben 
FRANKLIN: Both. That's why I invented the bifocal. 
DWIGHT: GAH!!! 
JIM: Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again.  Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid? 
DWIGHT: What do you think? 
JIM: In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment. 
JIM:  Dwight, want an Altoid? 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
JIM:  Altoid? 
DWIGHT: Sure 
JIM:  Mint Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Inbwit? Yes. 
DWIGHT:   
JIM: What are you doing? 
DWIGHT: I... 
JIM: What? 
DWIGHT: I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.  
MICHAEL: Always the bridesmaids, right ladies? 
PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, for this next one everyone hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let's bring Mom back in. And the sisters. And you, and you, and you. Great. 
MICHAEL: Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride. 
PHYLLIS: Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before. 
PAM: Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'. 
JIM: So what's in the box? 
STANLEY: A toaster, you? 
KAREN: A toaster. 
STANLEY: Unbelievable. 
DWIGHT: Hello, Angela. 
ANGELA: Hi, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: You look as beautiful as the Queen of England. 
ANGELA: Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left! 
DWIGHT: The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair. 
JIM: Those flowers are nice. 
KAREN: Yeah. P and R? 
JIM: Phyllis and Robert. 
KAREN: Ah, of course. 
PAM: Also, Pam and Roy. 
MICHAEL: There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin. 
PHYLLIS: Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside. 
MICHAEL: How you doin'? You excited. 
PHYLLIS: Yes, very. 
MICHAEL: Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight? 
PHYLLIS: No. 
MICHAEL: You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous... 
PHYLLIS: That wasn't me. 
MICHAEL: Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle? 
PHYLLIS: I thought it was... 
MICHAEL: Here, let me... 
PHYLLIS: Michael... No. 
MICHAEL: Just cover up that bald patch. 
PHYLLIS: I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet. 
MICHAEL:  I hate you! 
MICHAEL: Long story 
SHORT: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'. 
DWIGHT: Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people? 
JIM: You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers. 
DWIGHT: No way. 
JIM: Did you ever see that movie? 
DWIGHT: Of course I saw it. 
DWIGHT: I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it. 
JIM: You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out. 
DWIGHT: Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift. 
KEVIN:  Hi. I'm Kevin.  Where did you find her? 
TOBY: At the gym. 
KEVIN: Riiight. The gym.  
KELLY: Could you scoot over? You're on my dress. 
MEREDITH: I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding. 
KELLY: I know but there was an emergency. 
KELLY: I look really good in white. 
MICHAEL: This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it. 
PAM: That's my dress. 
MICHAEL:  That's ok.  
DWIGHT: It's a miracle. 
CROWD:  
MICHAEL: This is bull****! 
MICHAEL: Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight. 
MICHAEL: I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over. 
PRIEST: And do you, Phyllis, take Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband? 
PHYLLIS: I do. 
MICHAEL: Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance! 
PRIEST: And do you, Bob... 
MICHAEL: Oh, shiii... 
PRIEST: ... take Phyllis to be your lawfully wedded wife Bob 
VANCE: I do. 
PRIEST: You may now kiss the bride. 
MICHAEL: Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance.  Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! 
ANGELA: Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning. 
PHYLLIS: Thanks Angela. 
MICHAEL: Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you. Bob 
VANCE: If you ever lay I finger on Phyllis, I'll kill you. 
MICHAEL: Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis.  Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too. 
DWIGHT: Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers. 
PHYLLIS: I don't have that, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Dammit, Phyllis! 
KELLY: Are you all right? This must be so awful for you. 
PAM: What do you mean? 
KELLY: Well... this was supposed to be your wedding. 
PAM: Oh... um... no. That's... um... That's actually fine 
KELLY: There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant. 
PAM: Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks 
DWIGHT: 'Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple? Uncle 
AL: Who? 
DWIGHT: The bride and groom? What are their names? Uncle 
AL: Oh, I... I don't... I'm not sure. 
DWIGHT: Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on. Uncle 
AL: Okay, Okay. Where are we going? 
DWIGHT: Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend. Uncle 
AL: Oh! 
MICHAEL: Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter? 
PHYLLIS: It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet. 
MICHAEL: I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back. 
PHYLLIS: It's fish. 
MICHAEL: I will take care of that. 
MICHAEL: I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white. 
KEVIN: No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding. 
KEVIN: Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation.  Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light. 
ROY: Hey. 
PAM: Hey. 
ROY: I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste. 
PAM: You're kidding me, right? 
ROY: I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom. 
PAM: Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding. 
ROY: I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning. 
PAM: Yeah. 
ROY: Sorry about that. 
PAM: It's okay. 
ROY: You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married. 
RANDY: Phyllis, you're a wonderful woman. And you're a hell of a bowler! 
CROWD:  
UNKNOWN: She is. 
RANDY: Cheers. 
CROWD: Cheers. 
MICHAEL: Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride "Mawige... 
MICHAEL: The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones. 
MICHAEL: Phyllis and 
BOB: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance... Bob 
VANCE: Oh okay. That's enough. 
MICHAEL: is a guy that... Bob 
VANCE: Thanks, Michael. Give me... 
MICHAEL: he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay. Bob 
VANCE: Give me the microphone. 
MICHAEL: No. I'm not going to... Bob 
VANCE: Give me... Give me the microphone, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Ok. All right. Bob 
VANCE: You're out of here! 
MICHAEL: Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you! 
JIM: Hey. 
PAM: Hey! 
JIM: When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves? 
PAM: Oh... I'm pacing myself. 
JIM: Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want. 
PAM: No. I'm such a dorky dancer. 
JIM: I know. It's very cute. 
JIM: Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical. 
MICHAEL: Come... Come on! 
DWIGHT: I can't let you in, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, just... 
DWIGHT: No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders. 
MICHAEL: Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song. 
DWIGHT: You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
ROY: Hey, they're playing our song. 
PAM: Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police. 
ROY: I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance? 
MICHAEL:  ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu. 
ROY:  Hey, want to get out of here? 
JIM: Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen. 
KAREN:  Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every... 
WOMEN: One... Two... Three. Ahhhh!  
TOBY: Toby! Yeah! 
MICHAEL: I just want Phyllis to have a great day. Uncle 
AL: Phyllis and you will be great together. 
MICHAEL: We are great together. We are a great team. Uncle 
AL: The Celtics were a great team. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon. Uncle 
AL: Nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn't know! 
MICHAEL: Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head. 
MICHAEL: Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember. 
PHYLLIS: You found Uncle Al! 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo. 
PHYLLIS: Thank you, Michael. 
MICHAEL: You're... You're welcome. 
MICHAEL: They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad. 
MICHAEL: Be careful. Oh no!!  Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me!  
MICHAEL: Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you? 
KEVIN: My tire blew out on the way here, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Huh? 
KEVIN: I almost died. I... I went into this skid--- 
MICHAEL: Pop quiz. 
KEVIN: ...What? 
MICHAEL: Why is today a special day? 
KEVIN: I almost died. 
MICHAEL: Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you... 
RYAN: You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class. 
MICHAEL: In business school, Kevin. Business school. 
KEVIN: Wow. 
RYAN: If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid not to do it, right? 
MICHAEL: A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us. 
MICHAEL: Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you? 
DWIGHT: "Don't be an idiot." Changed my life. 
DWIGHT: Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing. 
MICHAEL: Will they throw their hats, you think? 
RYAN: What? 
MICHAEL: A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air. 
RYAN: Y-You understand nobody's graduating. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for 
THAT: "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line. 
RYAN: ...It doesn't apply. 
MICHAEL: I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey! 
RYAN: Quit it! 
MICHAEL: We have fun. 
ROY: I can't for your art show tonight. 
PAM: Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio. 
ROY: I-I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
PAM: Thanks. 
PAM: I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy. 
ROY: Love ya. 
PAM: You too. 
JIM: Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on. 
KELLY: I can't believe you're back together with Roy! 
PAM: Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know. 
KELLY: Oh my God. You're so in love now. 
PAM: Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way. 
KELLY: Oh, art show! 
PAM: I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there. 
KELLY: ...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure. 
MICHAEL: Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class?  Whoo! College 
STUDENT: ....Dude. 
DWIGHT: ...Oh my God. Animal stool.  
PAM: Dwight, what are you doing? 
DWIGHT: Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you.  Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT! 
KAREN: Oh my God! 
DWIGHT: BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes! 
STANLEY: Goooood bye. 
ANGELA:  ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me... 
MICHAEL: Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now. 
RYAN: ...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off... 
MICHAEL: I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it. 
DWIGHT: We have... a bat... in the office. 
TOBY: The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open. 
ANGELA: Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop! 
JIM: Okay. Thanks.  Animal control will be here at six. 
DWIGHT: At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership. 
JIM: I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd... 
DWIGHT: What? What's so wierd? 
JIM: The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful...  Oh well. 
RYAN: And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of 
BUSINESS: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel. 
DWIGHT:  This is your job, Halpert. 
JIM: Ow! 
KAREN: Oh, what happened? 
JIM: That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot. 
KAREN: But Jim, this garlic bread is cold. 
JIM: What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre. 
DWIGHT: No... no. One crisis at a time. 
DWIGHT: If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ. 
MICHAEL: So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or...  a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand .  Satisfied? 
TOBY: Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it. 
PAM: Oh! No, you should go. 
TOBY: Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art. 
MICHAEL: Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies. 
RYAN: Michael. 
MICHAEL: ...And products! 
RYAN: What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing. 
MICHAEL: Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up. Business Student 
#1: Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world? 
MICHAEL: We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.  
KAREN: Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted. 
JIM: Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare. 
KAREN: What glare? 
JIM: The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding. 
DWIGHT: I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog. 
DWIGHT: Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance-- 
CREED: Sure. 
DWIGHT: --to use sudden violence. 
CREED: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake? 
CREED: What size? Business Student 
#2: What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain? 
MICHAEL: ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back. Business Student 
#2: Has anyone ever come back? 
MICHAEL: ...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid. Business Student 
#3: How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger? 
MICHAEL: Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index? Business Student 
#3: ...What? 
MICHAEL: Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here? Business Student 
#1: By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years. 
MICHAEL: ...Wait, Ryan said that? 
KELLY: What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat. 
CREED: Animals can't feel pain. 
KELLY: Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family! 
DWIGHT: Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW! 
KELLY: AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT! 
KEVIN:  I... am a hero! 
MICHAEL: Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay. Business Student 
#2: But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain? 
MICHAEL: David will always beat Goliath. Business Student 
#1: But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school? Business Student 
#1: But in the big picture... 
MICHAEL: Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT! 
RYAN: ...It wasn't personal. 
MICHAEL: Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things. 
RYAN: Pack my--? 
MICHAEL: You heard me, pack your things. 
MEREDITH: I really want to come out! 
CREED: Good night, Mary Beth! 
JIM: So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control? 
DWIGHT: Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six. 
JIM: Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Goodbye Jim. And good luck. 
DWIGHT: Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen. 
PAM: ...And it's all from the same series. 
WOMAN: Oh. 
PAM: Called 'Impressions.' 
WOMAN: Oh. 
PAM: Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se. 
WOMAN: Maybe one day. 
PAM: I hope so. 
WOMAN: Mmm. 
PAM: I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever.  Hey, babe, how are you? 
ROY: Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh? 
PAM: Hey, Kenny. 
KENNY: Hey Pam. 
ROY: How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh? 
DWIGHT: Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh!  
MEREDITH: Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me! 
DWIGHT: Hold still, woman! 
MEREDITH: Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh! 
DWIGHT: ... ... You're welcome. 
ROY: It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them. 
PAM: Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home. 
ROY: To my place? 
PAM: Maybe, I'm a little tired. 
ROY: Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art. 
PAM: Thank you. 
RYAN: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me. 
MICHAEL: Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex. 
RYAN: To the annex? Where... Kelly is? 
MICHAEL: A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business. 
OSCAR: You're the one who said we needed more culture. 
GIL: This is culture to you? 
OSCAR: It's her first try. 
GIL: Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants. 
OSCAR: Meaning what? 
GIL: Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty. 
OSCAR: Well, those aren't Pam's strong points. 
GIL: Yeah, exactly. That's why this is... motel art. 
ARTIST: Thanks for coming. 
MICHAEL: Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town. 
PAM: Oh, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Wow! You did these... freehand? 
PAM: Yep. 
MICHAEL: My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much? 
PAM: What do you mean? 
MICHAEL: I don't see a... price. 
PAM: Um... you wanna buy it? 
MICHAEL: Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car? 
PAM: Uh-huh. 
MICHAEL: That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you. 
PAM:  ... Thank you. 
MICHAEL: What? 
PAM: Do you have something in your pocket? 
MICHAEL: ...Chunky. Do you want half? 
PAM: No thank you. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera. 
KELLY: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God... 
RYAN: It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited. 
KELLY: I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't... 
MICHAEL: Can you confirm that the straps are tight? 
DWIGHT: Yes. But this  seems to be... 
MICHAEL: And now, the chains. 
MICHAEL: A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school. 
MICHAEL: MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.  Can he do it? I don't see how he can. 
DWIGHT: I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath. 
MICHAEL: No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE! 
JIM: Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you? 
MICHAEL: I will get out. Oh yes, I will. 
PAM: So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead? 
MICHAEL: No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go.  
MICHAEL: AHHHH! 
KEVIN: Is everything ok, Michael? 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
MICHAEL: I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key... 
MICHAEL: Alright. 
DWIGHT:  
MICHAEL: Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm. 
JIM: Another worm? Like, are they friends? 
DWIGHT: It's early bird gets the worm. 
MICHAEL: Pam, would you smell my breath? 
PAM: No, no. 
DWIGHT: Let me smell.  Good, not great. 
MICHAEL: "Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special. 
MICHAEL: Jimbo, last chance to carpool. 
JIM: Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car. 
MICHAEL: Sure? Might be a good idea. 
JIM: Yeah. 
MICHAEL: Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip. 
JIM: Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Play some games? 
JIM: Oh. Um. I think we're good. 
MICHAEL: I spy? 
JIM: Yeah. 
JIM: Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless? 
DWIGHT: Thanks for inviting me along. 
MICHAEL: Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going?  Heh-woh you. 
JAN: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Hey, Buttercup. 
JAN: Hi. 
MICHAEL: I am on my way. I should be there in about 15... 
JAN: Let's just blow this party off. 
MICHAEL: That's what she said. 
JAN: Am I on speaker phone? 
MICHAEL: Uh, yes you are. 
JAN: Is anybody else in the... 
DWIGHT: Hello, Jan. 
JAN: Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone. 
MICHAEL: No problem.  
JAN: Ok. Let's just go to a motel... 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
JAN: ...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I... 
JAN: Still on speaker? 
MICHAEL: Ummm... I don't know. 
JAN: Are camera's there? 
MICHAEL: Maybe. 
JAN: See you soon. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
DWIGHT: Talk to you later, Jan. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Bye. 
PAM: Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come. 
ROY: I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered. 
PAM: Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things. 
ROY: Ok. 
PAM: I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy. 
MICHAEL: Beauty. Thank you sir! 
DWIGHT: Salad. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: You dressed exactly like the servants. 
MICHAEL: Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me. 
DWIGHT: Wait. I don't think yours will fit me. 
MICHAEL: I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that. 
DWIGHT: That would have been really embarrassing. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
DWIGHT: Crisis averted. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
PAM: Oh, that duck is so cute. 
KEVIN: Hey Pam. 
PAM: Hey guys. 
KEVIN: Oscar. Angela. 
MICHAEL: Hi. 
MICHAEL: Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend. 
MICHAEL: Oh, um, potato salad. 
DWIGHT: It's from both of us. 
MICHAEL: No, it's not. 
RACHEL: Wonderful, let's, ah, see where we can put this. Ok. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here. 
MICHAEL: It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know. 
PAM: Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet? 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
KELLY: Oh my God, when is it? 
KEVIN: It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this. 
ROY: Hey. 
PAM: Hey. You made it. 
ROY: You said it was important, so... How's it going? 
KENNY: What's up, Pam. 
PAM: Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis. 
ROY: You guys, uh, want a round, on me? 
EVERYONE: Yeah. 
ROY: Yeah? Get you a drink. 
KENNY: Thanks man. 
ANGELA: No thank you, Roy. 
DWIGHT: Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces. 
MICHAEL: What are you looking for? You bring dip? 
JAN: I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR. 
MICHAEL: Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too. 
JAN: You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company. 
MICHAEL: Over our love. 
JAN: I've never told you that I love you. 
MICHAEL: You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all. 
JAN: I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star. 
JAN: What's this over the "i"? 
MICHAEL: It's a heart. 
JAN: Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying? 
MICHAEL: I love this woman! 
JAN: Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please. 
DWIGHT: Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica? Dan 
GORE: No. 
DWIGHT: No? Then you are an idiot. 
RACHEL: Hello Michael. 
MICHAEL: Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So... 
DAVID: Jan, glad you could make it. 
JAN: Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott? 
DAVID: Of course I do. 
JAN: From the Scranton Branch. 
MICHAEL: Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. 
JAN: David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please. 
RACHEL: Excuse me. 
MICHAEL: Ok. 
PAM:  Oh.  No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite. 
BARTENDER: Oh, sorry. 
MAN: So did the merger go smoothly, or? 
MICHAEL: It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them. 
KAREN: I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great? 
JAN: We're good.  Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok? 
RACHEL: Can I get anyone anything, or? 
MICHAEL: I could go for an appeteaser. 
JAN: Martini please. 
MICHAEL: Bagel bites or something. 
KAREN: Rachel, your house is beautiful. 
RACHEL: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: What's the square footage? 
DAVID: About 5,000. 
DWIGHT: Does that include the garage? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate. 
DWIGHT: I'm just... 
DAVID: I don't know 
DWIGHT: It's a common question. 
MICHAEL: David, how much did this house cost? 
DWIGHT: These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around. 
RACHEL: I'll show you around. 
DWIGHT: Cool, let's start with the banisters. 
KAREN: Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall? 
JIM: Yep. 
KAREN: That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date. 
JIM: Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me. 
KAREN: And it didn't end well. 
JIM: Gotcha. Alright. 
DAVID: This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch. 
MICHAEL: Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean.  
JAN: You ok? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Do you have any ice? 
DAVID: Sure. 
MICHAEL: How about some Splenda? 
ROY: One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here. 
KENNY: Where? 
ROY: On this side. 
KEVIN: No, it is definitely under one of these hands.  
RYAN: I think I heard it on Roy's side. 
KEVIN: No, it is here. 
RYAN:  Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here. 
KEVIN: Good thing you didn't listen to me. 
RYAN: Yeah, close one. 
ROY:  Not here. Not here. It's either here or here.  Not here. . 
KENNY: YES! 
PAM: Nice job. 
ROY: I can read you like a book. 
PAM: Oh yeah? 
ROY: You can't keep anything from me. Student 
1: Hey Creed. 
CREED: Hey! What are you guys doing here? Student 
2: You're the man buddy. 
CREED: I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station. 
DWIGHT: Huh.  Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? . 
RACHEL: Uh, that's a guest room. 
DWIGHT: Just the one window? 
RACHEL:  Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me. 
DWIGHT: Are those real pearls? 
RACHEL: Uh, yes. 
DWIGHT:  Good. 
JIM: Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care. 
KAREN: Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated. 
JIM: Oh. Hadn't noticed. 
KAREN: Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable. 
JIM: No, it was before I knew you so, its fine. 
MICHAEL: This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out. 
JAN: It's nice. 
MICHAEL: You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas. 
JAN: I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family. 
MICHAEL: Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo. 
JIM: Oh. 
MICHAEL: Crazy. 
JAN: I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes. 
MICHAEL: Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it? 
JAN: Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just.  
MICHAEL: What are you doing? 
JAN: Don't you know what I'm doing? 
MICHAEL: Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy. 
JAN: Shut up. 
MICHAEL: What has gotten into you? 
JAN: Come on. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. 
JAN: What? 
MICHAEL: Come on, let's go back to the party. 
JAN: Just let me loosen my dress. 
MICHAEL: Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan. 
JAN: Michael. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, means please don't. Please. 
JAN: Slam me up against the wall, right here. 
MICHAEL: I'm not going to slam you up against the wall. 
JAN: Oh, please. 
MICHAEL: You're acting inappropriate. Jan. 
JAN: Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out. 
TOBY: Here.  
PAM: Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you. 
TOBY: I was... 
PAM: Hey, don't you have a daughter? 
TOBY:  Yes. 
DWIGHT: Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair? 
CHILD: I don't know, it was here when I was born. 
DWIGHT: I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak? 
CHILD: I don't know. 
DWIGHT: What do you know? 
DAVID: God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes. 
JIM: You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace. 
KAREN: Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me. 
JIM: Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here?  Wow. Ok. You got me. 
KAREN: I so got you. 
JIM: So, none of them? 
KAREN: Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first. 
JIM: Really? 
KAREN: Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun. 
JIM: Ok. 
KAREN: Hey Jan. 
JAN: Not too good. 
RACHEL: Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad? 
MICHAEL: Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan. 
DAVID: What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael? 
JIM: I don't know. Where to begin? My ball. 
DWIGHT: The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party. 
ROY: What? 
PAM: I want us to make it. I want a fresh start. 
ROY: That's awesome. That's what I want. 
PAM: Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us. 
ROY: I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all. 
PAM: Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim. 
ROY: What? 
PAM: He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed. 
ROY: Jim came on to you? 
PAM: Just listen. 
ROY: No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening! 
PAM: Don't yell! 
ROY: Don't yell?! 
PAM: This is over. 
ROY: Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God! 
KENNY: Damn jet skis! 
MICHAEL: Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle... 
JAN: I feel sick. 
MICHAEL: You didn't have any of the potato salad did you? 
JAN: No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public. 
MICHAEL: Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. 
JAN: Please don't cry. 
MICHAEL: I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces. 
JAN: It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him. 
MICHAEL: I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling. 
JAN: I didn't mean it. I was... 
MICHAEL: Whatever. 
JAN: Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it. 
MICHAEL: That's all, you didn't mean it? 
JAN: That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it. 
MICHAEL: I love you, Jan. 
JAN: Ok. 
DWIGHT: Don't break up you guys, you're great together. 
ROY: Are they going to call the cops? 
KENNY: No, I paid them off. 
ROY: Jet ski money? 
KENNY: All of it. 
ROY: I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert. 
KAREN: So do you want to see it or not? 
JIM: I don't know. Feel like... Friday night crowds... 
KAREN: Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic. 
JIM: Agoraphobic? 
KAREN: Yeah. 
JIM: Really? 
KAREN: Yeah! You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend. 
JIM: Absolutely correct. 
KEVIN: Later, Jim. 
JIM: Kev, have a good weekend. 
KAREN: Bye. Ok, so this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up. 
JIM: Here we go... 
KAREN: ...and we're gonna go to dinner. 
JIM: Ok... 
KAREN: And then we're gonna go to the movies. 
JIM: Sounds good. 
ROY: Hey Halpert! 
JIM: Hey...  
PAM: ROY! 
KAREN:  
PAM: Roy don't!  
ROY:  Ahh God! 
DWIGHT: Pam, please call security! 
DWIGHT: Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?  
MICHAEL: No need for consternation, everything is under control. 
JAN: Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office! 
MICHAEL: It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled. 
JAN:  Is Toby there? 
MICHAEL: No... 
TOBY: I'm... here, Jan. 
JAN: Ok, what... what is the situation Toby? 
TOBY: Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company. 
JAN: Thank God. 
TOBY: Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his... 
MICHAEL: No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage. 
JAN: All right, well are you gonna take care of this? 
MICHAEL: Yeppers. 
JAN: What did I tell you about "yeppers?" 
MICHAEL: I don't... remember. 
JAN: I told you not to say it. Do you remember that? 
MICHAEL: Yeesh... 
PAM: I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked. 
JIM: I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars. 
JIM: Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you. 
DWIGHT: Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded. 
JIM: Okay. Um... Got you something. 
DWIGHT: Don't want it. 
JIM: You don't know what it is. 
DWIGHT: Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens. 
JIM: It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven. 
DWIGHT: No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes. 
OSCAR: Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up. 
KEVIN: Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight. 
OSCAR: It was crazy. 
ANGELA: You saw it? Describe it please. 
OSCAR: Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero. 
ANGELA: Oh... 
OSCAR: It was insane! 
ANGELA:  Well... good for Dwight. 
MICHAEL: Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you. 
JIM: Where'd you get that? 
MICHAEL: Wikipedia. 
MICHAEL: Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information. 
MICHAEL: Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise. 
JIM: Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise. 
MICHAEL: Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think...  that maybe you should...  
JIM: I can't hear you. 
MICHAEL: What I'm saying is that,  
JIM: Still nothin'. 
MICHAEL: Ok, see what I did? 
JIM: No. 
MICHAEL: By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position. 
JIM: Nice. 
MICHAEL: Ok, let's try another one. Um... 
JIM: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Walking out of the room unexpectedly. 
JIM: And what happens in this one? 
MICHAEL: It's a surprise. 
JIM: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Go ahead, ask me for a raise. 
JIM: Can I have a raise? 
MICHAEL:  
JIM:  Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher. 
MICHAEL: What? 
JIM: What? 
MICHAEL: No, what did you say? 
JIM: I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened. 
MICHAEL: Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna... 
DWIGHT: I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place. 
TOBY: Which is where? 
DWIGHT: Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end. 
TOBY: Thanks Dwight. 
KELLY: That is the bravest thing I have ever heard. 
RYAN: I can't imagine what I would have done. 
KELLY: I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed. 
RYAN: Well that was funny, that's why. 
KELLY: Oh it was? 
RYAN: Mm-hmm. 
KELLY: Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night... 
RYAN: Okay. 
KELLY: ...and you call me, to calm you down... 
RYAN: You know what? I didn't--- 
TOBY: Can you stop... 
KELLY: ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not. 
TOBY: There's a bunch of people back here, maybe... 
RYAN: Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night... 
TOBY: Guys... 
KELLY: I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you! 
TOBY: I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But, if he did intend that? Wow. Genius. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah. 
DARRYL: You ready for me? 
MICHAEL: Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat. 
DARRYL: Cool. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room. 
DARRYL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room. 
MICHAEL: Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off. 
MICHAEL: Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control. 
MICHAEL:  I am declining to speak first. 
DARRYL: Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now. 
DARRYL: Are you wearin' lady clothes? 
MICHAEL: What? 
DARRYL: Are you wearin' lady clothes? Those look like lady... pants. 
MICHAEL: No, this is a power suit. 
DARRYL: That there's a woman's suit. 
MICHAEL:  I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again. 
DARRYL: I'ma call Roy, man. 
MICHAEL: Ohh... kay. 
DARRYL: This is gonna make him feel better. 
MICHAEL: All right. 
DARRYL: This is too good. 
MICHAEL: Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit? 
PAM: Oh my God, that's a woman's suit! 
KEVIN: You're wearing a woman's suit? 
MICHAEL: No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin. 
MICHAEL: There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual. 
KEVIN: Who makes it? 
MICHAEL: Uh,  MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery. 
PHYLLIS: Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining? 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
PHYLLIS: Did you see... 
MICHAEL: Would you stop it, please? 
JIM: So, none of that tipped you off? 
MICHAEL: It's European, OK? It's a European cut. 
PAM: Michael, the pants don't have any pockets. 
MICHAEL: No, they don't. See?  
PAM:  
MICHAEL: Italians don't wear pockets. 
PAM: It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little. 
KAREN: Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet? 
MICHAEL: No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway. 
DARRYL: Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton. 
MICHAEL: Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes. 
DARRYL: Okay, can you just stand right there?  I gotta send some e-mails. 
MICHAEL: Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes. 
KEVIN: Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman? 
KAREN: I feel great, Kevin. Thank you. 
STANLEY: You must have been scared out of your mind. 
KAREN: Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared. 
ANGELA: What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story. 
KAREN: Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry. 
ANGELA: Mm-hmm. 
KAREN: And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt. 
ANGELA:  Goodness. 
KAREN: When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more. 
MICHAEL: Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise. 
DARRYL: Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise. 
MICHAEL:  
DARRYL: What? I can't hear you. 
MICHAEL:  That was a very good point. 
DARRYL: I can't--- what, Mike? Are you--- 
MICHAEL:  You make a very compelling argument. 
PAM: Sorry I almost got you killed. 
JIM: Yeah, that was nuts. 
PAM: He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right? 
JIM: No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection. 
PAM: Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now. 
JIM: We'll see. I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday. 
PAM: Jim... I am really... sorry. 
JIM: Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it. 
MICHAEL: I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me. 
DARRYL: Why can't I just... tell you? 
MICHAEL: Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films.  No, slide--- slide it, yes. 
DARRYL: There you go. 
MICHAEL: Oh.  Come on. Be serious. 
DARRYL: I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want. 
MICHAEL: I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much. 
DARRYL: Come on, be for real Mike. 
MICHAEL: I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub. 
DARRYL:  Are you serious? You're earning this? 
MICHAEL: Plus perks, yes. 
DARRYL: Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog.  
MICHAEL: Fourteen years. 
DARRYL: Ho-ho! 
MICHAEL: No, please, please... 
DARRYL: Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  Ah.  
MICHAEL: Ok, let's take 15, again. 
MICHAEL: A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that. 
JIM: Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something. 
DWIGHT: When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer? 
JIM: Boy I--- 
DWIGHT: No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle? 
JIM: It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating. 
KAREN: Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks. 
JIM: Well... yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do? 
KAREN: Hmm... I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip. 
KEVIN: Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you. 
MICHAEL: Oh, thank you. 
KEVIN: Yeah. I heard you might need it. So... 
CREED: Here's the $40 you gave me. 
MICHAEL: I didn't give you $40. 
CREED: In a way you did. 
STANLEY: Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid. 
DARRYL:  Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know.  Ok, alright. I gotta go. Later.  
MICHAEL: Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia. 
DARRYL: What? 
MICHAEL: I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise. 
DARRYL: That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss. 
MICHAEL: Well what am I supposed to do? 
DARRYL: Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son. 
MICHAEL: I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous. 
DARRYL: Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay, and we're shippin' more now than we ever have. 
MICHAEL:  That's true. 
DARRYL: Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I should. 
DARRYL: Yeah, you should. 
MICHAEL: I have been a loyal employee for a long time. 
DARRYL: Fourteen years long. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I deserve a bump. 
DARRYL: Make it happen, cap'in. 
MICHAEL: I am makin' it happen, sergeant. 
CREED: I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30. Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  Something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter--- 
ANGELA: You're useless. 
JAN: Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends? 
MICHAEL: No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today. 
JAN: Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five? 
MICHAEL: Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away. 
JAN: Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I'm bringing Darryl. 
JAN: Da--- Darryl from the warehouse? 
MICHAEL: Mm-hm. 
JAN: No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep. So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby. 
MICHAEL: Hey, I'd rather kill myself. 
JAN: Michael, he's your branch's HR rep... 
MICHAEL:  No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known. 
JAN: ...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship. You know this. Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it. 
MICHAEL:  Fine. 
KELLY: You are so mean. 
RYAN: I don't know what you're talking about. 
KELLY: Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid. 
RYAN: No, I said your idea was stupid. 
MICHAEL: Toby, come on. Let's go. 
TOBY: Where? 
MICHAEL: Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go. 
KELLY: What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher? 
TOBY: Alright. 
KELLY: Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor. 
RYAN: Don't you see why that's insane? 
KELLY: Oh, so I'm crazy now? 
DARRYL: Comfortable, Mike? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Fine. 
DARRYL: How about you, man. Comfortable? 
TOBY: No. 
MICHAEL:  Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker. Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way. 
DARRYL: Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Well... 
DARRYL: I haven't been to New York in a long time. 
MICHAEL: Mm, the Big Apple. 
DARRYL: Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there. 
TOBY: How would we get home? 
DARRYL: Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place. 
MICHAEL: Maybe I'll stay. 
DARRYL: Mm, it's not that big. 
MICHAEL: Well... 
DARRYL: Busses, though. They get you home quick. 
MICHAEL:  Oh, I... 
KELLY: And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like "No!" 
ANGELA: Then what'd he do?  
KELLY: You should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories.  Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly. Oh yeah I could totally help you with that. Ok, let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams... 
HUNTER: Hey guys, Jan is ready for you. 
DARRYL: Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you. 
MICHAEL: Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity. 
DARRYL: Yes sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me 
MICHAEL: All right. 
DARRYL: Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself. 
ROY:  Hey man, uh... I'm sorry.   Thanks.  Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something? 
PAM: I don't know. 
ROY: Please. I just got some stuff I gotta say to you.  
KEVIN:  Jim--- Roy--- Look out! 
JIM: Thanks, Kev. I'm good though. 
JAN: Thank you, Hunter.  Hello. Come in.  Ah, Okay. 
MICHAEL: Who's the boy toy? 
JAN: That's my new assistant. 
MICHAEL: Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek? 
JAN: I have to call you the second I get a new assistant? 
MICHAEL: Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers. 
TOBY: Hi, Jan. 
JAN: Hi, Toby.  First---  First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear? 
MICHAEL: Pippity poppity. 
JAN: Right now we can offer you a 6% raise. 
MICHAEL: Six percent? After all we've been through? 
JAN: Oh, God. 
MICHAEL: I got you... jade earrings. 
JAN: Michael--- 
MICHAEL: No! 
JAN: Michael--- 
MICHAEL: No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more sex.   What are you writing, perv-ball? 
TOBY: Just preparing for the deposition. 
TOBY: This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial. 
ROY: I'm so sorry, Pammy. I really wasn't gonna do anything. But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and... I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong. 
PAM: I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices. 
ROY: So you gonna start datin' Halpert then? 
PAM: Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend. 
ROY: Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy. 
PAM: No, there were a lot of reasons. 
ROY: But you're not even gonna try to go out with him?  I don't get you Pam. 
PAM: I know. 
DWIGHT: What's this? 
JIM: What's what? 
DWIGHT: Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. "Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute" 
JIM: Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor. 
DWIGHT: Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap. 
JIM:  Didn't think you'd notice... 
MICHAEL: Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me! 
JAN: Okay, Michael. Please, why don't we just take a break. This is really going nowhere. 
MICHAEL: Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere. 
JAN: Ok, Toby, how about if you... 
TOBY: Sure. 
JAN: Great. 
JAN: What's wrong with you? 
MICHAEL: Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I--- 
JAN: Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15. 
MICHAEL: Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make--- 
JAN: No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it. Okay? 
MICHAEL: Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise. 
JAN: No. But we can offer you 12. 
MICHAEL: But you just said 15. 
MICHAEL: Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having sex with Jan-- 
JAN: Michael! 
STANLEY: So you and Bob are looking at a historical house? 
PHYLLIS: Mm-hmm, near the river. 
STANLEY: Mm, how many bedrooms? 
PHYLLIS: Four. 
ANGELA: Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading. 
DWIGHT: Really? 
ANGELA: Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery. 
DWIGHT: Mm, good stuff. 
ANGELA: Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together. 
DWIGHT: Sounds... fun.  
JIM:  I... will never say a word. And now, we are even. 
ANDY: I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back. Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  So look out Dunder Mifflin!   I mean, look out... in a fun way! You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you... 
ANDY: Hey guys! Guess who's back!  AHHH!  OH, GOD! 
DWIGHT: No need to thank me. 
DWIGHT: I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro, from Heroes. That's a hero. Also, Bono. 
ANDY: Good morning, Pam. 
PAM: Oh, welcome back, Andy. 
ANDY: Drew. I'm Drew now. 
PAM: Oh. Drew. Sorry. 
ANDY: Apology not... accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place.  
ANDY: Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident.  But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies. 
ANDY: Mornin' Jim. 
JIM: Hey, Andy. How are you, man? 
ANDY: Good. Drew. 
JIM: What's that? 
ANDY: Dr--- You can call me Drew. 
JIM: No, I'm not gonna call you that. 
ANDY: Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what I do. 
JIM: Andy. 
ANDY: Drew.  Dwight. How's it goin' man? 
DWIGHT: Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna. 
DWIGHT: Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned. 
JIM: Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug. 
DWIGHT: Ok, tell him that's not true. 
JIM: Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks. 
ANDY: You guys... 
DWIGHT: Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him! 
JIM:  Andy! Nah, that's too far. 
DWIGHT: Damn you. 
MICHAEL: Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity. 
DARRYL: Now, this is the forklift. You need---  You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workers can't drive it. ... Quiz! Mike. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. 
DARRYL: Should you drive the forklift? 
MICHAEL: I can, and I have. 
DARRYL: No! No no no no no! I said should you. You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift, you understand? 
LONNY: You're not allowed to drive the forklift. 
DARRYL: It's not safe, you don't have a license. 
MICHAEL: Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  Pudge has driven the forklift. 
MADGE: Madge. 
MICHAEL: I thought your name was Pudge? 
MADGE: No, it's always been Madge. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Um, her. 
DARRYL: Her. Yes, "her" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay? 
MICHAEL: Ah, fine. 
DARRYL: Do you understand that? 
MICHAEL: Yeeesh. 
DARRYL: We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled... 
MICHAEL:  "Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!"  
DARRYL: And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers. 
DARRYL: The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat. 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
ANDY: It's on! 
DARRYL: How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler? 
MICHAEL: Bail'er? I hardly know her. 
LONNY: Dammit, Michael. Pay attention, man. 
DARRYL: Anybody wanna take a guess? Anybody? 
KEVIN: Five bucks says it's over 50. 
JIM: You really wanna bet? 
DARRYL: Anybody? 
KEVIN: Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored. 
GUY: How many? 
JIM: Ok, you're on. 
DARRYL: Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them? 
KEVIN:  Damn... 
DARRYL:  You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful... 
JIM: No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'. 
KEVIN: On what? 
JIM: I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out. 
KEVIN: Nice. 
OSCAR: What are you guys talkin' about? 
DARRYL: These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers, Michael, should not go anywhere near them. 
MICHAEL: Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody... 
DARRY: It would be the worst thing in the world! It would! Very much so. 
LONNY: What the hell is wrong with this man? 
MICHAEL: It's a big red trash compactor! 
LONNY: What are you--- 
DARRYL: It's not a trash compactor! It's a baler! 
LONNY: Don't disrespect the baler! 
MICHAEL: Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions... 
DARRYL: No do not touch it! 
MICHAEL: ...would I go near--- 
DARRYL: There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay? 
MICHAEL: Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go! 
TOBY: Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour. 
MICHAEL: Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and... 
TOBY: Um, yeah. You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour. 
MICHAEL: Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour? 
DARRYL: Take them at the same time. 
MICHAEL: Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not? 
TOBY: No, no. Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty. 
RYAN: What about a long sleeve T? 
TOBY: Well, that'll work. 
KEVIN: Long johns? A shaw? 
TOBY: You know, anything that warms you. 
MICHAEL: Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  Sorry, he is very lame.  Um, let's see. "Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter." 
DARRYL: Thank God we only had a baler to deal with. 
LONNY: Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it? 
MICHAEL: Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation. 
DARRYL: Actually, you did. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---" 
TOBY: Sedentary. 
MICHAEL: Yes. "Which can contribute to heart disease." Heart disease kills more people that balers. 
LONNY: That's called having a fat butt, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary... 
LONNY: Yeah, yeah. That's, that's fat butt disease. That's what you suffer from? 
MICHAEL: No. 
LONNY: Fat butt disease, Michael? 
KELLY: Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds. 
LONNY: Yeah? I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you? 
KELLY: Ryan? 
LONNY: Dude, tell your girl to shut up. 
KELLY: What?! 
RYAN: Kelly, you insulted the gentleman. Please apologize. 
KELLY: Are you kidding me? 
DARRYL: Alright, we outta here. 
MICHAEL: Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I--- 
LONNY: Yeah, but ours was real, Michael. 
DARRYL: That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin' on your biscuit. Never havin' to risk it. 
MICHAEL: Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore? 
MICHAEL: Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I... "Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today." ... This is one example. 
KEVIN:  Ten. 
OSCAR: Really, ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant. 
JIM: There's like ten green ones. 
OSCAR: Forty-two. 
JIM: I'm gonna say fifty. 
KAREN: Fifty-one. 
JIM: Oh, don't be that person. 
KEVIN: That is lame. 
KAREN: It's a strategy! 
PAM: It's called being smart. 
KAREN: Thank you. 
KEVIN: Oh, geeze. 
PAM: I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun. 
PAM: Ten... 
JIM: Kev's out. 
KEVIN: Damn it. 
PAM: 47, 48, 49! Jim wins! 
EVERYONE: Oooh!  
KEVIN: That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you. Hours and hours. 
JIM: Okay, okay. 
KEVIN: No, constantly. Like, for years. 
JIM: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right? 
PAM: I don't understand the question. 
MICHAEL: Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff. 
PAM: Yeah... 
MICHAEL: I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that... 
PAM: It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals. 
MICHAEL: Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science. 
PAM: So, you're okay? 
MICHAEL: Indubitably. 
MICHAEL: They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes. 
DWIGHT: Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!? 
MICHAEL: I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression--- 
DWIGHT: Wolves. 
MICHAEL: Nn--- Depression. 
DWIGHT: Visual aids. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
DWIGHT: A quilt. Depression quilt? 
MICHEAL: No time to sew a quilt. ... I got it. Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store. 
MICHAEL: You may be asking yourself, "What am I doing on a trampoline?" Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, "Hey! You ever seen a suicide?" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side 
NOTE: They might think "Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael." But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  
KELLY: So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, number three becomes number two, etc, etc. And let's just say that I just sent back Love Actually, which was awesome.  And they sent me Uptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see love actually again,  but it's at the bottom of the que! Oh no, what do I do!?  What I do, is this. I go online, I go click, click, click. And I change the order of the que, so that I can see Love Actually  as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works?  
RYAN: I guess I forgot.  
KELLY: You're such a ditz. 
KEVIN: Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said "awesome" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies. 
DWIGHT:  Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops! 
MICHAEL: Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or... 
DWIGHT: We measured it once... 
MICHAEL: Go buy some watermelons. 
DWIGHT: Seedless? 
MICHAEL: Just... 
TOBY:  Creed is eating an apple. I found a potato. 
PAM: Hey Creed. 
CREED: Hey! 
PAM: Hey. 
CREED: Hello.  
PAM: Yes! 
KEVIN: Here you go.  
TOBY: Nice. 
KAREN: I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out. 
DWIGHT: Ready? 
MICHAEL: Let's do it! Drop that sucker. 
DWIGHT:  
MICHAEL: BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess. 
DWIGHT: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes. 
DWIGHT: Got it. 
MICHAEL: Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler. 
DWIGHT: We're not allowed to use the baler. 
MICHAEL: Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster. 
DWIGHT: I'm on it! 
DWIGHT: I'm temporarily lifting the shun. 
ANDY: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: It means nothing. I need you to do something for me. 
ANDY: Anything. 
DWIGHT: Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle. 
ANDY: You mean a moon bounce. 
DWIGHT: What do you think? You've got an hour. 
ANDY: I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash. 
DWIGHT: Shunning resumed. 
ANDY: Do you, do you want a drawbridge? 
DWIGHT: Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun. 
DWIGHT: Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision. 
MICHAEL: Yes, thank you for seeing that. 
DWIGHT: When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults. 
MICHAEL: I don't know if I wanna do this. 
DWIGHT: Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk! 
MICHAEL: No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking. 
DWIGHT: That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll! 
MICHAEL: Rock n' roll! 
DWIGHT: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: That's right! I am not thinking. 
DWIGHT:  Near near near near near! 
MICHAEL: Yes! Yeah! 
DWIGHT:  Michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof! 
MICHAEL: Woo! 
DWIGHT:  Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss! 
MICHAEL: Woo! 
DWIGHT:  Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun! 
MICHAEL: I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point!  
DWIGHT:  Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange! 
ANDY: Whoa! What's the situation? 
DWIGHT:  Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun. 
ANDY: Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end? 
DWIGHT: Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die! 
STANLEY: Is it nice outside? 
DWIGHT: It's gorgeous. Let's go! 
STANLEY: Do I need my jacket? 
DWIGHT: No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on! 
RYAN: Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T? 
DWIGHT: Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go! 
DWIGHT:  Come on, hurry up you guys! 
MICHAEL:  My life! Oh, my life... 
DWIGHT:  Michael, what's wrong?! 
MICHAEL: Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression. 
DWIGHT: Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study! 
DWIGHT: Is that the last year the data was available? 
MICHAEL: Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil! 
DWIGHT: Don't do anything rash! 
MICHAEL: Wait, where are the warehouse guys? 
DWIGHT: I didn't...  I didn't think you needed them for this part. 
MICHAEL: Okay... that's... 
DWIGHT: you said to just... 
MICHAEL: That's the whole point, dummy. 
DWIGHT: Okay, I'm on it! 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DWIGHT: Attention blue collar workers! 
PAM: What are the odds that this is in any way real? 
JIM: I'd say like... 10,000 to 1? 
KEVIN: Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds. 
KEVIN: If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a very rich dude. 
DWIGHT: Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange! 
MICHAEL: Oooooh, my life! 
DWIGHT: Michael! What's wrong? 
MICHAEL: Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed. 
DWIGHT: Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? 
MICHAEL: Dwight, you ignorant slut. 
JIM: Well, you know, the first performance was a little off. But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show. Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee. 
MICHAEL: And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof! 
JIM: Oh, excuse me. It's my... favorite part. 
ANGELA: This is just offensive. 
RYAN: At least we're outside. 
CREED:  Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there. 
JIM: Oh my God, there is a castle. 
DWIGHT: No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Damn it. 
PAM: Oh... God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump. 
JIM: Oh. He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself. 
PAM: Yeah... 
JIM: Hey uh, Michael. Don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured. 
PAM: Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it. 
MICHAEL: What is it? 
PAM: Come down and... open it and you'll see. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, find out what the present is. 
DWIGHT: Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing. 
JIM: Dwight... 
PAM: Dwight, what are you--- 
DWIGHT: Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it? 
DARRYL: Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself. 
MICHAEL: You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life. 
DARRYL: Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for. 
MICHAEL: What do I have to live for? 
DARRYL: A lot... of things. Uh, you, uh... What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's goin' good, right? 
MICHAEL: It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be. 
DARRYL: Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean, it takes courage just to be you. To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you. 
MICHAEL: Do you really mean that? 
DARRYL: I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong. And I ain't that brave. 
MICHAEL: I'm braver than you? 
DARRYL: Way braver! You Braveheart, man. 
MICHAEL: I Braveheart. I am. 
DARRYL: Come down, okay? 
MICHAEL: Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present. 
MICHAEL: An office... is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say. But, yes. 
JIM:  It's kind of blurry.  That's better.  Question. What kind of bear is best? 
DWIGHT: That's a ridiculous question. 
JIM: False. Black bear. 
DWIGHT: Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought--- 
JIM: Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica. 
DWIGHT: Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?! 
JIM: Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of...  eleven dollars. 
DWIGHT: You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you.  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year! 
JIM: ... MICHAEL! 
DWIGHT: Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL! 
PAM:  Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations? 
JIM:  Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this. 
PHYLLIS:  I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this. 
STANLEY:  I am upset. Don't I sound upset? 
MICHAEL:  It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper. 
MICHAEL: We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing... unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan. 
MICHAEL: Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime. 
DWIGHT: Cri-Man-Squa? 
MICHAEL: Crisis Management Squad. 
RYAN: F and C, doubletime? 
MICHAEL: Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions? 
JIM: One more. Why are you talking like that? 
MICHAEL: To save time, Jim. 
KAREN: Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time. 
PAM: Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time. 
MICHAEL: You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed? 
CREED: Here. 
MICHAEL: Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy. 
CREED: Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens. 
MICHAEL: We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today. 
OSCAR: That's really not our job. 
MICHAEL: Midnight, Oscar! Don't worry, Kelly will be training you first. 
ANGELA: Kelly's training us? 
KELLY: This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. This day is bananas! B-A-N-A- 
ANGELA:  I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing. 
MICHAEL: Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids. 
JIM: Yeah, I gotta call out on that. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person. 
JIM: All right. 
MICHAEL: I want you to bring a partner. 
RYAN: I'll go. 
MICHAEL: No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go. 
ANDY:  William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do. 
JIM: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone. 
MICHAEL: No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference. 
DWIGHT: Yes! You are entering the "No Spin Zone!" 
PAM: We're having a press conference? 
MICHAEL: No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves. 
DWIGHT: Not!  
MICHAEL: Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J. 
MICHAEL: I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story. 
JIM: Oh, did the press ask for a story? 
MICHAEL: Here is your headline. "Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done." Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go! 
CREED: Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect. 
CREED: The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did... when I was a homeless man. 
KELLY: Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.  
OSCAR: I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls. 
KELLY: I know, right? Probably a lot. 
ANGELA: Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go? 
KELLY: OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say "Customer Service, this is Kelly!" Except don't say "Kelly," say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones,  and I talked like this for the whole conversation! 
KEVIN: Oh! Can I be  Australian, mate? 
KELLY:  Absolutely! 
KEVIN:  'ello, mate! 
KELLY:  I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend. 
KEVIN:  I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies. 
ANDY: Beer me! 
JIM: What's that? 
ANDY: Hand me that water. I always say "Beer me." Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name? 
JIM: You know her name. 
ANDY: Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'? 
JIM: It's fine. 
ANDY: Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet. 
JIM: What about music? Do you have any music? 
ANDY: Uh, yeah. Should have said so.  Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa-- 
JIM: I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD. 
ANDY: Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc. 
JIM: Lord, beer me strength. 
ANDY: So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay? 
JIM: Did that really need to be said? 
ANDY: Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation. 
ANDY: Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here? 
JIM: Oh, is she that teacher in the white? 
ANDY: No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef. 
JIM: Which one... is she? 
ANDY: The one in the green hoodie. 
JIM: Wow. 
ANDY: I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something? 
JIM: No, I don't think so. 
ANDY: She's like, probably a tutor. 
JIM: Nope. 
ANDY: She probably a t-- 
JIM: No. 
ANDY: Sh--- 
JIM: No. 
MICHAEL: OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice. 
DWIGHT: On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair. 
DWIGHT: First rule in road-side beet 
SALES: Put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, "Wow, I need this beet right now." Those are the money beets. 
DWIGHT:   Hey!  Look sharp!  Hey! Uh, Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute. Chad 
LITE: Hi, uh--- 
DWIGHT: And you must be uh, from the Washington Post. Chad 
LITE: Scranton Times. Chad Lite, "Lighter Side of Life." 
DWIGHT: And "Breaking Corporate News." Chad 
LITE: And obits. 
DWIGHT: Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance. Chad 
LITE: Oh... 
DWIGHT: Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage? Chad 
LITE: Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh--- 
DWIGHT:  Great. 
JIM: Oh, Andy. You know what? We don't have a lot of time, so we should probably... 
ANDY: Jamie! 
JIM: Andy--- Ohh... 
ANDY: What are you doing here? 
JAMIE: Andy? 
ANDY: Are you a student here? 
JAMIE: Oh... yeah... 
ANDY: You never told me you were in high-school! 
JAMIE: This is weird. I... gotta go to Spanish. 
ANDY: OH MY GOD! 
JIM: Oh my God. 
ANDY: I had no idea. 
JIM: Well... that's not gonna hold up in court. 
ANDY: Huh... We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends. 
KEVIN:  Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I am so sorry. 
OSCAR:  Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale. 
ANGELA:  Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me.  
KELLY: OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing sooo good. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing? 
CREED: When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment. 
DWIGHT: Emergency dentist appointment. 
CREED: Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would have caught this. 
PAM: Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye. 
BARBARA: Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott. 
MICHAEL: Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really. 
MICHAEL: And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first. 
DWIGHT:  You look good in this. 
MICHAEL: So, let us consider this matter ended. 
BARBARA: Well it isn't ended. I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business. 
MICHAEL: I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry. 
BARBARA: I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying. 
MICHAEL: Well, we are extremely sorry. 
BARBARA: I don't accept. School 
OFFICIAL: I'll be with you in a moment. 
JIM: All right. 
ANDY: Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker. 
JIM: Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony. 
ANDY: But who was that guy? 
JIM: Probably another high-school student. School 
OFFICIAL: The issue with the watermark is very serious. 
JIM: Absolutely. School 
OFFICIAL: We teach our students that character counts. 
JIM: And you should. School 
OFFICIAL: But--- 
ANDY:  Pfft. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is a bitch. 
JIM: Andy... is having a real rough day today. 
ANDY: I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words--- 
JIM: "Good luck." 
ANDY: That's not what I had in mind. 
KELLY: Ask where he's from. 
ANGELA:  Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want?  He's upset about the watermark. 
KELLY: OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry. 
ANGELA:  It was an unfortunate error. We're fixing it. And you already got your money back... 
KELLY: And you're sorry. 
ANGELA: ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not.   I think he had Tourette's or something! 
MICHAEL: We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again. 
BARBARA: Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me. 
MICHAEL: The watermark... it's a one time thing. 
BARBARA: I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having sex? 
DWIGHT: May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling. 
MICHAEL: OK... 
DWIGHT: I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right. 
MICHAEL: What... can I do, for you? 
BARBARA: I, for starters, I think that you should resign. 
MICHAEL: Well...  OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill--- 
BARBARA: You're the head--- 
MICHAEL: The guys at the papermill--- No no no! 
BARBARA: You're the head of the company! 
MICHAEL: I'm the head of the company?! 
BARBARA: Yes, and that makes it your responsibility--- 
MICHAEL: No, I'm a regional manager--- 
BARBARA: And so you should lose your job! 
MICHAEL: No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out! 
BARBARA: Fine. 
MICHAEL: That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it. 
BARBARA: Mm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: It's non-transferable... 
MICHAEL: Doesn't matter. Out please! 
BARBARA: I'm calling the Better Business Bureau. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that? Chad 
LITE: Everything. 
MICHAEL: We gotta do something.  This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not... 
PAM: It's just the Scranton Times... 
MICHAEL: No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it... 
PAM: You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two. 
MICHAEL: You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  Do you know what this is for? 
PAM: Yes. 
PAM: Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch. 
MICHAEL:  OK, I think that's good. 
MICHAEL: "Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that." 
DWIGHT: Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team. 
MICHAEL: That's how devoted I am to this job. 
DWIGHT: I'm just saying... 
MICHAEL: I know. 
DWIGHT: They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade. 
MICHAEL: I understand that, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb. 
MICHAEL: Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut? 
DWIGHT: Cut. 
MICHAEL: So I'll know where--- 
PAM: Cut. 
MICHAEL: I'm asking Pam to do it, please. 
PAM: Cut. 
MICHAEL: OK, ready? 
ANGELA: Kevin, what's four plus seven? 
KEVIN:  Eleven. 
ANGELA: Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form. 
KEVIN: Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial. 
OSCAR:  Yes.  
ANGELA: You two are apes. 
OSCAR: I expect you to apologize for that, Angela. 
ANGELA: I'm sorry... that you're both morons. 
KEVIN: Oh, but you still said "I'm sorry." 
ANGELA: I called you morons. 
KEVIN: Still said it. 
OSCAR: Still said it, so...  
MICHAEL: Five, four, three. "There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day." 
PAM: One day for what? 
MICHAEL: That's... they always give an ultimatum. 
PAM: OK. 
MICHAEL: Good, cut? 
PAM: Cut. That was your best apology video ever. 
MICHAEL: Thought so too. 
CREED:  Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her. She's got some children. 
CREED: I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic. 
JIM: You want music? 
ANDY: I don't care. 
JIM: Come on man, just give it a couple days. I think you'll be all right. 
ANDY: Yeah. 
JIM:  A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... 
ANDY: You know what--- I don't--- 
JIM: A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... 
ANDY:  Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! 
JIM: A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... 
ANDY: Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! 
JIM: A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... 
ANDY: Sweet. 
DWIGHT:  Pam. 
PAM: Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today. 
DWIGHT:  Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen. 
KAREN: Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend? 
JIM: Do you? 
KAREN: No. 
JIM: OK. 
KAREN: I'm good. Thanks. 
JIM:  Look at that. 
DWIGHT: I'm Jim Halpert.  
JIM: Spot on. 
DWIGHT: Ah-luh-luh, a little comment. Muh. 
JIM:  Hey. 
JIM:  Oh, what's this? 
DWIGHT: That is a demerit. 
JIM:  "Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already. 
DWIGHT: You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law. 
JIM: Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean? 
DWIGHT:  Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those. 
JIM: Lay it on me. 
DWIGHT: Three demerits and you'll receive a citation. 
JIM: Now that sounds serious. 
DWIGHT: Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior. 
JIM: Which would be me. 
DWIGHT: That is correct. 
JIM: OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation. 
DWIGHT: What's a dis... what's that? 
JIM: Oh, you don't want to know. 
PAM:  Hey, Phyllis. You all right? 
PHYLLIS: I think I just got flashed. 
PAM: What? Really? 
PHYLLIS: In the parking lot. 
PAM: Oh, my God. 
DWIGHT:  Move! 
JIM: OK, I'll call the real police. 
ANDY: What happened? What can I do to help? 
JIM:  OK. 
ANDY: I'll check the web. 
JIM:  Thank you.  The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls. 
PAM:  Can you tell us what happened? 
PHYLLIS: Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map. 
ANGELA: Phyllis. You're a married woman. 
CREED: The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss? 
CREED: If that's flashing, then lock me up. 
PAM:  It's just, like, so creepy. 
RYAN:  Yeah.  
MICHAEL: What's happening? 
PAM: Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot. 
MICHAEL: Really? Is she OK? 
PAM: Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down. 
MICHAEL: OK.  Phyllis, you say?  Hmm.  
ANGELA: What is so funny? 
MICHAEL: Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind? 
KEVIN: I'm guessing not. 
MICHAEL:  I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it. 
JIM: Mm... not really, no. 
PAM: It's disgusting and demeaning. 
MICHAEL: Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?  OK.  He's back!  OK. Hmm.  Waagh!  
TOBY: Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the... 
MICHAEL: What? Oh.  
TOBY: What's going on? 
MICHAEL: Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh...  
TOBY: I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response. 
MICHAEL: Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul. 
TOBY: I don't think the women in this office - 
MICHAEL: Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher. 
TOBY: I was at a parent-teacher conference. 
MICHAEL: Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis.  I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong. 
MICHAEL: In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me. 
JAN:  Michael, ... 
MICHAEL: Huh? 
JAN: ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body. 
MICHAEL: I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls - 
JAN: I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser. 
MICHAEL: Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable. 
JAN: $300? 
MICHAEL: I... uh, well, I don't know. 
JAN: You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on? 
HUNTER:  You got it, Jan. 
DWIGHT: Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free. 
MICHAEL:  I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house. 
DWIGHT: Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on. 
MICHAEL: OK. 
DWIGHT:  There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert. 
MICHAEL: This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: Look at that one. 
MICHAEL: Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid.  
MICHAEL: Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say. 
DWIGHT: Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force. 
JIM:  Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces? 
DWIGHT: 
ANSWER: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking.  Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community? 
PAM: Phallus? 
DWIGHT: Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody. 
PAM: I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year.  Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things. 
PHYLLIS: I didn't really get a good look. 
PAM: That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones. 
KAREN: Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out?  "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute." This is ridiculous. 
DWIGHT: Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen. 
KAREN: Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting. 
DWIGHT: Desperate times call for desperate measures. 
PAM:  "Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors." Nobody dress like that.  
MICHAEL: OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that. 
KAREN: Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect. 
MICHAEL: See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight? 
DWIGHT: Yes. Did you hear that, Michael? 
MICHAEL: No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation. 
JIM: Wait a second, how are you qualified for that? 
MICHAEL: Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one? 
DWIGHT:  Mm, less than three. 
MICHAEL: That is not current. 
DWIGHT: You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual. 
JIM: Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls. 
DWIGHT: Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women. 
MICHAEL: I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter. 
CREED: Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal? 
MICHAEL: Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited. 
MEREDITH: I don't remember doing that. 
ANGELA: What a surprise. 
MICHAEL: OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie. 
DWIGHT: Alien. Blagh! 
MICHAEL: What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not.  Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this. 
ANDY: If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models. 
KEVIN: Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me. 
KAREN: What you're saying is extremely misogynistic. 
MICHAEL: Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything. 
KAREN: I'm saying that you're being sexist. 
MICHAEL: No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist. 
KAREN: That - it's the same thing. 
PHYLLIS: Michael. 
MICHAEL: Yes. 
PHYLLIS: When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian. 
MICHAEL: Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut. 
ANGELA: And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods. 
MICHAEL: I have to know whether you're serious or not. 
DWIGHT: I wish I could menstruate. 
DWIGHT: If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides. 
KAREN: Can we just get back to work? 
MICHAEL: Ye - OK, yes. 
ANGELA: This is not work talk. 
MICHAEL: You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.  
KAREN: Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that. 
ANGELA: Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10. 
MICHAEL: OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder.  Let's go! 
DWIGHT: Have you finished with the sketch? 
PAM: Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Hmm, doesn't seem like the type. 
PAM: Uh, Phyllis got a good look. 
DWIGHT: Hmm. 
DWIGHT:  I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide. 
PAM:  Oh. 
ANGELA: Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead. 
MEREDITH: Thanks. I know how to drive.  
PAM: Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter. 
MEREDITH: My car, my rules. 
KEVIN: Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom? 
JIM: No. Thank you, though. 
KEVIN: You aren't curious? 
JIM: Not really. I've seen a bathroom before. 
KEVIN: Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy. 
JIM: I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it. 
KEVIN:  Yeah. I'm going in. 
JIM: Go crazy. 
KEVIN:  Oh... my... God. 
ANDY: I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today. 
DWIGHT: Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building. 
ANDY: This guy looks like a real deviant. 
DWIGHT: No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those. 
ANDY: Aye, aye, Cap'n. 
DWIGHT: More like, "Aye, aye, General." 
MICHAEL:  I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it -  
MEREDITH: It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot. 
MICHAEL: Many women are competent drivers.  OK. Come on. 
DWIGHT:  This is what we know. 
JIM:  Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool. 
KEVIN: Yes. 
TOBY: Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight? 
JIM: Anna Maria's. 
RYAN: What's the occasion? 
JIM: Six-month anniversary. What? 
RYAN: Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up. 
JIM: No, we've been dating for six months. 
RYAN: Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um - 
JIM: Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend. 
RYAN: I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway. 
MICHAEL: All right. Hope nobody's on a diet. 
KELLY: Thanks, Michael. 
ANGELA: Thank you, Michael. 
MICHAEL: You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish. 
PAM: What do you want to dish about? 
MICHAEL: Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese. 
PAM: OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan? 
KELLY: Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome. 
MICHAEL: What, um... what do you think of role-play? 
PHYLLIS: Oh, it can be fun. 
MICHAEL: Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy. 
KAREN: It's a pretty common one. 
MICHAEL: I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress. 
ANGELA: OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store. 
ANGELA: Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls. 
PAM: Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with. 
MICHAEL: Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex. 
PAM: Oh, my God. 
MICHAEL:  And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form. 
KAREN: That is not healthy behavior. 
MICHAEL: No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it. 
PAM: Michael, you need to get out of this. 
MICHAEL: No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing. 
PAM: No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad.  
MICHAEL: No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK.  You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan?  
PAM: Read the pros first. 
MICHAEL: OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt. 
PHYLLIS: She does have very nice clothes. 
KAREN: OK, OK. Um, cons. 
MICHAEL: Cons. Wears too much makeup. 
BREASTS: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested. 
PAM: What was the last one? 
MICHAEL: She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles. 
PHYLLIS: No, the one before that. 
MICHAEL: I'm unhappy when I'm with her. 
PAM: Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy. 
MICHAEL: I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex. 
KAREN: Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, that's smart. 
PAM: Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other. 
MICHAEL: That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know. 
PHYLLIS: I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan? 
MICHAEL: I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan. 
PHYLLIS: My mom taught me that. 
MICHAEL: Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories. 
PAM: No one said it has no calories. 
MICHAEL: Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here. 
MICHAEL: Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked. 
KEVIN:  This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often. 
TOBY: I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time. 
CREED: What are you doing in here? This is the women's room. 
KEVIN: You're in here. 
CREED: I pay for that privilege.  
KEVIN:  OK. 
CREED:  I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly. 
MICHAEL: Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear. 
KAREN: Phyllis. What do you think? Too much? 
PHYLLIS: Jim's gonna love it.  
PAM: I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe. 
ANGELA:  Slower. Slower. Meredith.  Slow it up. 
MICHAEL: Oh. Oh, no.  It's Jan. What do I do? 
KAREN: Answer it. 
PAM: Don't answer it. 
MICHAEL: OK, it stopped. 
KELLY:  Whoa. 
MEREDITH:  Crap. 
JIM:  That is pretty cool. 
KELLY: Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right? 
MICHAEL: Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will... 
PAM: Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on. 
MICHAEL: Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see.  There we go!  Good. Yes, we have the... all right.  
PAM: I think I've got it. 
MICHAEL: Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan? 
PAM: I don't think we really need that, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail. 
PAM: You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy.  Coming! 
ANDY: Think we'll find him? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests. 
ANDY:  Halvsies? 
DWIGHT: No. Wholesies.  
ANDY: Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot. 
DWIGHT: Natch.  
ANDY: Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera. 
DWIGHT: You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass.  
MICHAEL: OK, I am really going to do this. 
PAM: Good luck, Michael. 
MICHAEL: You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it.  
KAREN: OK, remember, be strong. 
MICHAEL: I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail. 
PAM: Don't leave a - 
MICHAEL:  Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you.  OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later. 
JAN: Michael...  I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So...  I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
JAN: So... we're good? 
MICHAEL: Abso-fruit-ly. 
JAN:  Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry. 
MICHAEL: No... No... 
JAN: One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
JAN: OK.  "It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want..." 
MICHAEL: Maybe some Italian.  "... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -"  Chinese?  "who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy." 
JAN: Oh.  
MICHAEL:  Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. "Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all. 
DWIGHT:  Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute. 
JIM: Hey, Dwight. It's Jim. 
DWIGHT: Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy. 
JIM: No, you're not. I'm looking right at you. 
DWIGHT: Ugh. I'm hanging up. 
JIM: Don't.  I have information about the sex predator. 
DWIGHT: You have information about the sex predator? 
JIM: I saw him two minutes ago. 
DWIGHT: Where? 
JIM: In the women's bathroom, above the sink. 
DWIGHT:  Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm.  PAM! 
MICHAEL: Ughh... Blech. 
DWIGHT: OK, where does it hurt? 
MICHAEL: Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying... 
DWIGHT: No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body. 
MICHAEL: Right there.  
DWIGHT:  "Abdomen. Menses." 
MICHAEL: Maybe. 
DWIGHT: "The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it." 
MICHAEL: Not it. I don't have eggs. 
PAM: About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned. 
DWIGHT: Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste? 
MICHAEL: That's possible. 
PAM: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Uh-huh? 
PAM: David Wallace is on line one. 
MICHAEL: The CFO? Ohh... 
MICHAEL: OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK. 
MICHAEL: To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace? 
DAVID:  Michael, I am calling--- 
MICHAEL: And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there? 
DAVID: Jan is out of town right now. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes... 
DAVID: Michael? 
MICHAEL: ...you just gots to get your freak on. 
DAVID: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
DAVID: Michael? 
MICHAEL: Hmmm. 
DAVID: I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate. 
MICHAEL: Really? 
DAVID: Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch. 
MICHAEL: Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say. 
DAVID: That's not necessary. 
MICHAEL: May God guide you in your quest. 
DAVID: Yes. 
MICHAEL: OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus. 
MEREDITH: Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt  Oh, yeah... I packed it in my purse. 
MICHAEL: Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume? 
OSCAR: I don't wear a Speedo, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Well, you can't swim in leather pants.  I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally. 
TOBY: Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30. 
MICHAEL: Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going. 
TOBY: It's Beach Day... 
MICHAEL: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here. 
MICHAEL: I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck. 
TOBY: Hey, want my sun screen? 
PAM: Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece. 
TOBY: Uh-huh. 
PAM: Thanks Toby. 
MICHAEL: Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you 
PAM: I thought we were just having fun at the beach. 
MICHAEL: We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me. 
MICHAEL: What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head. 
PAM: You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities? 
MICHAEL: I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright? 
PAM: I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day? 
MICHAEL: This way to the partay bus. 
KEVIN: I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted. 
KEVIN:   And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right."  You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done. 
MICHAEL: Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach. 
STANLEY: Oh, sweet mother of God. 
MICHAEL: If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus. 
STANLEY: Excuse me? 
MICHAEL: Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner! 
DWIGHT: Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach. 
MICHAEL: Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off. 
DWIGHT: I hope there will be management parables. 
MICHAEL: Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down? 
PAM: Like what? 
MICHAEL: Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't... 
PAM: Well... no, I don't... exactly... what? 
MICHAEL: Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you. 
MICHAEL: Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg.  Watch out for snakes! 
ANGELA: Everyone put on sunscreen. 
MICHAEL: Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  OK, everybody up! Circle 'round.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor. 
OSCAR: What? 
MICHAEL: Just words. Inspiring words.  Not a contender.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley. 
DWIGHT: Yes! 
MICHAEL: Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam. 
MICHAEL: Jim Halpert. 
PROS: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? 
CONS: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something. 
DWIGHT: I choose Michael! 
MICHAEL: I'm not playing. 
DWIGHT: OK, temp. 
MICHAEL: Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot. 
MICHAEL: We are going to choose team names. Dwight? 
DWIGHT: We will be called Gryffindor. 
JIM: Really? Not Slytherin? 
DWIGHT: Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim. 
JIM: I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort. 
DWIGHT: He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that. 
JIM:  Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! 
DWIGHT: OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that. 
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name? 
STANLEY: I don't care what you call my team. 
MICHAEL: Then I will name your team the Red team. 
STANLEY: No , the blue team. 
MICHAEL: I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America. 
ANDY: We will be team U.S.A. 
MICHAEL: Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic. 
MICHAEL: Andy Bernard. 
PROS: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. 
CONS: I don't really trust him. 
MICHAEL: It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist. 
STANLEY: There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon. 
MICHAEL: Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!  
OSCAR: Come on Phyllis, you can do it.  Ahh... 
STANLEY: Thank you so much.  
ANDY: Phyllis is out. Yes!  Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good.  
KELLY: I don't want to hit the big rock! 
ANDY: Don't worry. You're not... 
KELLY: I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it. 
ANDY: No where near the big rock. 
KELLY:  I just don't want to get hit by it... 
ANDY: What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified. 
ANDY: I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard!  
JIM:  Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole. 
KAREN: Hole? 
JIM: Yup.  Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left. 
DWIGHT:  Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba! 
RYAN: Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore. 
DWIGHT: What are you saying? 
RYAN: You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race. 
DWIGHT: OK, I apologize for yelling at you. 
RYAN: That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team. 
DWIGHT: I am trying to bring team spirit. 
JIM:  Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step.  Yes! 
KAREN:  Oh my God! You ass!   
PAM: There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking.  
MICHAEL:  Pam...you're missing things.  
DWIGHT:  Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard!  What the? Damn it temp! 
ANDY:  Great job everyone, that was fantastic.  
MICHAEL: Okay Pam, I have another little project for you. 
PAM: Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs? 
MICHAEL: Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it. 
PAM: When's the contest? 
MICHAEL: Like umm... ten minutes? 
PAM: How am I supposed to... get... 
MICHAEL: Thanks a bunch. 
MICHAEL: A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success. 
MICHAEL: OK, who's hungry  No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest.  For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set. 
KELLY: Can I have a turkey burger? 
MICHAEL: No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready? 
OSCAR: Turkey is a healthy meat. 
DWIGHT: It's very good for you.  
MICHAEL: Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat! 
PHYLLIS: Is there any mustard? 
MICHAEL: No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily. 
MICHAEL: Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize. 
MEREDITH:  What is it? 
MICHAEL: I can't say. 
JIM: You can't say, or you can't pronounce it? 
MICHAEL: The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world. 
KELLY: Can we just take those first two things? 
MICHAEL: The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright? 
DWIGHT: You're leaving? 
MICHAEL: I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up. 
ANDY:  I am so hungry!  
STANLEY: Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis? 
MICHAEL:  Word.  There we go. Let's see it. 
STANLEY: I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on! 
MICHAEL: Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs! 
KELLY: Team U.S.A.! 
ANDY: One came up. 
MICHAEL: 13 hot dogs, everybody! 
DWIGHT: Damn it! 
CREED:  Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs! 
DWIGHT: Sabotage. 
ANGELA: What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich? 
DWIGHT: No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team. 
ANGELA: I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane. 
DWIGHT: If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me. 
MICHAEL: It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens. 
STANLEY: Uh, we don't have any safety mittens 
MICHAEL: Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go. 
KAREN: Get 'em big boy! 
MICHAEL: Aaaaaand, go! 
KAREN: C'mon, Jim! 
STANLEY:  
JIM: What are you doing? 
MICHAEL: Nice, Stanley! 
STANLEY:  Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight. 
JIM: Yeah. No. Good. 
JIM: Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day. 
OSCAR: If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see. 
DWIGHT:  Gaaaaa.... 
MICHAEL: One. Two. Three. 
DWIGHT: Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa! 
MICHAEL: Excellent! 
DWIGHT: Gryffindor! Gryffindor! 
ANDY: I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words. 
DWIGHT: That's not why you lost. 
ANDY: Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad. 
DWIGHT: Yeah, right. 
ANDY: Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon!  
DWIGHT:  Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that? 
ANDY:  Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody! 
ANGELA: What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them? 
ANDY: Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously! 
ANGELA: I don't understand what you want from me. 
ANDY: Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it! 
ANGELA: Sorry! Bye, Andy! 
ANDY: Angela! 
MICHAEL: I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points? 
PAM: I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units. 
MICHAEL: Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook. 
PAM: I really doubt it, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Please just check. 
JIM:  Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye. 
KAREN: Hello? Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well. 
JIM: In well? 
KAREN: As well. 
JIM: How would that work in well? I just want to know. 
KAREN: Yes. uh, huh. 
JIM: Wait a minute. 
KAREN: That would be fine. 
JIM: If this job is in a well, I don't want it. 
KAREN:  Cut it out! 
JIM: I don't! 
MICHAEL: What does a great manager need most of all? Courage. 
STANLEY: How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus. 
MICHAEL: Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE! 
MICHAEL: Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals. 
KEVIN: Are you going to try it? 
ANGELA: I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through. 
KEVIN: Angela, it is a million degrees. 
PAM: I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right? 
MICHAEL: No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score. 
PAM: I'd like to try it. 
MICHAEL: Pointless. 
PAM: But I'm not kidding. I really want to do it. 
MICHAEL: Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up. 
JIM: Nope. 
MICHAEL: Ji.. why not? C'mon. 
JIM: Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned. 
MICHAEL: You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager. 
JIM: That's harsh. 
MICHAEL: Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today. 
ANDY:  Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello? 
KEVIN: Why don't you go Michael? 
MICHAEL: Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill. 
JIM: And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself. 
MICHAEL: Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay.  The mind has to wrap around the foot.  Okay. 
PAM: Do you want us to count to three? 
MICHAEL: Yes. Count to three, please. 
GROUP: Three. Two. One. 
MICHAEL: Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one. 
GROUP: One. Two. Three! Go! Do it! Go, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three? 
CREED: On the go that's after three. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
GROUP: One, two, three, go! 
DWIGHT: No! It's okay. I will do this Michael. 
MICHAEL: Don't, don't. 
DWIGHT:  I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager! 
GROUP: Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving. 
DWIGHT:  GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB! 
MICHAEL: I'm not going to give it to you. 
DWIGHT:  Aaagh, aaagh! 
GROUP:  
PAM: Michael, do something! 
DWIGHT: Aggggh, that stings! 
MICHAEL: Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. "Outside Hire." 
ANGELA: Or Mrs. "Outside Hire." 
MICHAEL: Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor. 
KELLY: Who's Bob Hope? 
MICHAEL: God! He's a comedian. 
KELLY: Oh, like Amanda Bynes. 
MICHAEL: Who's Amanda Bynes? 
KELLY: She's from "What a Girl Wants." 
MICHAEL: Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got. 
JIM: Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement. 
MICHAEL: You are being too modest. 
JIM: Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York. 
MICHAEL: Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us. 
DWIGHT: The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act." And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats!" 
PAM:  Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh... 
DWIGHT:  I mean truly repulsive acts. 
MICHAEL: That is a very, very funny story. 
PAM:  Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day. 
MICHAEL: Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background. 
GROUP: Flintstones, meet the Flintstones. They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da. From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da.  When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time! 
MICHAEL: WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA! 
ANDY: Nice! 
MICHAEL:  David! 
DAVID:  Oh, Michael? 
MICHAEL: Are we all set? 
DAVID: Isn't our interview tomorrow? 
MICHAEL: Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello. 
DAVID: You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan? 
MICHAEL: Thought I'd catch a show. 
DAVID: In the middle of a work day? 
MICHAEL: Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job. 
DAVID: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Um, how many people are you interviewing? 
DAVID: We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people. 
MICHAEL: Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people? 
DAVID: I don't think so. 
MICHAEL: Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge? 
DAVID: I believe we put you in charge. 
MICHAEL: Ah, great. No further questions. 
DAVID: Okay, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DAVID: I'm really looking forward to our interview. 
MICHAEL: And I'm really looking forward to working with you. 
MICHAEL: I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons.  Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late. 
KEVIN:  Hey. 
JIM: Hey, Kev. 
KEVIN: What's different about you? You look worse. 
JIM: Thank you. 
MEREDITH: You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot. 
JIM: Ohhh... 
MEREDITH: Turn around. 
JIM: No. 
MEREDITH: Yes. 
JIM: No way. 
MEREDITH: Do it! 
ANDY: Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut. 
JIM:  Andy... 
ANDY: What is it, Big Haircut? 
JIM: Nothing. 
ANDY: Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut. 
JIM: Yup. 
ANDY: What? 
JIM: Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless. 
PAM: Hey. I think it looks great. 
JIM: Thanks, Pam. 
PAM: After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so  thank you. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah. 
DWIGHT: You wanted to see me? 
MICHAEL: Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute. 
DWIGHT: But that's my name.  Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch.  Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Okay. Uh... 
DWIGHT:  Thank you, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Uh, okay. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you so much. 
MICHAEL: Stop crying. 
DWIGHT:  Thank you. 
MICHAEL: Ohhhhh... 
PAM: Hey. 
KAREN: Hey. 
PAM: Um, about the beach... 
KAREN: It's okay, we all say things without thinking. 
PAM: Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird. 
KAREN:  Oh. Okay. 
KAREN: Pam is... kind of a bitch. 
KAREN: Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit. 
JIM: Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do.  Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it. 
JIM: So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city. 
MICHAEL: Why so you can do it? 
KAREN:  
JIM: Whoops. 
MICHAEL: No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... 
JIM: Hmmm. 
KAREN: Heh. 
MICHAEL: Moon each other. 
JIM: Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right? 
MICHAEL: All right. 
JIM: All right. 
MICHAEL: Your loss. 
KAREN: Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving? 
MICHAEL: Cruise control. 
KAREN: Oh. 
KEVIN: So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen? 
JIM: Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now. 
KEVIN: Pam is taller. 
JIM: You sure? 
KEVIN: Yes. She has bigger breasts, too. 
JIM: Wow. 
KEVIN: I think Karen has a prettier face. 
JIM: Uh, hmm.  Uh, hmm. What else? 
KEVIN: Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call. 
JIM: Hm. Really tough call. 
KEVIN: Yeah. 
JIM: You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got. 
KEVIN: Will do. 
JIM: All right.  
OSCAR: Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship.  
PAM: Wow, very funny. 
STANLEY: I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly. 
KELLY: Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam. 
PAM:  
MEREDITH: You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said. 
CREED: I remember. I blogged the whole thing. 
CREED: www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out. 
RYAN: Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking. 
MICHAEL: There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks. 
KEVIN: Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York? 
MICHAEL: No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me. 
OSCAR: Maybe you should talk to her? Before... 
MICHAEL: No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo. 
OSCAR: Michael... 
KEVIN: What? 
ANGELA: Why? 
OSCAR: I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense. 
MICHAEL: Yes, I... 
ANGELA: Wha? Who gave you that advice? 
KEVIN: Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo... 
MICHAEL: I have to buy another place. 
ANGELA: But you said you were in debt.  
OSCAR: You're not sure that you have the job. 
MICHAEL: I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time. 
DWIGHT: How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton? 
ANGELA: No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome. 
DWIGHT: No, no, not Michael.  Me. I'm taking his job. 
ANGELA:  Not now.  Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor. 
DWIGHT:  Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. 
JIM: Oh hey, Dwight. 
DWIGHT: I am gonna be your new boss.  It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never. 
JIM: Does my room have cable? 
DWIGHT: No. And the sheets are made of fire. 
JIM: Can I change rooms? 
DWIGHT: Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town. 
JIM: Can I have a late checkout? 
DWIGHT: I'll have to talk to the manager. 
JIM: You're not the manager even in your own fantasy? 
DWIGHT: I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan! 
JIM: Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil? 
DWIGHT: Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet. 
JIM: Go. 
DWIGHT: Eighty thousand dollars a year. 
DWIGHT: Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified. 
ANDY:  I will see you at the inter-view. 
DWIGHT: Yes you will. 
MICHAEL: Who is D. Abramson? 
PAM: He's from that company in Pitts... 
JAN:  Michael. 
MICHAEL: Why... are you here? 
JAN: Uh, how are you? 
MICHAEL: I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you. 
JAN: I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute? 
MICHAEL: Why privately? 
JAN: I just,  I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things. 
MICHAEL: Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of. 
JAN: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem. 
PAM: What do you want me to do? 
MICHAEL: Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen. 
PAM: What about Meredith? 
MICHAEL: No. She's an alternate. 
MICHAEL: So, how you been? 
JAN: Been good. 
MICHAEL: Good. 
JAN: Good. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
JAN: Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail. 
MICHAEL: Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages. 
PAM: So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room. 
KAREN: 'Cause of Jan again? 
KAREN: Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow? 
PAM: Uh, sure. 
KAREN: Thanks. 
PAM: I really hope you get the job. 
KAREN: Thanks.  
JAN: After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation. 
MICHAEL: Hmm. 
JAN: To kinda clear my mind. 
MICHAEL: Sound good. Sounds fun. 
JAN: It was. Yeah, it was good.  I think I'll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time. 
MICHAEL: Hmm.. 
JAN: I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together. 
MICHAEL: Would you excuse me for a second? 
JAN: Ohh...  
MICHAEL: Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together. 
PHYLLIS: What are you gonna do? 
MICHAEL: I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please... 
KAREN: Do you want to get back together with her? 
MICHAEL: No, no. What do I do? 
PAM: Just don't get back together with her. 
MICHAEL: What if she makes me? 
ANGELA: How can she make you get back together with her? 
MICHAEL: She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do. 
PAM: This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her. 
MICHAEL: I wasn't. 
PAM: You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong. 
MICHAEL: You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together. 
PAM: Right. 
MICHAEL: Wow. 
KAREN: Do it. 
MICHAEL: I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you. 
MICHAEL:  Okay.  Jan, we need to talk.  
MICHAEL: Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out. 
PAM: Oh my God.  Huge! 
JIM: Yeah, bigger actually. 
PAM:  That's crazy! 
JIM: Mm-hm. 
PAM:  Wow! 
KAREN:  Oh my God. Can you believe that? 
JIM: Unbelievable. 
KAREN: Wow! 
JIM: She could put the cup right there. 
KAREN: I know! 
PAM: No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that one time. 
MEREDITH: I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front. 
KEVIN: I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers. 
CREED: I find it offensive. Au natural, baby. That's how I like 'em. Swing low, sweet chariots. 
JAN: So...  there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently. 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
JAN: I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities. 
MICHAEL: First got priorities. 
JAN: And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation... 
MICHAEL: Let's get back together.  
MICHAEL: No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent. 
DWIGHT: Okay, everyone, listen up!  Time to begin the interview process!  Andrew Bernard. 
ANDY: Saving the best for first! 
KAREN: All right, you guys. See you later, wish us luck! 
DWIGHT: No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael. 
OSCAR: Good luck, you guys!  
DWIGHT: What did I say!? 
PAM:  Good luck. 
JIM: Thanks. 
PAM: I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am.  That's Popeye. 
DWIGHT: I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color? 
ANDY: White, because it contains all other colors. 
DWIGHT: Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table? 
ANDY: You make a chair, but you don't sit on it. 
DWIGHT: What is the capital of Maine? 
ANDY: The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell. 
DWIGHT: Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company. 
ANDY: Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended. 
DWIGHT: You're not off to a very good start, Bernard. 
ANDY: I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say? 
ANDY: I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else 
HAS: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous. 
DWIGHT:  Time! No, you failed. 
ANDY: Damn it! 
DWIGHT: This interview is over. I'll let you know. 
KAREN:  Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview. 
JIM: Totally, no problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or... 
KAREN: Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house. 
JIM: Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too? What did she accomplish? 
KAREN: No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me. 
JIM: Oh... 
KAREN: 'Cause I'm going to get the job. 
MICHAEL:  Remarkable. 
JAN: Thanks. 
MICHAEL: Wait, wait. Check one more time. 
JAN: Oh, okay. 
MICHAEL: Very good  
JAN: Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right? 
MICHAEL: Yes, indeed. 
JAN: Good luck with your interview.  Bye. 
MICHAEL: So, I guess we're getting back together. 
PAM: What happened? 
MICHAEL: Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger. 
MICHAEL: Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery. 
KAREN: So we have all night. Where do you want to go first? 
JIM: Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.? 
KAREN: How often do you come here? 
JIM: Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip. 
KAREN: I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim. 
MICHAEL: Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  I would like to start saying my goodbyes 
 Okay. Goodnight, and good luck. 
DWIGHT:  Who's ready to work? 
JIM:  Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels. 
KAREN: That wasn't him.  
KAREN: So what's going to happen to us when I get this job? 
JIM: Oh do you mean when I get the job? 
KAREN: Well, if you get the job then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid. I was at the beach. We won't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there. 
JIM: You mean Kevin? 
KAREN: Exactly. But you get it, right? Can't stay there. 
JIM: Yeah, I do. C'mon.  
MICHAEL:  How are you guys doing? Need anything? 
KAREN: Uh, no, we're good. Thanks. 
MICHAEL: I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me. 
JIM:  Who's that? 
MICHAEL: That is Beardy. 
JIM: Beardy? 
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm. 
JIM: I'm gonna introduce myself. 
MICHAEL: No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so... 
MICHAEL: I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep. 
DWIGHT: Michael is gone. 
ANDY: Hail to the chief! 
DWIGHT: My first order of 
BUSINESS: make Andrew Bernard my number two. 
ANDY: My first order of 
BUSINESS: accept. 
DWIGHT: As if you had a choice.  Duh.  Opportunity of a lifetime.  
ANDY: Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad.  
MICHAEL: Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire. 
HUNTER: Uh, administrative assistant. 
MICHAEL: Jan in yet? 
HUNTER: I think she's comin' in... later. 
MICHAEL: Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in? 
HUNTER: Sure. 
MICHAEL: Just say, "I want to squeeze them." It's code. She'll know what it means. 
HUNTER: Okay. 
MICHAEL: Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her,  "Brbrbrbrbr!" also? 
DWIGHT: You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession. 
PAM: Thank you. 
DWIGHT: I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager. 
PAM: Really? 
DWIGHT: Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position. 
PAM: You will be your own assistant. 
DWIGHT: Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills. 
PAM: Okay. So... you would be the Regional Manager, and the Assistant Regional Manager. Andy is your number two. I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager. 
DWIGHT: Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
PAM: Mm-hmm. 
DWIGHT: Do you accept? 
PAM: Absolutely, I do. 
PAM: I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, "Absolutely, I do." 
MICHAEL:  Hello, hello! 
DAVID: Michael, good to see you! 
MICHAEL: Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for. 
DAVID: Oh, great. I've been meaning to thank you by the way. You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget? That is nice work.  So, let me ask you a question right off the bat. What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager? 
MICHAEL: Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job. 
DAVID: Okay. And your strengths? 
MICHAEL: Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths. 
DAVID: Oh. Yes. Very good. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
DAVID: Very good. 
PHYLLIS: Dwight is our new boss. 
OSCAR: Oh, Michael's not going anywhere. 
PAM: Then who do you think will get the job? 
KEVIN: Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits. 
PHYLLIS: I think it's gonna be Michael. 
OSCAR: Do you really think he's qualified for that job? 
PHYLLIS: No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one. 
OSCAR:  Mm. Yeah. 
DWIGHT: Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This...  is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch. 
PAM:  What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck? 
DWIGHT: Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent. 
OSCAR: So ten thousand of your dollars is worth one real dollar? 
DWIGHT: Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings! 
STANLEY: Amen. 
DWIGHT: Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper. 
KEVIN:  Do we have to? 
DWIGHT: Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is "me." Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you! 
PAM: I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here. 
DAVID: What do you think we could be doing better? 
MICHAEL: I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper. It's super duper." I don't know, something like that. 
DAVID: Okay! 
MICHAEL: Okay. 
DAVID: Thanks for comin' in, Michael. 
MICHAEL: Thank you. 
DAVID: It is always a treat when our paths cross. 
MICHAEL: It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together. So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again. 
DAVID: You're back together. 
MICHAEL: Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.  Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals. 
DAVID: Okay, uh. Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job. 
MICHAEL: I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it? 
DAVID: No, we're letting Jan go. 
DWIGHT: Listen up. Let's start... from the ground up. Where does paper come from? 
KEVIN:  Trees. 
DWIGHT: Trees! And where do trees grow? 
KEVIN:  Forest. 
DWIGHT: Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right?  Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state? 
STANLEY: Liquid. 
DWIGHT: Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck. 
STANLEY: I don't want it. 
DWIGHT: Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks! 
STANLEY: Make it 100. 
DWIGHT: We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks? 
STANLEY: No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again. 
DWIGHT: What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks? 
STANLEY: The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns. 
DWIGHT: Okay--- 
ANDY: That's it! 
DWIGHT: What--- 
ANDY: Class is canceled, everybody out! 
DWIGHT: No wait, what are you doing?! 
ANDY: I'm punishing them. 
DWIGHT: No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled. 
EVERYONE:  
PAM: HEY! COME ON! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation!  
OSCAR: What--- What are you winking for? 
DWIGHT: Zip your lid! 
KAREN: So, that's... my basic 5 year plan. And after that, who knows? 
DAVID: Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but... 
KAREN: Yeah? 
DAVID: ...what do you think about Michael Scott? 
KAREN: He's a very nice man. And he's very well suited for the job he has now. 
DAVID: This is off the record. 
KAREN: He would be disaster. 
JAN: Hey you! 
MICHAEL: Hey. 
JAN: How was your interview? 
MICHAEL: Pretty good. 
JAN: Yeah? 
MICHAEL: Could have gone better I guess. 
JAN: Oh.  I'll put in a good word for you. 
MICHAEL: Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later. 
JAN: What? 
MICHAEL: Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun. 
JAN: What's... what's the matter? What... what happened in there? 
MICHAEL: I can't tell you. 
JAN: Tell me what? 
JAN: You son of a bitch! 
DAVID: Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview--- 
JAN: You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off? 
DAVID: Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic. 
JAN: Erratic? 
DAVID: Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work! You smoke constantly in your office. You spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days. Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you used to--- 
JAN:  Is it because of these? 
MICHAEL: Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan--- 
JAN: No, I wanna know. I wanna know! Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court! 
DAVID: It's not. 
JAN: No? 
DAVID: It's not. 
JAN: 'Cause he likes them.  Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about. 
DAVID: The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable. 
MICHAEL: Hey! You're unstable! 
JAN: Yeah! 
MICHAEL: No--- We're all unstable. 
JAN: Okay, you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. Not leaving. 
MICHAEL: David, I did not tell her. 
ANDY: It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall. 
DWIGHT: It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black.  
ANDY: This is gonna look so awesome! 
DWIGHT: It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here! 
ANDY:  Totally! 
JAN:  Bye Hunter. 
HUNTER: Bye. 
JAN: Good luck with your band. 
HUNTER: Oh, thank--- 
JAN: Don't let them change you, okay?  So long, . 
MICHAEL: So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job. 
DAVID: Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction. 
MICHAEL: Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions. 
DAVID: No, we're not giving you the job. 
MICHAEL: You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal? 
DAVID: I do. 
MICHAEL: Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though. 
DAVID: Yes. 
MICHAEL: Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two.  Either one of them... excellent candidates. 
KAREN: Wow. That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction. 
JIM: Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though. 
KAREN: Don't! She's nuts!  
JIM: Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want. 
KAREN: Okay, good! Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch. And, I was gonna meet them, so... 
JIM: Okay. 
KAREN: Just call me when you're done. 
JIM: Sure. 
KAREN: Good luck, Halpert. 
JIM: Thank you. 
RECEPTIONIST:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure. 
JAN: Oh, God! I mean, I just don't understand! It's just so rude, you know? I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy! 
MICHAEL: I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible. 
JAN: Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know? It's fine, actually, I do. I really think it's great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so...  
MICHAEL: Well, it's...  No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK. 
JAN:  Oh, I know, I know. It's just... I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do? 
MICHAEL:  I don't know.  Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale.  Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile. 
JAN: Live together. Actually, wait a minute! This could be great! This could be perfect! You know, my full-time job could be our relationship. I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15.  It could work. This could work, really! 
MICHAEL:  I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack! 
PAM: How'd it go? 
MICHAEL: No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon. 
MICHAEL: Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. "Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in." Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black? 
DWIGHT: To intimidate my subordinates. 
MICHAEL: That's stupid. 
DWIGHT: It was Andy's idea. 
MICHAEL: You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  Ryan, coffee. 
RYAN: I don't do that stuff anymore. 
MICHAEL: No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids. 
MICHAEL: So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones. 
PAM: Did... Karen get the job? 
MICHAEL:  Back to work.  Still waitin' on that coffee. 
DWIGHT: Pam, hello. 
PAM: Dwight, hello. 
DWIGHT: I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity.  
PAM: No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I... are just... too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man. A man version. But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay. 
DAVID: I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan. 
JIM: I should leave.   
DAVID: Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy. 
JIM: Thanks. 
DAVID: Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet--- 
JIM: I'm sorry, wait, so is the question "How'd I get to be so awesome?"  Because, I don't have an answer for you.  
DAVID: Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers? 
JIM: Yes, absolutely. 
DAVID: And that, uh, questionnaire. Sorry to make you fill that thing out... 
JIM: Oh, no, absolutely. 
DAVID: ...that's a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  Kendall. Ugh. So, first up... 
JIM:  There you go. 
DAVID: How do you think you function here in New York? 
JIM:  What's that? Oh, uh, great. You know? I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a  energy... New York has, uh... Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  So that's a... bonus. 
DAVID: You've been in the Scranton branch a long time.  What have you liked most about that place? 
JIM:  The friendships. 
DAVID: Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So... long haul. Where do you see yourself in ten years? 
JIM:  How are your feet? 
PAM: Medium rare. Thanks.  
JIM: The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here. 
PAM: I know. 
JIM: And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back. 
PAM: Well, I wish you would. 
PAM:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just one moment, I'll transfer you. 
PAM: I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally---  
JIM: Pam.  Sorry.  Um, are you free for dinner tonight? 
PAM: Yes. 
JIM: All right. Then... it's a date. 
PAM:  I'm sorry, what was the question? 
DAVID:  So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty. But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  Great! I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here. 
RYAN:  I'm excited too. Okay. Bye. 
KELLY: Who was that? 
RYAN:  Nobody. You and I are done. 
KELLY: What?!
